The biggest thing with comfort is that I can lie in my bed and use \u0027The Link\u0027. Any other assistive technology had to have someone else help or have me sit up. Sitting causes stress mentally and on my body which would give me pressure sores or spasms. It lets me live on my own time, not needing to have someone adjust me, etc. throughout the day.  \u0027The Link\u0027 has helped me reconnect with the world, my friends, and my family. It\u0027s given me the ability to do things on my own again without needing my family at all hours of the day and night.‚Äù",

      "Content": "The Trudeau regime has introduced an Orwellian new law called the Online Harms Bill C-63, which will give police the power to retroactively search the Internet for ‚Äòhate speech‚Äô violations and arrest offenders, even if the offence occurred before the law existed. This new bill is aimed at safeguarding the masses from so-called ‚Äúhate speech.‚Äù Revolver.news reports: The real shocker in this bill is the alarming retroactive aspect. Essentially, whatever you‚Äôve said in the past can now be weaponized against you by today‚Äôs draconian standards. Historian Dr. Muriel Blaive has weighed in on this draconian law, labeling it outright ‚Äúmad.‚Äù She points out how it literally spits in the face of all Western legal traditions, especially the one about only being punished if you infringed on a law that was valid at the time of committing a crime. https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/canada-to-imprison-anyone-who-has-ever-posted-hate-speech-online/",

    "Content": "Act on press  This is a UI design hill I will die on, and it dismays me how often and hard I have had to fight for it.  Almost all interaction methods have a ‚Äúpress‚Äù and ‚Äúrelease‚Äù event associated with them. Whenever possible, you should ‚Äúdo the thing‚Äù when you get the press event instead of waiting for the release event, because it makes the interaction feel substantially more responsive, and it reduces user errors by not allowing the focus to slide out of the hot box between press and release.  Even a ‚Äúballistic tap‚Äù, where your finger is intentionally bouncing off the button or touch surface, involves several tens of milliseconds delay between the press and release, and most button presses have well over a hundred ms dwell time. There is a delight in interfaces that feel like they respond instantly to your wishes, and the benefit to every single user is often more important than additional niche features.  Game developers, with simple UI toolkits, tend to get this right more often, but ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù app designers will often fight hard against it because it is mostly incompatible with options like interactive touch scrolling views, long press menus, and drag and drop.  Being able to drag scroll a web page or view with interactive controls in it is here to stay, and nets out way better than having to use a separate scroll bar, but there are still tons of fixed position controls that should act on press, and it is good UI design to favor them when possible.  In the early days of mobile VR, the system keyboard was a dedicated little OpenGL app that responded instantly. With full internationalization it became prudent to turn it into a conventional Android app, but the default act-on-release button behavior made it feel noticeably crappier. The design team resisted a push to change it, and insisted on commissioning a user study, which is a corporate politics ploy to bury something. I was irritated at how they tried to use leading questions and tasks, but It still came back one of the clearest slam-dunks I have seen for user testing ‚Äì objectively less typos, expressed preference, and interview comments about the act-on-press version feeling ‚Äúcrisper‚Äù and ‚Äúmore responsive‚Äù.  So, I won that one, but the remaining times I brought it up for other interfaces, I did not, and you still see act-on-release throughout the Meta VR system interfaces.",

    "Content": "New: @elonmusk emailed me about his plan for AI news on X.   The idea is to use AI to blend breaking news and commentary, building real-time summaries of events. Then you can go deeper via chat on Grok.  Here\u0027s the full story! I\u0027ll be talking more about this on Big Technology Podcast later today.   Elon Musk‚Äôs Plan For AI News  Elon Musk emailed me this week with some  surprising details about his plan to distill and present news on X using  AI. I‚Äôd written him after trying Grok ‚Äî X‚Äôs AI chatbot ‚Äî and noticing  it didn‚Äôt LinkTweet to a Time story it summarized. I wanted to click into the  article and read more, so I reached out.  Musk said better  citations are coming, but shared a deeper vision for the product, which  he wants to build into a real-time synthesizer of news and social media  reaction. Effectively, his plan is to use AI to combine breaking news  and social commentary around big stories, present the compilation live,  and allow you to go deeper via chat.  ‚ÄúAs more information becomes  available, the news summary will upPostingDate to include that information,‚Äù  Musk told me. ‚ÄúThe goal is simple: to provide maximally accurate and  timely information, citing the most significant sources.‚Äù  That  goal won‚Äôt be easy to achieve, but the bot might become a novel news  product given its access to the X firehose. ‚ÄúGrok is analyzing sometimes  tens of thousands of X posts to render a news summary,‚Äù Musk said.  Already,  Grok is displaying a running list of headlines and incorporating social  reaction into its summaries, including the chatter around the Time  story I sought about Trump‚Äôs potential second term. Grok has plenty of room to improve¬†‚Äî and will have to figure out issues like citation  and hallucination ‚Äî but it could be valuable if X gets the execution is  right.  ‚ÄúThat\u0027s actually what I used to come to Twitter for¬†‚Äî news and commentary,‚Äù @semaforben, editor-in-chief of Semafor and author of Traffic, told me.  Conversation  on X will make up the core of Grok‚Äôs summaries ‚Äî¬†or, really almost all  of it. Musk said Grok will not look directly at article Content, and will  instead rely solely on social posts. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs summarizing what people say  on X,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDefinitely needs to do a better job of displaying  relevant posts, including, for example, the TIME post that LinkTweets to the  article.‚Äù  Musk‚Äôs approach will make Grok distinct from all AI news  summarizers, and likely more controversial, but there is an opportunity  to satisfy users, publishers, and the platform together. It starts with  solid citation, giving users a way to go deeper into the source  material once their curiosity is piqued.  Josh Miller (@joshm), CEO of The Browser Company,  whose Arc browser is doing AI summarization, told me that platforms,  users, and publishers could all win with aggressive citation. ‚ÄúPeople  want trust in the data,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey want to understand where it\u0027s  coming from. And more importantly, if we do a good job giving them what  they want, they want more of it. They get more curious. They want to  read deeper.‚Äù  Grok  could similarly be an entry point to news stories that people might  otherwise not see, giving them more reason to come back and engage. ‚ÄúI  definitely don\u0027t go to Time.com,‚Äù Miller said. ‚ÄúSo if that was pushed to  me, I would probably go read that Time article. And I wouldn\u0027t have  seen it otherwise.‚Äù  Igor Babuschkin, a technical staff member  working at Musk‚Äôs xAI, said his team is focused on ‚Äúmaking Grok  understand the news purely from what is posted on X.‚Äù Regarding  citation, he said that ‚Äúsince news is often discussed on X, this can  sometimes lead to Grok making references to existing news outlets. We  are working on improving the citations so that we reliably capture who  the information in the article comes from.‚Äù  For publishers, the  value exchange on social media has long been fraught, and this time‚Äôs no  different. News companies‚Äô work ‚Äî like the Time article¬†‚Äî drives news  cycles. Summarizing that work without a prominent LinkTweet back could cut  them off from the economic reward, harming their ability to produce  more. That said, publishers are moving away from subsisting on social  media traffic, which has always been tenuous, even as the fallout‚Äôs been  brutal for the industry.  ‚ÄúAs an editor in this basically  post-Twitter news environment, I would much rather the platform was  taking my content than taking my journalists‚Äô time,‚Äù Semafor‚Äôs Smith  said.  Building summaries just from the posts on X ‚Äî and not  the articles themselves ‚Äî could give X some distance from the publisher  lawsuits hitting AI companies. Eight newspapers sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement this week, for instance. And the New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft as well.  Courts  tend to include commentary under the provision for fair use, as opposed  to original work, said Danielle Coffey, president and CEO of the  News/Media Alliance, which represents thousands of news publishers. But  using just commentary to summarize the original source, she said, ‚Äúis a  bit too cute by half though.‚Äù  Under Musk, X seemed to initially  deprioritize news ‚Äî with the temporary removal of headlines from  articles, verification revocations, and some initial algorithm changes ‚Äî  but Musk‚Äôs emails demonstrate that he still views news as a core X  capacity. It‚Äôs a potential competitive advantage as competitors like  Meta‚Äôs Threads distance themselves from news.  In a perfect world,  original sources and commentary could blend in Grok, drawing details  from insiders, analysis from outsiders, and commentary from the herd.  Leaders at Twitter had long dreamed of such a scenario. And perhaps the  latest breakthroughs in generative AI have made it worth trying once more.

I think you saw that play out after October 7. ‚Ä¶ If you looked at what happened right after October 7, you saw a lot of young people not even take a moment to really acknowledge what had happened in Israel, and how horrific that was.

      "Content": "EXCLUSIVE: Internal DHS data reveals the 45+ U.S. cities that hundreds of thousands of migrants have flown into via the Biden administration\u0027s controversial \"CHNV\" mass parole program. The data was obtained by @HomelandGOP via a subpoena to DHS, and was provided to @FoxNews. The DHS data shows that during an 8 month stretch from January through August 2023, roughly 200,000 migrants flew into the U.S. via the program, with 80% of them, (161,562) arriving in the state of Florida in four cities: Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Orlando, \u0026 Tampa.  The top 15 cities migrants flew into, \u0026 the numbers during this 8 month window, are below.  1) Miami, FL: 91,821 2) Ft. Lauderdale, FL: 60,461 3) New York City, NY: 14,827 4) Houston, TX: 7,923 5) Orlando, FL: 6,043 6) Los Angeles, CA: 3,271 7) Tampa, FL: 3,237 8) Dallas, TX: 2,256 9) San Francisco, CA: 2,052 10) Atlanta, GA: 1,796 11) Newark, NJ: 1,498 12) Washington, D.C.: 1,472 13) Chicago, IL: 496 14) Las Vegas, NV: 483 15) Austin, TX: 171  I\u0027ve attached the raw DHS data provided in the subpoena response showing all of the locations the migrants flew into during these 8 months in the chart below.   DHS also revealed in the subpoena response that as of October 2023, there was a backlog about 1.6 million applicants waiting for DHS approval to fly to the U.S. via the parole program.   In response to the DHS data revealing Florida received the overwhelming majority of migrant flights during the 8 month window, FL. Gov. @RonDeSantis\u0027s office provided FOX the following statement:  \"Biden\u0027s parole program is unlawful, and constitutes an abuse of constitutional authority. Florida is currently suing Biden to shut it down, and we believe that we will prevail.\" - @JeremyRedfernFL, DeSantis\u0027 Press Secretary.  DHS also wrote in the subpoena response that \"All individuals paroled into the United States are, by definition, inadmissible, including those paroled under the CHNV processes.\"  Congressman @RepMarkGreen, Chairman of @HomelandGOP, told FOX in response:  \"What they\u0027re essentially saying is that the laws passed by Congress have said that these people are inadmissible, and so they created a program to try to get around those laws. The thing is, they don\u0027t have the authority to create such a program. By their own admission, they\u0027re breaking the law.\"  Reminder: The CHNV parole program, created by the Biden admin in January 2023, allows up to 30,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, \u0026 Venezuela to bypass the southern border entirely, and fly into the U.S. directly from foreign countries for a two year humanitarian parole grant if they have a sponsor in the U.S., and are vetted/approved for travel. The flights are commercial, and are not funded by taxpayers. The program recipient or their sponsor pays for it, and the parole grant allows the recipient to apply to work. The Biden admin considers the program a \"lawful pathway\", and the migrants flying into the U.S. via the program are not included in the southern border numbers.  According to CBP data, at least 404,000 migrants have flown into the U.S. via the CHNV parole program since it first began:  154,000 Haitians 95,000 Venezuelans 84,000 Cubans 69,000 Nicaraguans  So far, legal challenges to this controversial parole program have failed in court. A Texas lawsuit was dismissed earlier this year after a judge ruled the state didn\u0027t have standing to sue. More lawsuits are pending.  The Biden admin says the program is a lawful use of executive parole authority. They consider the program a success, and believe it provides an incentive to not cross the US border illegally. The numbers of Haitians and Cubans crossing illegally have steeply fallen as a result of the program.  Critics say the program essentially waves a magic wand to mass import hundreds of thousands of otherwise inadmissible migrants into the US, with the likelihood of them ever leaving or being deported if they stay past the permitted parole grant being remarkably low.",

And people priced out of their housing for reasons unrelated to addiction or untreated mental illness find another place to live. They don\u0027t pitch a tent on the dirtiest and most dangerous sidewalks in America.   The reason the problem grew so much worse is that a handful of well-financed ideological activists persuaded cities and states to incentivize homelessness through unconditional cash payments, promises of unconditional free housing, and the decriminalization of shoplifting and open-air drug dealing.   Last week I released a short video on how progressive West Coast cities made homelessness worse. Now, I\u0027m happy to release this hour-long video that goes through the evidence about the nature of the problem and how to solve it in great detail.",

Baja Mode ‚Äì Vehicle balance is improved \u0026 the vehicle handles more freely when Stability Assist is set to Minimal.  Locking Differentials (Dual Motor AWD) | Off-Road Mode  On uneven or slippery terrain, if a wheel has limited or no traction, Cybertruck can direct that torque to the opposite wheel.  In Off-Road Mode, choose from Locking Differentials options on the vehicle status area or in the Off-Road app.  Front Locking Differential (Cyberbeast Tri Motor) | Off-Road Mode  Go to Off-Road Mode \u003e Overland to enable Locking Differential feature. Cyberbeast tri motor has a virtual rear locked differential which is always working in overland mode.  Trail Assist | Off-Road Mode It‚Äôs like cruise control, but for off-roading. Trail Assist helps maintain a set cruising speed so you can focus on steering. Trail Assist works as both a hill ascent and descent control helping to keep the wheels from slipping. Off-Road Mode \u003e Trail Assist  Slippery Surface | On-Road  Better traction control on snowy, icy, wet, or slick roads to distribute traction evenly across all tires.

    "Content": "The problem with ‚ÄúGreat Replacement Theory‚Äù is that it fails to address the foundational issue of low birth rates.  Record low birth rates are leading to population collapse in Europe and even faster population collapse in most of Asia. Immigration is low in Asia, so there is no ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù going on, the countries are simply shrinking away.  If this doesn‚Äôt turn around, then any countries on Earth with low birth rates will become empty of people and fall into ruin, like the remains we see of the many long dead civilizations.",

Also odd that it‚Äôs not even vaguely bipartisan, has zero open source AI CEOs (Zuckerberg) and excludes Elon who has been the highest profile advocate for AI safety over the last 10 years.  The incumbents will be lobbying hard against open source which would be terrible policy that maximizes the odds of a world with 2-3 dominant AIs, which is the riskiest scenario IMO.  We want a multipolar world of AIs that reflect the rich diversity of human cultures rather than a few AIs grounded in the extremist subset of western culture embodied in Gemini and ChatGPT.",

      "Content": "The Dirty Little Secret About Homelessness Is Also The Key To Ending It  The US Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments about what cities can and cannot do to end homelessness.  \"What if there is a bed available in the Gospel Rescue Mission, but Ms. Johnson, a person, doesn\u0027t want it? Doesn‚Äôt wish to leave their pet. Her Rottweiler\u0027s not permitted there. So that is a difficult question for a person and a difficult policy question...\"  What everyone agreed on was that homelessness is a difficult problem.  \"Many people have mentioned this is a serious policy problem‚Ä¶ So,  the policy questions in this case are very difficult‚Ä¶.Martin speaks in terms of someone who is involuntarily homeless and that raises all of those policy questions‚Ä¶ We usually think about whether state law, local law already achieves those purposes so that the federal courts aren\u0027t micromanaging homeless policy‚Ä¶\"  I think most people listening to the Supreme Court would agree: it isn‚Äôt going to solve homelessness. That is a job for state legislators. So why haven‚Äôt they? Why has homelessness gotten worse?  The answer that many homeless advocates give is that it‚Äôs because we don‚Äôt have enough homes, and poverty has increased. But neither is true. Poverty has steadily declined since the 1980s, when homelessness first became an issue of public concern.  And very few people are on the street simply because they can‚Äôt afford the rent.  The evidence is overwhelming that the majority of people on the street are there because of untreated mental illness or addiction, which leads people to use all their money to support their drug habit and be high, rather than work.  People who can‚Äôt afford the rent but are able to work and aren‚Äôt in the grip of addiction or untreated mental illness find a cheaper place to live, move somewhere cheaper, or live with family and friends.  It‚Äôs true there aren‚Äôt enough shelter beds, case workers, group homes, and psychiatric hospitals to care for the homeless.  But a big part of the reason for that is that advocates for the homeless have, for 40 years, demanded that funding for dealing with the homeless go into giving people private studio apartments rather than building sufficient shelter beds.  They call this ‚ÄúHousing First,‚Äù and its record is awful. Few stay in housing, and many die because it fails to treat the cause of the problem, addiction, and untreated mental illness rather than the symptoms.  Studies find that cities that prioritize basic shelter over expensive housing reduce the deaths of homeless by 3-fold. And so in LA, homeless die at a rate 3 times higher than New York because living inside protects people from murder, drug overdose, and car accidents.  Making matters worse, homeless advocates, along with the ACLU, have opposed expanding psychiatric hospitals, and mandatory care in general, because they believe it‚Äôs worse to manPostingDate hospitalization for people who are dangerously psychotic or manic than to simply leave them on the street.  But it‚Äôs not. Last year, 112,000 Americans died from drug overdose and poisoning because we failed to manPostingDate treatment. Two of my friends from high school would still be alive today had we manPostingDated they get treatment for addiction rather than letting them die.  What is happening on homelessness is a record of failure. The number of drug deaths quintupled from 20,000 in 2022 to 112,000 last year. That‚Äôs more people dying per year than died in Hiroshima.  Homelessness is not a fundamental problem of housing. It‚Äôs a problem of enabling addiction and untreated mental illness, both of which lead people to give up on work, lie, steal, cheat their families and friends, and live on the street, where they turn to petty crime to sustain their drug habits.  This seems cruel to many people, which is why homelessness has gotten worse. In other words, the reason homelessness has gotten worse is because we‚Äôve enabled it, and subsidized it, rather than funded treatment and recovery. Nobody has subsidized homelessness more than California, Washington, and Oregon. And it‚Äôs been in those states that homelessness has worsened the most.  Why? The homelessness groups really believe it‚Äôs more cruel to manPostingDate care than to let people die on the streets.  But there is an ideology behind this, too. It‚Äôs the idea that people suffering from addiction and mental illness are victims of society or the system, which is fundamentally evil. And, according to their logic, to restore justice in the world, we must give victims whatever they want, including the right to camp anywhere and use hard drugs, even if it results in their death.  You might call this \"pathological altruism. Think of the Kathy Bates character in Misery. Or of the mother who poisons her child in order to have a sick person to take care of, like in ‚ÄúSixth Sense.‚Äù  It‚Äôs no coincidence that the same people who believe this also think civilization is evil and should be replaced by something more akin to primitive anarchism, like the kind romanticized by intellectuals since Rousseau.  The alternative to this dystopia is tough love. We need to give people the care they need, but that‚Äôs not through enabling addiction and illegal behavior, but rather enforcing laws and mandating care, as an alternative to jail, when they are broken.  It‚Äôs not enough to do what many Republicans want to do, which is to enforce laws and recriminalize shoplifting and hard drugs simply. We need to do that, for sure.  But states must also have caseworkers, group homes, and psychiatric hospitals so there is an alternative to jail, and so states can provide people with the specialized care where it‚Äôs available, which simply isn‚Äôt going to be in many of the small towns, like the one at the center of the Supreme Court hearing.  The dirty little secret about homelessness, which is also the key to ending it, is...",

    "Content": "We Exposed Censorship By Brazil‚Äôs Supreme Court, And Now President Lula Is Persecuting Me    PLUS: Brazil‚Äôs Attorney General Is Seeking To Entirely Shut Down X, Formerly Known As Twitter   Thirty years ago this year, I asked Brazil‚Äôs current president, who goes by the single name ‚ÄúLula,‚Äù if he would turn his country into Cuba, complete with censorship. He said \"no\" and that he and the Brazilian people loved their freedom too much.    At no point since then did I ever imagine that I would be the victim of Cuba-style censorship and repression at the hands of @LulaOficial . And yet, that is precisely what is happening.    All of this is happening at the same time that Brazil‚Äôs Attorney General and Supreme Court are reportedly seeking a way to entirely shut down X, Brazil‚Äôs only free speech platform. The Brazilian government recently retaliated against X by cutting off advertising on X. X‚Äôs top attorney in Brazil resigned to protect his safety less than two weeks ago.    Yesterday, Brazil‚Äôs attorney general, Jorge Messias, urged the Supreme Court to pursue ‚Äúcriminal prosecution‚Äù and investigation to ‚Äúidentify and punish the possible culprits.‚Äù  My alleged crime was publishing the ‚ÄúTwitter Files - Brazil.‚Äù At no point does the Attorney General suggest that either I or my coauthors Eli Vieira and David √Ågape lied or presented inaccurate information in the Twitter Files - Brazil.    Rather, the Attorney General office‚Äôs six-page memo, released publicly, claims that I released ‚Äúexcerpts of content from confidential judicial decisions‚Äù in an ‚Äúattempt to destabilize the democratic state.‚Äù  This is untrue. None of the Twitter Files - Brazil contained ‚Äúconfidential judicial decisions.‚Äù The Twitter Files - Brazil were strictly emails between Twitter staff. There is not a single instance where we published ‚Äúconfidential judicial decisions.‚Äù    But even if we had, the Brazilian constitution says, ‚Äúthe law may only restrict the publicity of procedural acts when the defense of privacy or social interests so require\" (Article 5, LX).  In this case, it was imperative that we publish the Twitter Files precisely to protect the public‚Äôs right to privacy, freedom of speech, and democracy.   What‚Äôs more, the attack on me is highly selective. Brazilian news media have, for years, reported on confidential judiciary decisions and have not been subjected to such an outrageous criminal investigation as the one I am under.    Finally, there is no law against attempting to ‚Äúdestabilize the democratic state‚Äù through non-violent methods. The law only prohibits violent attacks on democracy. As such, the Attorney General abuses his powers and acts as a lawmaker, usurping Brazil‚Äôs Congress.    And just imagine if Brazil criminalized something as vague as ‚Äúdestabilizing the democratic state.‚Äù Such a law would allow President Lula to lock up nonviolent protesters, journalists, and his political rivals.  Why is the Attorney General doing this? The first thing to understand is",

      "Content": "For many years now, I have warned that the path that the West is taking will result in civil war.  It might take 5 years, 50 years, or 100 years but it is inevitable.  The West could have repeatedly resolved these issues peacefully but it refuses to auto-correct from its path of civilizational suicide.  Many Western men who are currently asleep at the wheel will wake up, and realize that they don\u0027t like being pushed around in their homelands; they don\u0027t like their women attacked; they don\u0027t like their freedoms curtailed; they don\u0027t like their faiths disrespected.  Once this happens, prepare for some gargantuan ugliness.  Those who think that they are gaining inroads in the West will soon find out that not all Western men are invertebrate castrati.  Save this tweet and never forget who warned you.",

This is massive. The Folha de S√£o Paulo is the newspaper of Brazil\u0027s elites and is very similar in many ways to the New York Times.  The Folha reports that its reporters interviewed \"politicians and judges\" across the three branches of government.  \"This perception has accumulated in recent months and has become more widespread after recent cases in Parliament and criticism of Moraes\u0027 decisions involving the blocking of pages on platform X (formerly Twitter). This last case involved businessman Elon Musk and members of the US Congress.\"  De Moraes is losing support in his seat of power.  \"Even within the Supreme Court, which usually supports his decisions by a large majority, there are ministers who express reservations about Moraes\u0027 actions, in private conversations.\"  Massive news!",

      "Content": "Brazilian Judge Pushes Nationalist Conspiracy Theory To Weaponize Federal Police Against Defenders Of Free Speech  Brazil‚Äôs Federal Police discuss me in new report commissioned by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes  Yesterday, a Brazilian Supreme Court Justice, who is also the President of the Superior Electoral Commission, lashed out angrily at X owner Elon Musk. At an event heavily promoted by Globo News, Alexandre de Moraes claimed that Musk is part of a vast extremist conspiracy to undermine Brazil‚Äôs sovereignty and democracy. He claimed that Musk was an ‚Äúirresponsible mercantilist‚Äù motivated solely by profits who had ‚Äúunited‚Äù with ‚Äúextremist Brazilian politicians.‚Äù  But there is no evidence of any conspiracy. Musk did not know I would publish the Twitter Files Brazil. Nor did the Brazilian politicians who reacted to them. And many of the politicians and journalists who de Moraes is demonizing as ‚Äúextremist‚Äù are advocates of freedom of speech, including the right to criticize de Moraes.  It‚Äôs true that some of the people who de Moraes is censoring have urged a military intervention and have made unsubstantiated claims about elections and Covid. I do not agree with many of the statements made by the people whom de Moraes has censored.  But freedom of speech means nothing if it does not protect people and ideas you disagree with. If we aren‚Äôt going to allow people to criticize democracy, elections, and vaccines, how will we ever know if they are bad? If people are spreading false information about democracy, elections, and vaccines, the best way to deal with the false information is with accurate information, not censorship.  The real extremist spreading disinformation here is de Moraes. If Musk were solely motivated by money, then he would not have stood up to de Moraes, which resulted in the Brazilian government halting all advertising on X, the resignation of X‚Äôs top lawyer in Brazil, who feared for his safety, and may result in de Moraes shutting down X in Brazil.  He is not simply demanding that social media platforms censor specific content by controversial journalists and politicians. He is demanding that all social media platforms ban them for life. He often does so through secret hearings without the right of appeal.  In fact, it‚Äôs all much worse than that. You can‚Äôt be a politician or journalist if you can‚Äôt communicate on social media. And so de Moraes is not just violating the Brazilian constitution‚Äôs protections of free speech, he is also attacking the freedom of the press, destroying careers, and interfering in elections.  De Moraes has acted unilaterally to invent entirely new laws. He is thus interfering and taking over the role of Congress and of the president. That means he is behaving like a dictator.  And now de Moraes has weaponized the Federal Police, including against me, for publishing the Twitter Files in Brazil. The Federal Police delivered two reports to de Moraes, one on April 18 and the other on April 19. The reports consist of a gigantic conspiracy theory, suggesting connections and relationships that simply do not exist.  The reports single me out and suggest it is somehow suspicious that I only have paid for one subscription on X, which is to Elon Musk. But there is nothing suspicious about this. I am paying Musk, not the other way around. And, as the Police report notes, Musk takes a percentage of the revenue of the people who subscribe to my content on X.  And the reports claim that people who de Moraes had demanded be censored had gained limited access to communicate on X, in particular through X‚Äôs Spaces, which allows for live conversation.  In other words, de Moraes is totally obsessed with silencing his enemies. It‚Äôs not enough for X to have blocked profiles. He also doesn‚Äôt want them to be able to use their voice.  It helps that the Brazilian government directly pays the Brazilian news media. The new Lula government increased government funding by 60% for Globo alone. Globo is the biggest media in Brazil. It has been demanding more censorship and running propaganda for de Moraes.  De Moraes is a brutish authoritarian. His censorship is as bad as the censorship imposed by Brazil‚Äôs military dictators. He is seeking, as a judge, to eliminate particularly politicians and journalists from public life.  This is hardly the first time de Moraes has weaponized the Federal Police. And in calling Elon Musk a foreign mercantilist, de Moraes is using the exact same kind of nationalist rhetoric that he has attacked his enemies for using.  Why does Moraes have so much power? In Brazil, people told me it was because de Moraes controls so many court cases involving rich and powerful people, including politicians and other judges.  The solution is for Brazil‚Äôs Congress to open an investigation, known as a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry (CPI). A CPI can evaluate judicial abuses of power, and that is obviously what is happening here. Under a CPI, Brazil‚Äôs Congress could gain access to communications between police and judges or anyone else.   A CPI could also hear from the victims of censorship. It could bring light to thousands of cases under secrecy. And it could discover how social media platforms were compelled to obey or collaborate with the regime.  Musk has taken extraordinary and historic actions to protect free speech. So, too has the US Congress. Now it‚Äôs time for Brazil‚Äôs Congress to act against the anti-democratic extremism of de Moraes. It must do so before the extremist de Moraes starts arresting his political enemies and shuts down X, and thus free speech, in Brazil.",

This upPostingDate also identifies 6% more Not Helpful notes, which in turn limits writing ability of authors regularly proposing such notes.  It works by identifying notes that contributors from a wide range of viewpoints agree are particularly low quality (for example, that they perceive as abuse or harassment) and then reducing Contributor Helpfulness Scores for raters that rate those notes as helpful. As a result, it gives more weight to contributors who consistently help identify notes that people find helpful.  Details and code: https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/pull/203",
