    "type": "Markets",
    "summary": "The tool has made over $5 million since going live in early March, with thousands of tokens issued daily.\nPump has generated significant revenue in a short period and zoomed to one of Solana\u0027s highest earning applications, showcasing the profitability of offering token creation services in the crypto space.\nThe platform allows users to create tokens with $2 and offers an inbuilt safety mechanism against scams like rug pulls, making it an attractive option for traders interested in meme coins.\n",
    "content": "Selling shovels in a gold rush was one of the surest ways to make profits, and it’s no different today in the digital asset world.\nPump, a meme coin generator platform, has earned over $5 million in fees since going live in March amid an ongoing meme coin frenzy on Solana, making it one of the biggest revenue-generating applications in a relatively short period.\nThe platform made $300,000 in the past 24 hours alone on Solana, data shows, contributing a significant chunk to the network’s total generated fees of $2.5 million. Annual revenue projections based on current usage and growth are about $66 million, DefiLlama data shows.\nPump lets anyone issue a token for $2 in capital, after which they choose the number of tokens, theme, and meme picture to accompany it. When the market capitalization of any token reaches $69,000, a portion of liquidity is deposited to the Solana-based exchange Raydium and burned. Last week, the platform also extended support to the Blast and Base networks.\nThe draw for traders is a supposed inbuilt safety mechanism: “Rug pulls,” a common crypto scam that sees token issuers drain liquidity, aren’t possible on Pump-issued tokens.\n“Pump prevents rugs by making sure that all created tokens are safe. Each coin on Pump is a fair launch with no pre-sale and no team allocation,” its site says.\nThe ease of usage means new tokens are created nearly every other second. CoinDesk calculated a total of 35 issuances in a one-minute period in Asian morning hours on Tuesday, although this figure is likely to wildly change based on timezones and interest in new types of memes.\nWhile there are likely tens of thousands of tokens that have been released on Pump since its March launch, only a few have reached market capitalizations of more than $10 million.\nThe largest tokens so far are Shark Cat (SC), a cat wearing a shark cap, and Hobbes, named after the cat of popular Solana trader Ansem, with valuations of $100 million and $35 million, respectively.\nCat memes are a popular draw for issuers, although popular Pump tokens range from a can of Arizona Iced Tea and Lord of the Rings character Gandalf to a pixelated image of a rubber duck.\n",

    "content": "Crypto trader Avi Eisenberg may testify at his criminal commodities fraud and manipulation trial, his defense team said Thursday. They have yet to make a final decision on the matter as the government\u0027s case nears its conclusion.\nThe 28-year old crypto trader could face as much as a 20-year prison sentence if the 15-person jury convicts him on all three counts stemming from his October 2022 trades on the DeFi trading platform Mango Markets, which netted him at least $110 million in various cryptocurrencies. The government seeks to portray that trade as an illegal windfall from market manipulation, while the defense calls it a legitimate trading strategy.\nProsecutors are nearing the end of their week-long case against Eisenberg. On Thursday, they called a special agent and an expert witness that walked the jury through how Eisenberg allegedly drove up the price of MNGO tokens on AscendX, FTX and Serum in order to inflate the value of perpetual contracts he was trading on the Mango Markets decentralized exchange. Then, they said, he borrowed or withdrew well over $100 million from the exchange.\nThe government\u0027s case against Eisenberg hasn\u0027t yet arrived at the aftermath of that trade, when Mango Markets founder Dafydd Durairaj negotiated the return of $67 million to the platform and in exchange promised not to seek charges against him. Prosecutors on Thursday told the court they were no longer planning to call Durairaj to the stand.\nThat turnabout complicated the defense\u0027s plan to question him under oath even though they have not yet served Durairaj a subpoena. Lead defense attorney Sanford Talkin asked Judge Arum Subramanian if the court could force Durairaj\u0027s counsel Rafael Yakobi to accept a subpoena on his client\u0027s behalf.\nRead more: DeFi Trader Eisenberg \u0027Wasn\u0027t Borrowing, He Was Stealing,\u0027 Prosecutor Says in Opening Argument\n",

The SEC must make final decisions on some of the ETF applications by May 23. The SEC approved spot bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January, stirring speculation in some quarters that versions for ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain, may follow suit.\n“If there is no spot ether ETF approval in May, then we assume there is going to be litigation against the SEC after May,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.\nJPMorgan said the most likely outcome is that the SEC will eventually lose this litigation, similar to what happened in the Grayscale and Ripple cases, and will eventually approve spot ether ETFs. But not in May.\nOne reason the SEC is likely to lose any litigation is because of the declining concentration in staking on Ethereum, raising the chance that ether will avoid being designated as a security, the report said.\nThe bank noted in a report last week that Lido’s share of staked ether has continued to fall, which should reduce concerns about concentration in the network.

Still, one observer does not favor placing bullish bets on volatility.\n\"From a qualitative perspective, I continue to believe paying a volatility premium for a highly predictable outcome (the BTC halving) isn\u0027t worth a volatility event premium,\" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a newsletter on Monday.\nTraders typically place bullish bets on volatility ahead of binary events, for which the market outcome is uncertain. Moreover, uncertainty opens the door to pre- and post-event price turbulence and has traders buying both call and put options or volatility futures to profit from any price swings.\nBut the impact of Bitcoin\u0027s reward halving on its native cryptocurrency and miners has been well documented.

    "content": "\"IBIT is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs,\" Blackrock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink recently declared in an interview with Fox Business. The SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January and subsequent performance has driven BTC and the broader crypto market to new heights.\nFirst, Bitcoin itself has made a new “all-time-high,” as prices broke past $70,000. U.S. based CME futures contracts for Bitcoin surpassed the open interest of all other exchanges, including Binance, to become the largest BTC derivatives venue. And, finally, the futures basis reached over 25% annualized, nearly five-times the U.S. risk-free rates.\nYou\u0027re reading Crypto Long \u0026 Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\nWhere does that leave us today?\nBitcoin has one more major fundamental milestone that’s keeping traders and investors excited for higher prices, and that’s the Bitcoin halving. Scheduled to occur around April 20 (the perfect meme, of course) the Bitcoin block issuance rate will drop from 6.25 coins per block, to 3.125.\nAlthough a small sample size, the past years in which Bitcoin had a halving event, the Jan to Dec performance averaged about 200%. This would imply an end-of-year price for BTC of about $91,500.\nThat said, from a derivatives trading perspective, the predictability and certainty around halving isn’t like the uncertainty of an SEC spot ETF decision and the subsequent ETF adoption. That means that traders aren’t likely to be surprised by a completely known event. Given this understanding, using Bitcoin derivatives as a contrast to Ethereum tells us a story around the potential opportunity for a post-halving rotation.\nLooking at the April 26 option expiration (top) versus the June 28 expiration (bottom), we can clearly see the dynamics being priced into both Bitcoin and Ethereum options. Firstly, for April 26, Bitcoin options on the call wing are priced at a substantial premium to the Ethereum call wing, while the Ethereum put wing is priced at a premium to the BTC put wing.\nLonger-dated options for June 28 are nearly identically overlaid, showing a tight relationship between BTC and ETH to be regular in the longer term.\nRead More: Did Strong Bitcoin ETF Demand Kill Halving\u0027s Potential Bullish Rally?\nWhat this tells me is that the current halving narrative is being priced into short-term BTC options, while at the same time, the lack of optimism around Ethereum due to a potential “securities” designation from the SEC and likely disapproval for a spot ETF in May are causing traders to bid for Ethereum puts.\nSomething else I’d like to point out is the differential in CME-led positioning between BTC and ETH.\nLooking at the top chart for BTC derivatives positioning we can see that CME futures (in green) really started in earnest in October around the enthusiasm for a spot ETF approval. Today, CME BTC open interest dwarfs any other exchange, including Binance.\nIf we look at Ethereum CME open interest, we see nearly no increases while Binance continues to exceed CME open interest by a large margin. This tells me that the US market has yet to begin building up positions in Ethereum; and should we move towards a spot ETF for Ethereum, whether in May or much later (after initial rejections), buyers haven’t crowded Ethereum yet.\nSo why should we even care about this opportunity to buy the laggard Ethereum?\nWhile the market is excited about the BTC halving slowing down the issuance rate for coins into circulation, (clearly displayed through 4/26 options) the ETH supply has not only already stopped growing, but since September 2022, is actively decreasing, due to EIP-1559 burns.\nEthereum has also just successfully completed the Dencun upgrade, as L2s and L3s begin to facilitate RWA, DeFi and NFT growth, along with the ability to build native “app-chains” for high throughput protocols that want to isolate activity within their own environment.\nNo one knows for sure what the future holds, and investing is peppered with risk. But a general axiom that I like is whether the fundamentals are already priced-in, or is the market under-invested in a potential opportunity?\nIn my mind, after halving, the BTC events will be behind us, and instead of merely “selling the news,” we can “rotate into the alts” in this case, specifically Ethereum.\n",

His companies filed for bankruptcy the year prior.\nEarlier this month, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for his role in the collapse of the exchange, along with 3 years of supervised release and $11 billion in forfeiture.\nNew York District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan said Bankman-Fried was not remorseful for his crimes, and called his altruistic persona an “act.” Kaplan said that the sentence – which was much lower than the 40-50 year sentence requested by federal prosecutors but higher than the 6.5 year sentence Bankman-Fried’s legal team suggested – was necessary in order to ensure Bankman-Fried was unable to commit similar crimes in the future.\nThough Kaplan ordered Bankman-Fried be remanded to a low or medium-security prison near his parents in Northern California, citing his autism as a risk factor for him in a maximum security facility, Bankman-Fried has surprisingly asked to be kept in the notorious Manhattan Detention Center during his appeal process.\nBankman-Fried’s former colleagues and co-conspirators – several of whom turned over evidence on him and testified at his trial – have yet to be sentenced for their roles in the fraud.\nBankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas in November 2022, shortly after FTX and Alameda – alongside affiliates worldwide – filed for bankruptcy, following the publication of a CoinDesk article revealing oddities in its balance sheet.\nFederal prosecutors said he deliberately stole customer and investor funds, and lied about what the funds would go toward, during his trial last October.\nUPDATE (April 11, 2024, 16:36 UTC): Adds additional detail.\nRead all of CoinDesk\u0027s coverage here.\n",

The pre-seed-stage startup is building an implementation and wallet for Bitcoin\u0027s layer-2 Lightning network on top of Urbit, an open-source software project that attempts to rewrite the entire internet computing stack from first principles.\nFlashback to 2022: Urbit Is Web3, Weird and Wonderful and I Don’t Care Who Made It\nAsked how much he expected the memento – scribbled at a time when bitcoin (BTC) traded around $2,400 – to fetch, Langalis said, \"I try not to think about it.\" However, he said that in recent weeks he received a private offer to buy the sign for five BTC, roughly $350,000 at recent prices. There is no reserve bid, or minimum price, he said.\nBidding for the sign will commence on April 18 and run for a week on Scarce City, but final bids will be entertained in person on April 24 at PubKey, a bitcoin-themed dive bar in New York (where a replica of the sign hangs on the wall). \"It\u0027s a way to celebrate with the community,\" Langalis said.\nRead more: How PubKey Revived Bitcoin Culture in New York City\nThe image of Langalis behind Yellen (who is now the U.S. Treasury Secretary and lukewarm at best about crypto) drew international attention to bitcoin. After pulling the stunt, he was escorted out of the House Financial Services hearing room for violating committee rules, he said. By that time, the image was being widely shared on social media, although he didn\u0027t know it yet.\n\"I was clueless,\" he said in a text message. \"Phone dead since I arrived [at the hearing] so early.\"\nUPDATE (April 11, 16:16 UTC): Adds link to third paragraph.\n",

What\u0027s clear is that blockchain tech enables all sorts of monetary strategies.\nIn this week\u0027s issue:\nSide-by-side charts showing impact of the proposal to adopt a new Ethereum issuance curve. (Ansgar Dietrichs and Caspar Schwarz-Schilling/Ethereum Magicians Forum)\nSOUNDER MONEY? Earlier this year, a pair of Ethereum Foundation (EF) researchers put forth a proposal to reduce the pace of new issuance of ether (ETH) tokens. It was part of a concerted plan to reduce incentives for new stakers – the investors who lock cryptocurrency into the blockchain as a way of helping to secure the network. The freshly minted ETH is a crucial component of the rewards these investors hope to receive, in the form of staking yields. As the researchers\u0027 thinking went, there\u0027s already enough stakers to provide effective security for the blockchain, and in fact any additional increases in the level of participation could enable the unwanted dominance of fast-growing third-party staking platforms like Lido. A side benefit of the proposed change would be to harden ether as a form of money, since the total supply of the cryptocurrency wouldn\u0027t grow as quickly – effectively tapering ether\u0027s inflation rate. The current issuance rate \"dilutes ETH holders beyond what is necessary for security,\" the researchers wrote. They estimated that the proposal would reduce ETH staking yields by nearly a third. Now, though, some members of the community are pushing back, as reported by CoinDesk\u0027s Margaux Nijkerk. There are questions over whether there\u0027s really a need to change the tokenomics of ether and, in the extreme, whether the Ethereum Foundation plays an outsize role in influencing code upgrades on the decentralized network. Viktor Bunin, a protocol specialist at Coinbase Cloud, wrote on the social-media platform X, “If it\u0027s not broke don\u0027t fix it.”\nMEME COIN GENERATOR GO BRRR… In last week\u0027s The Protocol, we made the point that blockchain teams have, generally speaking, succeeded in coopting the über-power of printing one\u0027s own money, long reserved for governments and banks. An integral element of the process are the various \"launchpads\" that teams use to spin up their new tokens. In an article this week, CoinDesk\u0027s Shaurya Malwa highlighted a project called Pump, which in the short period since going live last month has already earned $5 million in fees – partly due to the meme coin frenzy on the Solana blockchain. \"Selling shovels in a gold rush was one of the surest ways to make profits, and it’s no different today in the digital asset world,\" Malwa wrote. \"While there are likely tens of thousands of tokens that have been released on Pump since its March launch, only a few have reached market capitalizations of more than $10 million. The largest tokens so far are Shark Cat (SC), a cat wearing a shark cap, and Hobbes, named after the cat of popular Solana trader Ansem, with valuations of $100 million and $35 million, respectively,\" according to Malwa. Even so, Pump is on track to reap about $66 million of annual revenue, based on current usage and growth, DefiLlama data shows. Whether this token-generation business is legal, or approved by securities regulators, may depend on the circumstances, or the terms of use, or on the jurisdiction. But in the meantime investment bankers who used to lead elaborate offerings in exchange for Wall-Street-size fees (and Lambo-scale bonuses) are basically being replaced by apps.\nEU vs. MEV. The European Union markets regulator flagged maximum extractable value (MEV), whereby blockchain operators reorder user transactions to maximize their own profits, as a potential form of market abuse, a stance that is worrying some industry watchers who say the case is not clear-cut, CoinDesk\u0027s Sandali Handagama reports. “MEV by itself should not at all be considered as a market abuse and should not have a negative connotation,\" Anja Blaj, a policy expert at the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI), told Handagama in an interview over WhatsApp.\nBITCOIN HALVING FACTOID: On average, it has taken about 57 days after a Bitcoin halving for the network hashrate to recover to its pre-halving hashrate. (This is for the three halvings that have taken place since Satoshi Nakamoto launched the original blockchain in 2009. Bitcoin\u0027s fourth halving is estimated to arrive next week, coincidentally and yet characteristically on the very meme-y date of April 20.) (Go here for a roundup of CoinDesk\u0027s coverage on the upcoming halving.)\nEigenLayer, the restaking protocol atop Ethereum that has shot to the top of the DeFi rankings with more than $12 billion of user deposits, launched on mainnet.\nChristie\u0027s auction house, famous for its $69 million sale in 2021 for the NFT artist Beeple\u0027s \"Everydays\" collage, is now following rival Sotheby\u0027s into the market for Ordinals inscriptions, colloquially known as Bitcoin NFTs.\nExcerpt from Christie\u0027s press release about the Ordinals inscriptions auction planned for April 9-16.

And right now, from a defensive standpoint, the bulwark looks pretty formidable. As highlighted in a recent report by Coinbase Institutional analysts David Han and David Duong, Ethereum \"currently holds a tremendous economic foundation for securing its network from a hostile majority attack.\" The evaluation comes from comparing the total amount of ETH staked on Ethereum to the network\u0027s \"total value locked\" (TVL), roughly representing DeFi deposits that are being protected.\n(Coinbase Institutional)\n",

But did you know that just one and a half years ago, one of its co-founders was presenting his startup idea at an EasyA hackathon at Harvard?\nThe EasyA Consensus Hackathon takes place during CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus festival May 29-31, in Austin, Texas.\nDevin is not the only project that’s raised millions from VCs having come out of an EasyA hackathon. Projects launched by EasyA alumni have been funded by a16z, YC, Founders Fund and tons of other world-class VCs. The path from learning about a blockchain on EasyA to competing at a hackathon and then raising millions of dollars in VC funding is one that is well-trodden by the EasyA community.\nSo well-trodden, in fact, that startups launched by EasyA hackathon winners are now valued at almost $500m. Yes, that’s almost half a billion!\nAnd while $500 million is already an astronomical number, we want to bring it up to $1 billion. That’s why we made the decision to partner with CoinDesk this year, to bring the first ever in-person hackathon to Consensus. Running directly alongside the conference itself, at the exact same venue in Austin, we’re inviting the top 500 builders from across the world to hack at this inaugural hackathon. Accepted hackers will not only get a chance to pitch at 2024’s biggest hackathon of the year, but also a free Consensus ticket!\nHere are three reasons startups should consider participating this year.\nIf you’re an aspiring founder looking to launch the next Web3 unicorn, funding is probably the number one thing you’re looking to secure. Together with CoinDesk, we’re bringing a ton of exciting funding opportunities to Consensus, more than you can even apply for. From hundreds of thousands of dollars in bounties to hundreds of millions more in equity-free grants and VC funding, there’s literally no better place to launch your project.\nOver 15,000 blockchain professionals and pioneers will flood Consensus this year, making it the perfect place for you to launch your idea with an immediate captive audience. We’re even giving hackathon finalists the chance to present their pitches on stage at the main Consensus conference itself, meaning you’ll get to meet and pitch VCs in the crowd. It’s literally the perfect launchpad to take your idea to the moon!\nThe world’s best investors and founders attend Consensus each year. Getting accepted to the EasyA Consensus hackathon doesn’t just give you the chance of a lifetime to pitch your blockchain project on-stage at Consensus, but it also gives you a free pass to the main Consensus Conference itself, where speakers from a16z’s Chris Dixon to Solana’s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko will be presenting live on stage.\nWe’re about to start hosting Twitter spaces with each of our sponsors where we’ll be dropping alpha on what to expect from each hackathon track, bounties and how you can get ready to win! So make sure you’re following our Twitter account to stay up-to-date on important updates as we approach hackathon week.\nMake sure you sign up for the hackathon right now. Spaces are limited and once they’re gone, they’re gone.\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Austin and cannot wait to see what you build!\n",

    "content": "Ethereum developers, fresh off the successful Dencun upgrade, which enabled a major change to make it cheaper to transact on layer-2 blockchains, are moving ahead in planning the blockchain\u0027s next improvements.\nThe contents of the next upgrade, \"Pectra,\" are nowhere near finalized, but developers have previously said their aim with the upgrade will be to ship it while simultaneously working on the chain\u0027s next upgrade.\n“The idea with Pectra is to try and find a bunch of small wins that we can get relatively quickly while we prototype the larger stuff,” Tim Beiko, protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk in an interview on The Protocol podcast\nAttendees at Thursday\u0027s Etheruem All Core Developers call – a bi-weekly meeting of the blockchain\u0027s primary developers – signaled that Pectra is likely to include Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3074, a proposed set of code changes for improving the user experience (UX) of Ethereum wallets. Specifically, the proposal will allow users to batch transactions and sign off on them all at once.\nAnother one of the main changes likely to occur in Pectra will be a lift to the staking limit for validators, from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH – a 64-fold increase. That proposal, known as EIP 7251, would allow large staking providers, like Coinbase or Lido, to consolidate their validators operating the Ethereum blockchain – while allowing them to avoid constantly creating new validators every time they have another 32 ETH to stake.\nAccording to Dune Analytics, over 1 million validators are currently operating the Ethereum network, which has led to concern over excessive latency. Developers have been looking for ways to slow the rate at which new validators enter the system – potentially bogging it down. EIP 2751 is pitched as a way to lighten the operational load for larger stakers, consolidate the number of validators on the blockchain, and allow staking providers to deploy less resources to staking and validating.\nThe name \"Pectra\" is a portmanteau of two simultaneous upgrades happening on the different layers of the blockchain. The execution layer, where protocol rules are enforced, will undergo the \"Prague\" upgrade, and the consensus layer, which ensures that blocks are validated, will go through the \"Electra\" upgrade.\nEthereum developers are known for Brangelina-ing their upgrades, like the previous one where the simultaneous Deneb and Cancun upgrades were referred to as “Dencun,” (and “Shapella” prior to that.) The Ethereum naming convention follows the different cities that Devcon took place in for the execution layer, and for the consensus layer, it follows an alphabetical order of the name of stars.\nOther EIPs for consideration include triggering validator withdrawals from smart contracts, adding a code change known as BLS precompile, and removing the deposit window. These are relatively small changes to the network for the developers to work on.\nThe upgrade following Pectra will include long-awaited \"verkle trees\" – a new type of data system designed to help Ethereum nodes store large amounts of data.\nBeiko said developers would aim to push Pectra out sometime at the end of 2024, maybe early 2025. “It\u0027s going to be a relatively small upgrade. The reason for that is that it allows us to work on two forks in parallel. We are working on Verkle trees and that transition,” Beiko said. “We are working on that but it\u0027s going to take more than a year. So in the meantime we have bandwidth to work on other small wins.”\nRead more: Ethereum Finalizes \u0027Dencun\u0027 Upgrade, in Landmark Move to Reduce Data Fees\n",

    "content": "Data provider Chainlink (LINK) unveiled Thursday its blockchain bridge application called \"Transporter,\" which allows users to move crypto assets and data across multiple networks.\nChainlink\u0027s bridge is available for both individual users and institutions and aims to allow \"a cost-efficient way to make high-value token transfers across blockchains with peace of mind,\" a Chainlink spokesperson explained in an interview on Telegram.\nThe first available blockchains for Transporter are Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and WEMIX, the press release said.\nThe release marks the entrance of the crypto world\u0027s key software platform that connects blockchain rails with external data – or oracle service – to the fast-growing sector of blockchain bridges. As the digital asset economy mushrooms, bridges serve a crucial role in connecting the ever-increasing number of individual blockchain rails, allowing the transfer of value and data between them. Existing bridges transferred some $12 billion worth of assets across chains through last month, DefiLlama data shows. However, bridges often are targets of exploits and hacks, carrying risks of losses for users.\nRead more: What Are Blockchain Bridges and How Do They Work?\n\"Having a secure way to move both value and data across chains is something the blockchain industry has needed for years,\" Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a statement. \"Transporter makes it easier to utilize the security benefits of Chainlink\u0027s CCIP for the transfer of large token value and critical messages across chains.\"\nTransporter was built on top of Chainlink\u0027s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), a piece of tech that has been a key component behind Chainlink\u0027s partnership with SWIFT, a closed network used by banks to make international money transfers.\nThe platform also offers global support and a real-time visual tracker to follow the status of transfer between chains. It charges the regular fee of using CCIP, which covers the cost of executing the transaction on the destination blockchain and the fees paid to CCIP service providers.\n\"I expect that Transporter will quickly establish itself as the standard for cross-chain enablement for high-value use cases,” said Nomatic, an investor at venture capital firm Fourth Revolution Capital, which was one of the early users of the bridge.\n",

    "title": "BlockFi’s Rise and Fall: A Timeline",
    "type": "Learn",
    "summary": "BlockFi, a crypto lending company, was founded in October 2017 and filed for bankruptcy just over five years later in the wake of FTX\u0027s collapse.\n",
    "content": "Crypto lender BlockFi is kaput. The platform, which offered high yields on crypto deposits, has filed for bankruptcy protection. It’s the latest company to fall after the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Indeed, bankruptcy filings show that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. But how did it all go so wrong? CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture.\nZac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company’s chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral.\nVenture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer.\nFlush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it \"doesn’t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.” As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn’t seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company.\nThe firm’s next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts.\nIn December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood’s business model. “Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,” BlockFi’s CEO said.\nPeter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led BlockFi’s $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping “BlockFi expand into Singapore” and the Asia-Pacific region.\nBlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to “crypto payment rails” such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren\u0027t already cryptocurrency owners.” The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform.\nAll was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee’s phone with a “SIM swap” that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee’s phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi’s retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi’s customers.\nIn August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors.\nIn October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk\u0027s parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020.\nBlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin.\nEarly in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale’s product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\nAll was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin’s soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong?\nNew Jersey’s Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state’s financial regulator claimed BlockFi’s interest accounts amounted to sales of an “unregistered security” and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers.\nThe CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that – and it didn’t end well for BlockFi (we’ll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card.\nIn February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. “Today’s settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.\nIn June, BlockFi’s valuation sank to $1 billion in a “down round” – a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund\u0027s collateral before its bankruptcy. In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi’s main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection.\nIn dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren’t met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S.\nAt the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11.\nThat was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX’s credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid “the lack of clarity” about FTX. On Nov. 11, California’s financial regulator revoked BlockFi’s lending license.\nBlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried\u0027s Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan.\nIn the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX. All the while, one question looms: Will customers get anything back?\nRead More: Latest BlockFi Stories\n",

    "content": "Craig Wright has dropped his appeal against Norwegian bitcoiner Hodlonaut, ending a nearly five-year-long legal battle over a series of social media posts in which Hodlonaut called Wright a “scammer” and a “fraud” for claiming to be the inventor of Bitcoin.\nA Norwegian judge sided with Hodlonaut after a 2022 trial in Oslo, concluding that he had “sufficient factual grounds to claim that Wright had lied and cheated in his attempt to prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.” Hodlonaut brought the case against Wright to preempt him from moving forward with a defamation case about the same social media posts in the U.K., where laws are heavily tipped in favor of the plaintiff, and monetary damages can be enormous.\nThe infamously litigious Wright appealed the court’s decision. But, according to Hodlonaut, Wright has now dropped that appeal.\n“Just got off the phone with my Norwegian lawyer. CRAIG WRIGHT DROPPED THE APPEAL IN NORWAY!,” Hodlonaut wrote in a social media post, adding, “I’m very happy!”\nWright’s decision to back down comes just a month after he lost a separate court case in the U.K. that severely hobbled his ability to claim Satoshi’s throne. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) sued Wright in 2021 in order to prove that he was not, in fact, the inventor of Bitcoin and to stop him from being able to claim copyright of the Bitcoin whitepaper or sue Bitcoin developers or others under the guise of being Satoshi.\nIn March, U.K. Judge James Mellor found in favor of COPA, stating that Wright “is not the author of the Bitcoin white paper…is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto….is not the person who created the Bitcoin System…[and] is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software.”\nThe famously bellicose Wright has been largely quiet in the wake of Judge Mellor’s decision, as has his billionaire benefactor Calvin Ayre. The day after the COPA trial ended, Ayre posted a farewell message on X, saying that the message would be his “last” before taking off on “an adventure I have planned for the last year.”\nDespite the conclusion of Wright’s appeal in Norway, other litigation involving Wright – including another defamation case against Hodlonaut in the U.K. – remains pending.\nRepresentatives for Wright did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.\n",

    "type": "Learn",
    "summary": "Recently released emails from former SEC director William Hinman have rallied the XRP troops, but the documents are not a smoking gun.\n",
    "content": "On June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC\u0027s lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case.\nHere’s why:\nVery broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly.\nRipple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators.\nEarly analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails’ release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front.\nAhead of the documents’ release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn’t a security if it is “sufficiently decentralized.” That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is “sufficiently decentralized” and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman.\nCritics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token – and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security.\nRipple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called “Ripple” even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders “gifted” 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as “Ripple.”\nRead More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency?\nTo critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of “decentralization theater.” And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures.\nIn any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple\u0027s side of the case, XRP\u0027s price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.\nSee Also: Ripple Does Not Care Whether XRP Is “Sufficiently Decentralized”\n",

    "content": "Money is flowing back into social application Friend.Tech as a new version teases an eventual airdrop, bringing users back to what was among the biggest revenue-generating platforms during the bear market.\nOver $7 million flowed to Friend.Tech last week after months of outflows, boosting the value locked to nearly $40 million, data shows. Weekly fees have crossed $1.3 million for the first time since November, making the platform over $600,000 in revenue.\nBuilt on Base, a layer-2 network, Friend.Tech lets crypto personalities on X issue “shares” for access to a closed group chat. For users, the allure of these chats is that their owners could offer trading insights, token picks or access to seed-funding deals – which raises the value of the shares.\nThe bump in activity precedes the coming of version 2 of the application, which developers said will be released after April 20. A key element of the update is expanding the platform beyond X to attract newer users.\nOver the weekend, developers also teased a FRIEND token. Expectations among users are that these could be distributed based on how many points – a reward for Friend.Tech usage – they accumulate before the token release.\nFriend.tech was earning in excess of $1 million per day in fees at its August peak after going viral on X and gaining more than 100,000 unique users, a significant number for crypto application standards. Shares of some crypto X personalities, such as @Cobie and @HsakaTrades, jumped to as much as three ether, or nearly $5,000, at the time.\nActivity fell off in the months following as the initial allure wore off. Security risks later marred the platform alongside opportunities elsewhere in the sector, leading to months of outflows since November.\n",

    "summary": "\"A lot of things can go wrong,\" in  Ethena\u0027s yield-generation strategy, said Folkvang CEO Mike van Rossum.\nEthena Labs\u0027 USDe stablecoin provides a yield through a tokenized cash-and-carry trade.\nCounterparty risk and a funding-rates reversal are two of the protocol\u0027s main challenges.\nEthena founder Guy Young labeled comparisons with Terra\u0027s failed UST as a \"weak, surface-level argument.\"\n",
    "content": "Ethena Labs, a decentralized protocol centered on the yield-bearing USDe stablecoin, has polarized crypto traders in the weeks since introducing the token to the public in February over similarities to the Terra ecosystem, which imploded in 2021.\nPeople who stake USDe for a minimum of seven days currently earn an annualized yield of about 37%, high enough to spur total value locked (TVL) on the protocol to $2.3 billion from $178 million – a 12-fold increase in just 60 days. High yield, however, is a double-edged sword and usually reflects high risk: Terra\u0027s UST paid out nearly 20% to stakers before its demise.\nUnlike asset-backed stablecoins like tether (USDT) and USDC, whose value is secured against dollars or dollar-equivalents such as U.S. government debt, USDe calls itself a synthetic stablecoin with its $1 value maintained through a financial technique known as the cash-and-carry trade. The trade, which involves buying an asset and simultaneously shorting a derivative of the asset to collect the funding rate, or the difference between the two prices, is well known in traditional finance and doesn\u0027t carry directional, or delta, risk.\n\"The trade itself is very safe and well understood, many folks (including Folkvang) have been running trades like this for years,\" Folkvang founder Mike van Rossum said in a post on X. \"But keep in mind it’s only risk free when talking about delta. There are a lot of things that can go wrong here. Such as any issue with any of the exchanges these positions (and collateral) are managed on. As well as issues around trying to execute hundreds of millions (or billions) in very volatile markets.\"\nEthena users mint USDe tokens by depositing stablecoins like USDT, dai (DAI) and USDC on the protocol. They can then stake the minted USDe, which has a market cap of $21.3 billion, in return for the yield.\nTo generate that yield, Ethena has deployed several strategies that hinge around the cash-and-carry trade.\nFunding rates on bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) perpetuals are currently positive, which means long positions pay short positions, generating a return for those shorting the market. Funding rates typically flip negative in falling markets, which means Ethena\u0027s yield source might dry up if cryptocurrency enters another bearish cycle.\nCrypto whales seem unperturbed. Earlier this week 10 wallets withdrew a total of $51 million of Ethena\u0027s native governance token (ENA) from exchanges and locked that on Ethena for a minimum of seven days, according to Lookonchain.\n\"The risks to Ethena is that the yield goes away due to natural market forces, or that they have a counterparty blow up, not the collateral itself,\" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, said in an interview.\n\"What Ethena is trying to do with basis trades is fairly easy, and has been done in traditional markets for decades,\" he said. \"Anyone can do the same thing on their own, if they have enough capital for collateral, and trusted counterparties. All Ethena is doing is increasing the risk while decreasing the time it takes for you to do it on your own.\"\nTerra\u0027s traumatic demise led to the bankruptcy of several other crypto firms, and left long-lasting scars across the industry. It blew up because UST, an algorithmic stablecoin, entered a death spiral following aggressive selling and a slump in the value of LUNA, which acted as collateral.\n\"It is a really weak, surface-level argument to compare what Ethena is doing to Luna,\" Ethena Labs founder Guy Young said in an interview with Laura Shin on the Unchained podcast. \"The core difference here is thinking about what\u0027s backing the stable asset. So UST was backed by the LUNA token, which mooned up 100% and dumped 50% in a week. Ethena\u0027s USD is fully backed and fully collateralized.\"\nAs for its reliance on a bull market, Young said: \"I think it\u0027s a valid concern around this. What we did see even in 2022 when you had staked ETH together with basis you could still sustain rates above U.S. Treasuries, but I do imagine that in a bear market you do see a reasonable unwind of USDe supply.\"\n\"This is something that we\u0027re okay with,\" Young said. \"It\u0027s just something that is responding to market dynamics, and if there is less leverage demand to be long as the interest rate is lower, we\u0027re going to adjust to a smaller size.\"\nYoung didn\u0027t rule out changing Ethena\u0027s yield-generation strategy to something that \"makes sense in a bear market\" if necessary.\n",

    "content": "CoinDesk’s Consensus has seen plenty of heated blockchain battles over its ten year history. But 2024’s matchup in the Karate Combat Pit takes the dueling to a new level.\nCrypto influencers Nic Carter and David Hoffman are set to go toe-to-toe on May 30 during this year’s conference in Austin, Texas. “Influencer Fight Club 2” is the part of the increasingly popular Karate Combat series, essentially a no-holds-barred version of UFC without the (time-wasting) on-mat grappling. Carter, co-founder of data analytics leader Coin Metrics and VC fund Castle Island Ventures, will represent Bitcoin, while Hoffman, the founder of media platform Bankless, will fly the colors for Ethereum. The bout is two rounds of two minutes each, with a third round scheduled if a tiebreaker is needed.\nAlso on the card is Billy McFarland, the infamous Fyre Festival entrepreneur, who squares off against Alex, better known by his handle @shillin_villain.\n“I’m very confident,” said Carter, via X DMs. “I’ve never trained in martial arts before this and I don’t think David has either. But we are both very fitness focused – which makes us a good matchup.” Both fighters have hired trainers to work on basic fighting skills and they’re preparing hard around other day-to-day commitments.\nThe friends have a side bet where they’ll donate $10,000 to the winner’s chosen open-source development group. Carter’s choice is the Bitcoin Core, which maintains the Bitcoin network. Hoffman’s is Protocol Guild, the equivalent organization in the Ethereum community.\nWhen the news leaked on X last week, several commenters made fun of the fighters’ physiques and mocked their fighting skills. But the two are undeterred. “At the end of the day, it’s me and David that are taking the risk and getting in the ring and all they can do is watch,” Carter said. “If they want to fight they can try and get in the undercard, they are welcome to reach out to Karate Combat. But David and I aren’t claiming to be amazing fighters. The objective is to entertain and take on a new challenge, not to begin decorated fight careers.” “It’s been funny to hear all the haters who want to fight us,” adds Hoffman. “I have no interest in fighting anyone but Nic Carter.” This is the 46th Karate Combat event and the second under the banner “Influencer Fight Club (IFC).” The first, featuring Ben “BitBoy” Armstrong and meme coin creator “More Light,” in Mexico City in February, drew hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. BitBoy beat the more-fancied More Light in a match full of aggression and flanging fists and arms.\nKarate Combat founder ONLYLARPING said he wants the format to “be the first official sport of Web3.” “It makes sense to partner with the biggest and best conferences in the world and the most entertaining influencers and founders.”\nResearch by Karate Combat found that a large percentage of its audience don’t enjoy sports unless there is a side-bet element to it. The platform has a no-loss gaming feature, where Karate token-holders plump for a winner and are given a small share of the prize money if they pick the right horse. If they pick the loser, they don’t give up anything.\nThe Karate Combat series at Consensus features six influencer fights and 10 more conventional bouts involving professional fighters. The action begins May 30 at 7 pm local time. Weigh-ins take place May 29 at 5 pm on the Town Square stage.\n",

    "summary": "The halving, due on April 20, will reduce the per-block bitcoin emission to 3.12 BTC from 6.25 BTC, slowing the pace of supply expansion by 50%.\nBitcoin options show expectations for pre-halving price weakness and a bullish bias following the pivotal quadrennial event.\nThe long-term outlook depends more on macro factors than halving, analysts said.\nOptions market shows expectations for a price rally into six figures by December.\n",
    "content": "The bitcoin (BTC) options market, historically a reliable indicator of sentiment, is showing investors expect weakness in the run-up to the mining-reward halving due April 20 followed by a rally after the event, which reduces the pace of new bitcoin creation by cutting the per-block coin emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.\nThe world\u0027s largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading about $71,000. Put options at strike prices of $61,000 and $60,000 listed on derivatives exchange Deribit have the highest build-up, respectively, of open interest among options expiring a week before and a day before halving, according to data tracked by Amberdata.\nPut options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at the specified price at a later date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, looking to profit from or hedge against a price slide. Open interest refers to the number of active or open contracts at a given time.\nThe chart shows open interest distribution in options expiring on April 19, a day before halving is expected. At press time, open interest in the $60,000 put was 1,000 contracts or $70.90 million, the highest in the expiry. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC.\nThe temporary pre-halving nervousness is consistent with analysts\u0027 view that prices may wobble around the halving time.\nMeanwhile, open interest in options expiring on April 26 – about a week after the halving – was more evenly distributed, with calls or bullish bets at $70,000 and $80,000 more popular than others. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.\n\"Right ahead of the halving, you have notable open interest in the $60,000 put expiring a day before the event, whereas month-end is a bit more spread out,\" Simranjeet Singh, a trader at the crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk. \"I guess some traders may want to fade the move in the short term, similar to the ETF event, until we reach a nice consolidation level for another leg higher.\"\nSingh said the next leg higher partly depends on the U.S. interest-rate outlook and political developments.\nBitcoin saw a brief drop to $67,600 on Wednesday after hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data saw traders push back the timing of the first Fed rate cut to November from June. The losses were short-lived, with prices rebounding early Thursday as the rate cut remains on the table, though delayed.\n\"The newly found \u0027Fed put\u0027 remains in place though, with the Fed focused on both risks to inflation and employment, rather than on inflation alone,\" trader and analyst Alex Kruger said on X. The \"Fed put\" is a notion that the central bank will come to the rescue if the economy or markets falter.\nTrader Christopher Newhouse said bitcoin options expiring after May will be affected more by the macroeconomic environment and organic demand than the halving.\nThe large concentration of open interest in the $100,000 December expiry and the $200,000 March 2025 expiry calls shows expectations that macro factors would continue to act as a tailwind.\nAs of writing, the December expiry call at $100,000 had a notional open interest of $226 million, while the open interest in the March expiry call at $200,000 was $70.7 million.\n",

    "type": "Learn",
    "summary": "More people are calling for crypto companies and those behind products such as stablecoins to prove they have enough funds to pay their customers.\n",
    "content": "Regular banks do not actually hold all of your money. They lend out most of your deposits in an attempt to eke out returns from financial markets. This works, for the most part, because the bank insures deposits with the federal government and because the bank widely diversifies its exposure to risk to ensure that it won’t be caught short in the event of a financial crash.\nThis system occasionally fails in traditional finance (see: Lehman) but fails frequently in crypto. The government does not insure deposits to crypto platforms and the platforms often do not manage risk particularly well (see: FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network), making high-risk bets that end in catastrophe.\nRead More: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?\nAfter so many platforms squandered customer funds, crypto traders are thinking twice about depositing funds to crypto exchanges and lending institutions that “rehypothecate” uninsured deposits – which means they repurpose customer money and lend the funds out in the markets. A safer bet looks like trading on platforms that “fully back” their reserves. But what does this really mean, and should such claims be taken with a pinch of salt?\nWhen a financial product, such as a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to “fully back” its reserves, it means that it has stored enough money behind a product, like a stablecoin or a customer’s trading account, to support its worth.\nSo, a crypto exchange that “fully backs” its reserves should always be able to pay out customer withdrawals, no matter the state of the market. One such example is Coinbase, which does not lend out its customers’ funds without their express permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to prevent a bank run.\nA stablecoin that “fully backs” its reserves is always able to fulfill conversions to the original asset, no matter what. One example is wBTC, or wrapped bitcoin, which holds real bitcoin (BTC) in a cold wallet, then issues an equal amount of an Ethereum-based version of the coin that trades as an ERC-20 token.\nFully backed, however, does not necessarily mean that assets are held one to one. That claim refers to the idea that if you, say, give me a dollar, I’ll hold that dollar as a dollar and won’t turn it into something else. Lots of stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like U.S.-dollar stablecoin USDC, are not backed one to one.\nThis is because the companies that issue USDC hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in “cash and cash equivalents.” Cash equivalents refer to U.S. Treasury bonds, which is debt issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. These bonds, which pay small returns to holders over time, are close enough to the worth of actual U.S. dollars that the market accepts bonds being essentially worth the same.\nBut “fully backed” does not always mean that the backing can withstand financial shocks. U.S. dollar stablecoin tether (USDT) also claims that its reserves are fully backed, but this backing is secured by “other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether [the issuing company] to third parties.” So, USDT may be fully backed, but it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies.\nUntil October 2022, USDT was also backed by commercial paper – short-term commercial debt to other companies – and moved those funds to U.S. Treasurys. The concern about the commercial paper was that nobody knew which companies Tether was using to back USDT, so it was impossible to determine the worth of that backing. What’s more, its “fully backed” claim has historically turned out not to be true after it emerged in 2019 that USDT was, at one point, only 74% backed. As wrote the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u0027s Dawn D. Stump, the claim that it was backed to the U.S. dollar was “not 100% true, 100% of the time.”\nRead more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its Value\nSome stablecoins do not fully back their reserves, which has led to catastrophic results in some cases. The popular algorithmic stablecoin UST, for instance, crashed in spectacular fashion, wiping billions from the market.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, meaning it has more than enough crypto on hand to back its coin. DAI has survived several market crashes.\n\n",

    "content": "At CoinDesk, we’re not just chronicling the business model transformation that digital assets and the blockchain have made possible – we’re actively participating in it.\nAt Consensus 2021, a virtual event, we beta-tested DESK, an experiment in using tokenized rewards to incentivize engagement and community-building, garnering positive feedback from our audience. At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019.\nIn December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com.\nRead More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader Experience\nBelow is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information.\nDESK is CoinDesk’s social token.\nDESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content.\nDESK’s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together.\nAs of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include:\nAt Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as:\nDESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum.\nPolygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction.\nYou’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners.\nRead more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your Wallet\nYes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account.\nIn the Web2 era, content creators – be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers – have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines).\nWe’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms.\nWe believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal.\nWe hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event.\nSocial tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants.\nInitially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward.\nSimply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience.\nNo. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone’s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity.\nIt is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading.\nBy providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We\u0027ve seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization.\nNo. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users.\nNo. See above.\nNo. We\u0027re not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement.\nListing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use.\nIt’s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests.\nSo, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether.\nPart of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground.\nNo. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless.\nCoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon.\nBecause DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK\u0027s beta testers.\nPiranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept.\nAt Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk’s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike.\nCoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others.\nAs mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used.\nNavigate to the DESK dashboard. Select \"Create or Connect Wallet\" and approve the transaction in your wallet.\nDepends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com. We will not use this data for anything other than authenticating users when they sign on or distributing DESK rewards, we will never sell it, and we will protect user information assiduously. (See our privacy policy.) DESK transactions will appear on DESK\u0027s page on the Polyscan block explorer, but only the wallet addresses will be displayed.\nDESK has no inherent monetary value, but, whether or not you live in a jurisdiction where utility tokens are deemed taxable, you should consult a tax professional if you have concerns.\nWe’ll keep a record of airdrops, product developments and other updates critical to DESK’s roadmap and tokenomics in our DESK product blog.\nYou can also keep abreast of DESK updates in our Discord server.\nThe latest release is only the beginning in developing our Web3 model for DESK on coindesk.com. We\u0027ll be working on improving our wallet functionality, currently in beta, and looking forward to seeing what data and reader feedback reveal as to how to continue improving the experience\n",

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), met with Schumer on Thursday to get legislation moving, potentially tying it to reauthorization of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) funding, the site reported.\nOn the crypto event circuit, McHenry has repeatedly contended that it\u0027s still possible to get his panel\u0027s stablecoin bill passed for President Joe Biden to sign it into law, including in remarks earlier this week. McHenry is retiring from Congress this year and has put a priority on the legislation to provide guardrails to issuers of the tokens that, among other uses, provide a steadier foundation for the trading of more volatile cryptocurrencies.\nRead More: Key Congressman McHenry Is Bullish U.S. Stablecoin Law Will Pass This Year\nSen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who has also been trying to move digital assets legislation, said last month that Schumer was willing to work on a stablecoin bill.\nDespite its success in passing the House committee with a bipartisan vote, the legislation faces daunting hurdles. It could be difficult to get a floor vote in a House that has been virtually paralyzed by infighting – especially within the ranks of top Republicans. And the Senate Banking Committee has shown no interest in picking the idea up and matching it. That could leave the narrower option of engaging in esoteric legislative wrangling to get it attached to a must-move item, such as the FAA spending bill.\nSpokespeople for McHenry and Waters didn\u0027t immediately respond to requests for comment on the meeting.\nCrypto insiders in D.C. have been quietly lamenting it as a likely lost cause for this session, but the Schumer meeting and McHenry\u0027s optimism may keep hope alive.\n",

    "summary": "Stella Chan discusses the leading exchange’s way forward with a disruptive new social trading platform empowering users through their interactions.\n",
    "content": "Phemex has surged over the past year to become one of the world’s leading digital asset exchanges for both spot and futures transactions. It led the way in copy trading, bridged the gap between centralization and decentralization, and most recently, broke new ground with the launch of its revolutionary social trading platform. This innovative platform is crafted to bring the crypto community together, rewarding users for their regular online engagements with tangible benefits.\nThe introduction of PhemexPulse has sparked considerable buzz within the online sphere. CoinDesk reached out to Phemex COO Stella Chan to talk about the inspiration driving the development of PhemexPulse and the strategic moves the company plans to make in fostering dynamic and engaged communities.\nThank you for the congratulations! The launch of PhemexPulse has indeed stirred up considerable conversation among crypto enthusiasts. Users have discovered in PhemexPulse a vibrant platform that not only facilitates community engagement but also rewards their participation, creating a unique and interactive experience within the digital asset space.\nPhemexPulse has become a hub of activity with 160 groups formed by KOLs [key opinion leaders] and content creators in just two weeks. Users love that the platform allows them to continue their usual online activities – like following expert trading tips and engaging in trend discussions with peers – while earning rewards for their participation. And by rewards, we\u0027re talking substantial incentives: a daily prize pool of 9,000 PT. [Phemex Tokens, or PT, are the exchange’s native coins.] PT is fundamentally linked to our growing Web3 ecosystem and offers substantial promise for traders. Therefore, we are confident that the prize pool will strongly appeal to our community.\nThe landscape is indeed crowded with social networking platforms that users frequent, particularly during a bull market. PhemexPulse, though, distinguishes itself by not only rewarding users for their consistent online engagement but also by fostering a closer relationship between KOLs and their followers within a conversational environment. It offers a compelling chat-to-earn program for active participation that integrates seamlessly with our Web3 ecosystem.\nSocial trading is gaining significant traction and is expected to be a driving force in the upcoming bull market. While current offerings provide a preview of SocialFi\u0027s capabilities, there remains a void for a truly Web3-native social platform that prioritizes community interaction. PhemexPulse fills this niche by delivering an authentic, on-the-ground perspective of the crypto market\u0027s pulse through peer discussions and activities.\nUnlike other social trading platforms that focus solely on incentivizing trading, our approach is to cultivate a spirit of collaboration. We aim to foster grassroots innovation within PhemexPulse through Pulse Groups, where the ideas and contributions of any member can be recognized and developed into projects that benefit from a fair launch process, ensuring a level playing field for all.\nWe understand that KOLs have a variety of platforms to connect with their audience. Yet these platforms often dictate the terms of content creation, while PhemexPulse embraces Web3 principles to return control and ownership to the users. Collaborations and engagements within the PhemexPulse ecosystem directly translate into rewards.\nOur platform is designed to facilitate community contributions and the accumulation of tokens. For KOLs, monetizing their influence is as straightforward as establishing their own Web3 group on PhemexPulse, with funding from Phemex. By creating a group and fostering dialogue with their followers – through quality content and trading insights – KOLs can earn daily rewards in PT, based on their points accrued.\nPhemexPulse enables KOLs to excel by leveraging their strengths: leading and engaging with their audience. It removes barriers to community interaction, while Phemex provides the means to convert their influence into tangible PT wealth. We believe this model of engagement, unshackled from the confines of traditional social media and coupled with a reward system intrinsic to Web3, will forge new opportunities for KOLs.\nOn PhemexPulse we also provide them an avenue to unveil their exclusive inscriptions and share with their fans. These assets hold great potential and represent a mutually beneficial opportunity for both the KOLs and their followers to possess and exchange.\nInscriptions, akin to NFTs, are unique digital assets recorded directly onto the blockchain. Creators can craft these inscriptions and offer them to their followers, who can mint, own and trade them. On PhemexPulse, for instance, crypto influencers act as content creators and can launch their distinct ordinals through our inscription marketplace, allowing the value of each to be shaped by their community\u0027s demand. Supporters can engage with and back their preferred influencers on PhemexPulse by acquiring these inscriptions.\nInscriptions on PhemexPulse are a testament to the platform\u0027s foundational principles. PhemexPulse thrives on the creation of decentralized communities, spearheaded by KOLs. Within these groups, members have the freedom to collaborate and initiate their Web3 projects, enjoying full autonomy. We promote the development of distinctive group cultures and support the creation of community tokens through inscriptions, to enhance group solidarity and cohesion.\nOur team has dedicated significant effort to devising a scoring system that genuinely benefits our users. We are committed to ensuring that their contributions are recognized and rewarded fairly.\nWe have developed a system designed to enhance user engagement on PhemexPulse and the Phemex trading platform, aiming to forge a comprehensive hub that addresses users\u0027 trading and social interaction needs, empowering them through their activities on our platform. In tune with our community-focused approach, we\u0027ve decided to restructure the PhemexPulse scoring system to better align with user feedback. The newly launched mechanism will emphasize fairness while introducing gamified elements.\nWithin PhemexPulse, users can earn points through a variety of actions, including messaging within groups, executing trades and referring new users. Reward points have no expiration date, providing ongoing value for our users\u0027 trading efforts. Additionally, we\u0027ve introduced Raffle Fuel points, adding an extra dimension to our rewards system. Raffle Fuel points can be accrued through various trading activities on Phemex. The proportion of Reward and Raffle Fuel points compared to the total available points will determine the users’ PT payout. The total prize pool for PhemexPulse is a remarkable 50 million PT. With our updated scoring system, we\u0027re allocating 9,000 PT each day from our prize pool for distribution throughout this round.\nI must add that we have revamped the scoring system in response to our users\u0027 feedback, who are at the forefront of our efforts. We will continue to listen to their needs and make the necessary adjustments to the scoring system in the next rounds to ensure that they are rewarded fairly for their interactions.\nYes, we have so many exciting opportunities for traders. I mentioned earlier that PhemexPulse hosts an inscription marketplace where KOLs list their exclusive ordinals for minting, holding and trading. These limited edition assets allow users to own valuable items from top crypto figures and open up additional profit avenues. Notably, crypto influencer Ben Armstrong\u0027s ordinals on PhemexPulse saw astonishing growth within the first week of its release, driving real value for its holders.\nWe\u0027ve also recently updated the qualifications for becoming a PhemexPulse group owner, moving beyond the initial requirement of having at least 500 Twitter followers. We aim to make PhemexPulse a hub for all who are shaping Web3 and contributing uniquely to the crypto world. With these inclusive criteria, we aim to draw a variety of visionary leaders. We invite content creators to join us in steering the future of crypto.\n",

At maturity, the product will be settled in either USDT, XAUT or bitcoin as designated by OrBit, the Singapore-based company said.\nIn its statement, OrBit noted that traditional financial service firms (TradFi) commonly offer hybrid products, including those combining stocks and commodity assets.\nThe company said that investors “anticipating a sustained rally” in these two “safe haven” assets have risen amid growing concerns about the U.S. central bank’s hawkish monetary policy and resulting turmoil in the banking sector.\n“It\u0027s a dual option on both BTC and XAUT,” OrBit said, adding that investors could express “various sophisticated views” on bitcoin and the XAU token, including increases or decreases in returns for both, or if returns for one of the assets climbs but fall for the other.\nThe \"worst-of put option\" allows investors to earn an enhanced yield if both assets appreciate. On the flip side, investors may be \"put\" into the worst performer should either asset fall, the liquidity provider said.\nIn March, DeFi-focused asset management company MEV Capital used OrBit markets-issued options contracts to hedge liquidity providers’ positions and prevent losses in Uniswap (v3) liquidity pools.\n“OrBit aims to offer flexible solutions to our counterparties,” Pulkit Goyal, OrBit Markets VP of Trading adding that “OrBit plans to launch further hybrid products dedicated to institutional investors.”\n",

    "type": "Learn",
    "summary": "There are a few things that make Jack Dorsey’s vision for Web5 distinct, including not wanting to completely replace Web2 but work with it.\n",
    "content": "The world is still getting its collective head around Web3 – a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls \"Web5\"?\nIt turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey’s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises “an extra decentralized web platform.”\nTo land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 \u003d 5.\nWeb5’s core idea is to “put you in control of your data and identity” – a core tenet of Web3’s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet’s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS.\nDorsey’s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data “captive in app silos,” Web5 pushes for “a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.”\nThere are three pillars at Web5’s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017.\nSo, what’s new here – apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey’s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any “special utility tokens or subjective consensus” that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service.\nIn doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin’s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5’s nascent community already balked at TBD’s attempt to trademark the term Web5.\nThe other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5’s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user’s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform.\nTBD’s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to “help her visualize her itinerary.” Again, the idea is to tie data that’s usually locked inside centralized services – something TBD calls “a massive, unworkable mess” – to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user’s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes.\nWill it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that’s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS).\nOne of the key things that distinguish TBD’s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it’s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5’s announcement: “Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It’s like a high school student saying ‘yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it’s meant to be.’ It’s naive.”\n",

    "summary": "The \"restaking\" protocol with $15 billion in deposits won\u0027t pay rewards to depositors and is missing its mission-critical \"slashing\" feature.\n",
    "content": "The blockchain project EigenLayer didn\u0027t go live on Ethereum\u0027s mainnet until Tuesday, but it had already become one of the network\u0027s biggest-ever protocols, with $12 billion worth of user deposits – a hot ticket partly because of its highly touted innovation of \"restaking,\" a new technology that could usher in dramatic changes in the way crypto protocols bootstrap their security.\nA closer inspection reveals that EigenLayer has not yet activated most of the core features that make the project notable – including its reward system and its mission-critical \"slashing\" mechanism.\nIn the fast-moving, big-money world of crypto, EigenLayer has attracted a level of investor, developer and media interest that\u0027s rare: On top of its $15 billion worth of deposits at press time, Eigen Labs, the project\u0027s developer, raised a staggering $100 million from venture giant Andreessen Horowitz last year.\nThere\u0027s also a cottage industry of startups – called \"actively validated services\" (AVSs) – that are waiting to plug into EigenLayer\u0027s security apparatus, as well as \"liquid restaking\" startups aiming to piggyback off of EigenLayer\u0027s success, already netting billions of dollars in their own deposits.\nEigenDA, a data-availability protocol built by Eigen Labs, was the first AVS to launch on EigenLayer – released on Tuesday in tandem with the rest of the EigenLayer protocol. As other AVS networks wait in the wings – for now, they\u0027re only allowed to \"register\" – EigenDA is supposed to be a proof-of-concept for what EigenLayer will eventually enable for other services: A way for networks to base their own security on Ethereum\u0027s.\nIn EigenLayer\u0027s current, arguably still larval state, however, EigenDA relies on a strikingly conventional security model. The protocol is controlled by a globally distributed set of operators, but they won\u0027t be financially punished if they act dishonestly – a core component of EigenLayer\u0027s purported security model. The protocol also won\u0027t pay out rewards to depositors, which is supposed to be the main incentive for restaking.\nSreeram Kannan, EigenLayer\u0027s founder and chief architect, acknowledged in an interview last week that the launch would move forward without some crucial functionality, instead proceeding under a \"phased\" rollout under an unspecified timeline.\n\"We are allowing the EigenLayer marketplace to develop and stabilize before introducing in-protocol payments and slashing to mainnet later this year,\" EigenLayer said on Tuesday in its launch thread.\nThe use of so-called training wheels is not out of the norm in crypto – particularly given the experimental culture of the industry: When a startup is trusted with billions of dollars in user deposits, Silicon Valley\u0027s \"move fast and break things\" approach doesn\u0027t really cut it.\n\"There are a lot of other projects that just take shortcuts and kind of balloon and are much, much higher risk than this,\" said Mike Silagadze, CEO of Ether.fi, a liquid restaking service that has deposited $3.8 billion worth of its users\u0027 funds into EigenLayer. \"I think relative to other crypto projects, this has actually been reasonably measured.\"\nBut as the third-largest decentralized finance protocol in terms of total value locked (TVL) – and competitors beginning to encroach on its turf – expectations for EigenLayer couldn\u0027t be higher.\nEigenLayer centers around \"restaking\" – a way of repurposing the Ethereum blockchain\u0027s security to cover additional protocols, these AVSs. Technically how it works is that investors can take the ether (ETH) they\u0027ve staked on the main Ethereum chain, and then reapply (or \"restake\") it to secure the AVSs; they could be blockchain bridges, crypto exchanges or data storage facilities.\nThe benefit for EigenLayer investors – called \"restakers\" – is that they get an extra rate of return on top of the interest they already receive for staking ETH. The AVSs get the advantage of \"pooled security.\"\nKannan gives the example of 100 blockchain protocols that are each secured by $1 billion worth of stake.\nImagine that \"instead of each of the protocols having $1 billion separately staked, there was $100 billion commonly staked across 100 protocols,\" said Kannan. \"To attack any one protocol, now you need $100 billion rather than needing $1 billion.\"\nThat\u0027s the idea, at least. The actual meat of the EigenLayer security system remains more theory at this point than reality, as do the pieces of EigenLayer\u0027s design that are supposed to pay out interest to depositors.\nTake, for example, the \"slashing\" feature that sits at the center of EigenLayer\u0027s security system. Slashing is integral to EigenLayer: It ensures that networks built on top of the protocol can penalize operators if they act dishonestly – by revoking all or a portion of their restaked deposits.\nBut slashing wasn\u0027t included in EigenLayer\u0027s launch this week, and in an interview, Kannan couldn\u0027t give a firm timeline on when it would be ready – beyond that it would be sometime later this year.\nThere also remain big questions about how the whole thing will actually work – including how, and in what proportion, slashed tokens will be burned and distributed once they\u0027ve been revoked. For AVSs to build on EigenLayer, such questions eventually need to be answered.\n\"Even though the full slashing is not live, we are going to run this system in beta and make sure that people are able to use it, and maybe have redundant backups and other stuff,\" said Kannan.\nAnother yet-to-be-defined element of EigenLayer\u0027s programming is its \"attributable security\" system – a fallback mechanism that Kannan plans to use to protect against black swan events that threaten to wipe out the protocol\u0027s security apparatus. The feature exists to address the potential for contagion risk – the idea that a slashing event triggered by one AVS could hurt the security of every other AVS.\nAttributable security works a lot like insurance (crypto founders mint new terms as quickly as they do new tokens), and in principle, a new actuarial market will spring up with pricing for each of the AVSs, ostensibly linked to their perceived risk.\n\"A service that\u0027s built on Eigenlayer can come in and say, \u0027Out of this $100 billion that is totally staked, I want a particular attribution of $3 billion,\u0027\" explained Kannan. \"Now, it\u0027s EigenLayer as a protocol\u0027s job to make sure that even if every other AVS is simultaneously depleted, I will be able to redistribute the amount of $3 billion to this AVS.\"\nBut asked to define how EigenLayer\u0027s attributable security market will actually price things in practice, Kannan said that his team \"has not published\" anything on it yet.\nThen there\u0027s EigenLayer\u0027s fee system – the source of revenue it will use to reward interest to depositors, which is supposed to be the main incentive for restaking.\nKannan said in an interview with CoinDesk that the fee system is at the top of his team\u0027s priority list and should be easy to implement, but its absence means that users won\u0027t be able to earn interest for restaking with AVSs.\nIn the absence of this core feature, the billions of dollars deposited into EigenLayer thus far have come as a result of the platform\u0027s point system: EigenLayer prints out loyalty points that investors hope will eventually be convertible into real crypto tokens.\nUntil EigenLayer launched this week, many crypto traders and users were simply pursuing these points – Earning them by depositing assets into EigenLayer and liquid restaking protocols like Ether.Fi, and, in some cases, buying the points outright and trading them on 40x leverage via third-party crypto protocols aimed at risk-seekers.\n\"In hindsight, I would probably say, man, we should have really toned down the point stuff because that just went really crazy,\" said Ether.Fi\u0027s Silgadze. \"Crypto is insane, so people took it way too far.\"\nRead more: As Crypto \u0027Points\u0027 Farming Grows, So Does Risk of Vague Promises\nWithout slashing, fees and attributable security, EigenDA, currently the only AVS, is a far cry from what is ultimately envisioned for EigenLayer.\nIn the near term, EigenDA will be operated by a community of validators, but those validators won\u0027t be at risk of slashing – this means they won\u0027t be financially incentivized to act honestly (which is, well… the whole point of EigenLayer\u0027s \"pooled security\").\nKannan says most of EigenLayer\u0027s main features will arrive by the end of this year, but some find it difficult to take those estimates at face value.\n“In some cases, there\u0027s just engineering problems, where you kind of bat your head against it, and eventually you\u0027re gonna figure it out,\" said Silgadze. \"And then there\u0027s research problems [...] there\u0027s literally no solution known.\"\nWhen it comes to those research problems, \"it\u0027s hard to respect timelines,\" said Silgadze, \"because these are unsolved problems that you\u0027re trying to sort out.\"\nThe lack of clarity around the state of EigenLayer\u0027s technical stack has led to mounting frustration among some EigenLayer developers who requested anonymity in order to discuss the topic candidly – along with confusion for users around where EigenLayer currently sits on its ambitious roadmap.\nThere are also concerns that EigenLayer\u0027s design is tantamount to \"rehypothecation\" – an oft-criticized practice from traditional finance where collateral is repackaged for higher potential returns, but also a higher risk of losses. (Kannan vehemently rebuts this argument, stating that, among other things, EigenLayer is different from conventional rehypothecation because it grants users complete control over their assets.)\n\"I think we need to get better at communicating changes and our roadmap to the broader EigenLayer ecosystem,\" said Kannan. \"We did not expect to be at this scale where there\u0027s so many projects that are dependent and are downstream of our codebase.\"\nCalvin Liu, Eigen Labs\u0027 chief strategy officer, says he welcomes the scrutiny.\n\"When something has a ton of hype, that’s when you should examine most closely and be most skeptical. I appreciate that and take that view to other projects all the time,\" Liu said in a message on Telegram. \"I am confident that in time we’ll stand up to that view. And I welcome the prodding - it only makes us better in the long run.\"\n",

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\nDecentralized crypto exchange Uniswap received a notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it intends to pursue an enforcement action, the company said Wednesday. Uniswap\u0027s native token, UNI, dropped 9.5% immediately after the news and has lost 18% over the past 24 hours. Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams announced receipt of the so-called Wells notice on X, saying he wasn’t surprised, “just annoyed, disappointed, and ready to fight.” Wells notices are preliminary warnings that inform respondents of the charges the regulator is considering bringing against them. They usually lead to enforcement actions. In a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, COO Mary-Catherine Lader and Chief Legal Officer Marvin Ammori told reporters that the Wells notice was focused on Uniswap acting as an unregistered securities broker and unregistered securities exchange. It remains unclear whether the UNI token was implicated as a potential security in the SEC’s notice.\nBitcoin’s (BTC) much anticipated halving event later this month could see a flurry of bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting upside on both technical and meme-coin projects. Halving reduces the rate at which new coins are created and lowers the available new supply. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. This event has historically preceded a bull market for the token. Crypto traders say participants seek a “reason to buy” as money narratives continuously shift in the current bullish environment and they may turn their focus on the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming weeks.\nHeightened anticipation for spot-based bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and the eventual inflows supercharged bitcoin\u0027s run-up to all-time highs, and now Hong Kong\u0027s regulators are reportedly inching closer to approving similar funds, news that thus far has been mostly unnoticed in crypto circles. These vehicles, however, could open the floodgates for Chinese investors looking for a new haven next to gold, overseas real estate and stocks in which to store their wealth. \"[They] will be a big deal,\" Noelle Acheson, macro analyst and author of Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said in an email interview with CoinDesk. \"It\u0027s not just for the access to hedge funds and family offices based in the region; it\u0027s also because of the access it gives to mainland investors.\"\n",

    "type": "Technology",
    "summary": "\"The main problem was our lack of organizational execution,\" MarginFi\u0027s longtime leader Edgar Pavlovsky told CoinDesk.\nMarginFi’s longtime leader, Edgar Pavlovsky, resigned Wednesday following an internal dispute at the protocol\u0027s builder, mrgn.\nThe abrupt exit won’t impact MarginFi\u0027s borrow-and-lend functions, but it did spur $100 million in capital flight.\n",
    "content": "Edgar Pavlovsky, the CEO of the company building crypto borrow-and-lend platform MarginFi resigned Wednesday as internal fissures at the major Solana DeFi project erupted into public view.\n“I don\u0027t agree with the way things have been done internally or externally,” Pavlovsky said in a resignation notice on X, formerly Twitter. MarginFi\u0027s own account called the departure of its co-founder “a function of internal operational disagreements and of his own personal reasons.\"\nThe abrupt exit capped a fiery day for Solana\u0027s second-largest lending platform that saw allegations fly and tempers flare. Amidst the chaos, users pulled nearly $100 million from the platform, according to analytics site DeFiLlama – MarginFi\u0027s largest-ever day of withdrawals.\n\"All products remain fully operational and are unaffected (and can not be affected) by this departure. The point of DeFi is that core contributors can walk away, and the protocol marches on,\" MarginFi said in a tweet.\nMarginFi\u0027s meltdown comes after weeks of withdrawal function issues at the borrow-and-lend platform and months after it launched a points program that preceded a wave of growth-fueling incentivization loyalty schemes across Solana DeFi.\nBut while other protocols reward their points-earning users with a token, MarginFi hasn\u0027t, much to the anger of some of its users.\nIn mid-March, a problem in MarginFi\u0027s price data sourcing \"oracle\" infrastructure had caused some users\u0027 withdrawal requests to fail to start when Solana\u0027s network congestion was still rising.\n\"The stale Oracle issues currently impact withdrawals, not deposits, I think, so it\u0027s leading to some accusations from users who feel that MarginFi is just taking their deposits and not letting them withdraw,\" the builder of popular liquid staking service SolBlaze told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.\nSolBlaze lodged its own accusations against MarginFi on Wednesday. The service rewards holders of its bSOL and BLZE tokens with more tokens, which are called emissions. Depositors of SolBlaze tokens on MarginFi also get these reward payouts, but via mrgn and MarginFi.\nHowever, for at least eight days those payments through MarginFi had not been getting to bSOL and BLZE token owners, according to SolBlaze. This was due to a quirk in the way MarginFi handled earmarked tokens, but it was left unmonitored and with no communication to SolBlaze, which has since severed its business relationship with MarginFi.\n\"The main problem was our lack of organizational execution,\" Pavlovsky told CoinDesk in a Telegram message sent hours before he announced his resignation.\nPavlovsky\u0027s exit throws MarginFi\u0027s leadership into uncertainty. An employee of the New York City-centric project referred CoinDesk to MarginFi\u0027s statement.\n\"We want to assure the community that the core contributors, the company, and our investors are actively engaged to ensure a smooth transition,\" the post read without saying who was taking over.\nKyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, an investor in MarginFi, posted on X that he remains committed to the protocol and is not withdrawing anything.\nOne candidate may be MacBrennan Peet, another co-founder of MarginFi with a history of embracing online controversy, including releasing a video of himself shirtless and crowing \"wen token\" in December 2023.\n\"Moving forward, I\u0027ll be a more authentic person online,\" he said in a tweet. Peet called his previous social media stunts and \"very intentionally controversial\" persona a \"growth-hacking\" strategy that \"largely worked\" to boost MarginFi\u0027s user base.\nGrowth hack or not, that persona also succeeded in making MarginFi its enemies in Solana DeFi. One of them was Solend, once the leading protocol for borrow-and-lend on Solana.\nMoving to capitalize on its foe\u0027s weaknesses, Solend announced it would airdrop a token to MarginFi users who move their money to Solend and keep it there. At press time, the push hadn\u0027t yet led to a noticeable uptick in deposits on Solend, according to DeFillama.\nOn a day where MarginFi lost $80 million to withdrawals, the major borrow-and-lend platform Kamino saw $51 million in deposits, its third largest day of inflows ever.\nFrom Mac\u0027s \"wen token\" shirtless meme video to the daily chants of \"wen token\" in MarginFi\u0027s Telegram channel, the protocol faces intense pressure to drop a new crypto asset to its user base.\n\"People feel like they\u0027ve been farmed for TVL without getting the airdrop that they would have expected from a points program,\" SolBlaze said.\nOn Wednesday MarginFi, MacBrennan and mrgn had little to reveal about when, or even if, it would launch a governance token that decentralizes its decision-making. Such an asset would theoretically give holders a vote in the operations of MarginFi. If it were airdropped to users it would likely provide a windfall to the thousands of points earners who have farmed MarginFi since July 2023.\n\"The MRGN development team will carry on work towards full decentralization,\" a tweet read.\nThe departure of Pavlovsky will not impact mtnDAO, a biannual month-long coworking event hosted in Salt Lake City by MarginFi and Cypher, said Cypher CEO Barrett Williams, a close friend of Pavlovsky.\n\"I don\u0027t have next steps yet, but as mrgn\u0027s founder it\u0027s ultimately my failure that this happened, and like I\u0027ve done for years, I\u0027ll reflect and evolve,\" Pavlovksy said in his resignation tweet, which came around three hours after SolBlaze\u0027s first accusation.\nLess than an hour later, he was back: \"Okay, what should I build next.\"\n\n",

An ongoing meme coin frenzy on Solana and Base networks has netted millions in profits for platform owners and users, but it comes with risks for the community and investors.\nSome risks include teams dumping tokens after creating social media hype, early investors selling large amounts, removal of liquidity, and developers having access to change code for tokens, Cronje said.\nThe proposed plan is to issue tokens with the Fantom Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to Fantom blockchain\u0027s development and maintenance, as one of the signers controlling the token’s liquidity pools.\n“Up to 5% of the tokens to support the meme team expenses. This will be locked in a multisig requiring signatures from 2 project members and at least 1 foundation member,” Cronje said.\n“The remaining 85% of the tokens will be put up in a FTM/token LP in foundation multisig. An amount of 100,000 FTM will be provided. Any Fantom-based exchange can be nominated for LP,” he added. LP refers to liquidity pool, a smart contract on an exchange that holds two or more tokens and facilitates trading.\nUp to 10% of tokens can be allocated for marketing-related expenses, such as exchange listings, and will be locked in a multisig requiring signatures from two project members and at least one Foundation member.\n“Should the FTM in the LP token reach at least 2,000,000 FTM, the original provided 100,000 FTM (5%) will be removed to cover the initial cost and the rest of the LP will be burned,” Cronje added.\nFantom’s Cronje is the latest in a line of blockchain teams that aren’t shying away from engaging with meme coins directly – marking a clear departure from previous cycles in which such tokens were treated as mere tradeable assets.\nAvalanche Foundation, a similar body for the Avalanche network, earlier this year announced a fund that invested directly in and supported the growth of meme coins (which it termed culture coins). In March, it invested in five tokens.\nLast week, BNB Chain developers unveiled a $1 million prize pool that attracted submissions from developers behind meme coins. The pool aimed to award projects it deemed unique for investing in their future growth.\n",

    "type": "Learn",
    "summary": "Following the SEC charges against the world’s largest crypto exchange, people are wondering what’s the difference between Binance and Binance.us, who is Changpeng Zhao and more.\n",
    "content": "Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who is often referred to as just “CZ,” Binance is the world\u0027s leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of June 2023. The company was originally based in China but had to leave Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions shortly after its launch.\nBinance developed its own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (later renamed to BNB Chain), which facilitates trades on the exchange. The native token of the blockchain is Binance coin (BNB) and the company has also launched a stablecoin, BinanceUSD (BUSD). Because of U.S. regulatory rules, Binance created a supposedly separate company for its U.S. clients in 2019, Binance.US.\nOn June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US as well as CZ, who serves as Binance CEO, on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering BNB and BUSD to the general public, calling them unregistered securities. The SEC lawsuit also casts fresh doubt on the independence of the company’s U.S. arm and its staking service.\nRead more about the SEC suit here\nThis is not Binance’s first battle with U.S. regulators. Binance is also under ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who sued CZ and Binance in March 2023, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S.\nHere is everything you need to know about Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao.\nCZ is a well-known personality in crypto, actively engaging with the crypto community through Twitter and speaking at conferences and to the media. As for his origins, he was born in China and emigrated to Canada when he was 12 and says he is a Canadian citizen. In high school, he worked part-time at McDonald’s, which is part of his well-known lore. He graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science.\nAfter college, he worked for the Tokyo stock exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook developing software for the businesses. He then founded a startup in 2005, Fusion Systems, which focused on creating an automated high-frequency trading platform. Following that, he worked for several crypto startups including a stint as co-founder and CTO of OKCoin. Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.\nAccording to the white paper, Zhao\u0027s goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support.\nShortly after Binance’s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper.\nBinance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China’s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance’s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based.\nBinance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance\u0027s proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange.\nBinance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance’s services.\nOne of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange.\nThe other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees.\nFinally, unlike Binance’s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange.\nJuly 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO.\nJuly 2018: Binance acquires Trust Wallet, a free, non-custodial mobile wallet to support its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) offering.\nJanuary 2019: Binance starts to offer support for new token listings through ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings), through its Launchpad product.\nApril 2019: Binance migrates BNB from Ethereum to its proprietary chain, then called Binance Smart Chain (now rebranded to Binance chain or BNB chain)\nApril 2019: Binance launches its DEX ahead of schedule.\nMay 2019: Binance gets hacked for the first time. Hackers steal over 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) from Binance (the equivalent of roughly $41 million at the time). Zhao quickly took to social media to reassure users that no one lost funds and that Binance used its reserve funds to cover the costs of the stolen crypto.

    "title": "These developers are mashing ERC-20 tokens and NFTs together: Will it work?",
    "type": "Crypto Ecosystems",
    "summary": "While the Pandora team describes ERC-404 as a “Frankenstein’s monster,” it claims there’s method in its madness.\nA team of four have combined the ERC-20 token standard and NFTs to create a new standard of semi-fungible tokens called ERC-404.\nWe explore how this came to be, how the project works and what’s next.\n",
    "content": "It was around 9 AM in Toronto, Canada, on Feb. 1 when a designer and crypto trader who goes by ctrl on X — his real name is Arya Khalaj — thought he had stumbled onto something brilliant. The project was called Emerald and it claimed to combine ERC-20 tokens with NFTs in a way that could solve NFT liquidity issues for good. It appeared to be the solution for a lot of issues ctrl had come across while working with different crypto projects. He went all in. While chatting online with a friend known pseudonymously as Searn, they started throwing in clips of ether. During this time, the chart just kept going up. Once they ran out of ether, they dipped into their investments in other projects and were soon in to the tune of around $60,000 each. Then, without warning, the project was exploited and the bottom fell out of the chart. Ctrl — who was holed up in a small Airbnb as his lease had expired during a three-month trip to Tokyo — was devastated. “We were sitting there, in total shock, and we were like, what just happened?” he told The Block in an interview. The two crypto traders spoke with a friend and former Coinbase engineer known pseudonymously as Acme about the situation. They reached out to the developer of Emerald and asked if they could help fix the project and bring it back to life. Yet the developer seemed uninterested in getting any help, they said, and planned to relaunch anyway with a quick patch. Acme took a look at the code, said it was barely designed to work at all anyway and would require a full rewrite. So that’s what they did. “We\u0027d been up all night,” said ctrl. “We stayed up for the next 26 hours or so after that. So we\u0027ve been up for two days at this point, just building this thing in a single sprint.” At the end of it, they had built a working implementation of a token standard that combines ERC-20 tokens and NFTs. They called it ERC-404, named after the common website error message. “We thought it was a fitting name because the whole thing was so experimental and we knew it would confuse many protocols and dapps when we launched it because it has mixed ERC-721 and ERC-20 functions,” said ctrl. What is an ERC-404 token? While ERC-20 tokens are fungible tokens that can be replaced by any other token, NFTs are unique tokens that are non-fungible, and can’t be switched like-for-like. ERC-404 combines both ideas to create what the team calls a semi-fungible token. The team acknowledged that this creates some sort of Frankenstein’s monster. “It\u0027s just a matter of actually understanding how to mix two things that have never been mixed and weren’t designed to be mixed together — and are actually conflicting,” ctrl said. In practice, it looks like this: a project can offer 100 tokens and 100 NFTs, for example, where each token is linked to an NFT. If someone buys less than a whole token, the NFT is burned and they just have a fraction of a token. If they combine this with more fractions of a token, an NFT is minted back into their wallet. The core idea is that it allows people to buy and sell NFTs, as well as parts of an NFT, where the parts are represented as tokens. Since two halves of a token can be combined to create an NFT, the tokens should, in theory, retain the value of the underlying NFT potential — even when it\u0027s temporarily gone. Two half tokens will be worth half of a whole token and NFT combo because they can be combined at will to create the whole token with the corresponding NFT. The only issue is that combining two tokens won\u0027t return the same NFT, so its value might be a bit variable — but this will also depend on the specific project in question as each project can implement the token standard in its own way; choosing how many NFTs they want per token and how the NFTs are regenerated. For instance, a project might generate new NFTs every time they’re minted, or they might have all NFTs look the same. With NFTs getting constantly minted and burned, this raises the question of whether the token design will result in a lot of costly transaction fees. A developer known as quit on X noted that the current system is more expensive than current NFT projects. The team acknowledged that this is a potential issue but said they have been focused on optimizing it. Opening Pandora’s box The team of four — comprising ctrl, Searn, Acme and another individual known as Hohenheim — named their project Pandora and created the first token under the ERC-404 token standard on Feb. 2. It’s worth noting that while they have done some tests, it’s still unaudited and carries some risk.

The NFTs are in the form of boxes with five different colors — each with varying levels of rarity — that may later reveal different artwork. Anyone who buys a token will get an NFT — and, if they spend half of that token, the NFT is destroyed. When new NFTs are minted, they are randomized, meaning that the distribution and rarity can change over time. This means users need to be careful they don’t accidentally destroy their own rare NFTs, which could get replaced with more common ones. “[ERC-404] allows you to do things that were never possible with ERC-721. And because of that, there are a lot of different implementations, a lot of different ways you could approach the concepts. We obviously had to just choose one,” said ctrl. “But people are already doing their own things.” At launch, 7% of the supply was allocated to the team and early contributors. Upon launch, the team purchased 23% of the total supply to be used to provide extra liquidity through market makers or for token listings. So far, the project has seen $100 million of trading volume on decentralized exchanges. The token has reached a price of around $12,800, giving the project a fully diluted valuation of $125 million, while the NFTs have reached a similar floor price. Some projects are testing the waters Since launch, a few projects have started experimenting with the Pandora token. On-chain index project Peopods Finance has added the Pandora token so it can be wrapped and used to generate yield. Lending platform Teller has added it so it can be used as collateral for loans. Furthermore, trading platform Wasabi Protocol has listed it, enabling perpetual trading of the token. In the near term, the team is planning to propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal — something that, if accepted, would make Ethereum better designed to support this sort of token standard. Hohenheim said the team didn’t want to give a hard timeline but that it’s talking about a number of days, not weeks, before doing so. The team is also preparing to launch a protocol very soon that could speed up the adoption of ERC-404 tokens, ctrl said. It would provide creators and developers with the tools and infrastructure for building products involving ERC-404 tokens. “What we\u0027re doing now is we are focused less on the usual NFT gimmicks and more on building, like actual functional, usable, user-facing products, that also integrate with our collection and that make people want to hold our collection because of the incentives that they get,” he said. Why create ERC-404 tokens? While understanding how ERC-20 tokens and NFTs can be combined together is one thing, another question is why anyone would want to do so. The Pandora team said there were two main reasons why this makes sense. The first is that it could help with liquidity for NFTs. Ctrl said that any NFT built on the ERC-404 standard would have liquidity as long as there’s a liquidity pool. This means any NFT can be sold at any time without needing to find a buyer counterparty. “People get mad when people floor 40 [NFTs] at a time. Well, now you effectively have a token price that reflects a floor price in real-time, and there\u0027s no such thing as a thick or third floor because there is actual native liquidity,” he said. The second reason is that it can provide native fractionalization of NFTs. Right now, to fractionalize an NFT, you need to lock it up and create a number of tokens that represent the overall NFT — something that is tricky to unwind and piece back together. By providing native fractionalization, the idea is that ERC-404 tokens could offer a better user experience. “That\u0027s why native fractionalization is such a big deal, I think, because it\u0027s actually a feature built in,” said ctrl. “People don\u0027t need to feel like they have to go and do some weird four-step process and get this kind of legitimate NFT that\u0027s a derivative.” Ctrl also noted that NFTs using the ERC-404 token standard could be applied in the gaming industry, particularly when it comes to the gamification of destroying and reminting NFTs with a randomization factor. If successful, this would incentivize more trading of these tokens, something that could spur wider adoption. Although that\u0027s assuming people will be able to get their heads around semi-fungibility of course. Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

The FBI subpoena is allegedly in connection with Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr’s claim that he was stolen about 216 BTC in a hack.\n“As part of the investigation into Luke Dashjr’s announced theft of his bitcoins, I received a subpoena from the FBI wanting information about attendees of the October 2022 CoreDev Atlanta event in the days before TABConf 2022,” said Schmidt, in an email screenshot\nWednesday by mikeinspace, a pseudonymous X user. “I was legally advised to cooperate.”\nSchmidt, who confirmed with The Block that he sent that email, said in the message to attendees that he had provided the FBI with their first and last names, GitHub usernames and email addresses. Schmidt also said that the FBI demanded that he not disclose the subpoena for a year, which expired shortly before he sent out the email.\n“I do not have any details about the investigation or whether the subpoena was due to a targeted suspect or general information gathering as part of the investigation,” Schmidt added.\nThe Brink co-founder told The Block that he has not been in contact with the FBI since, and declined to comment on further details.\nBitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr\nthat he lost over 200 BTC due to a Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) key compromise on Dec. 31, 2022, an estimated loss of about $3.3 million at the time.

    "content": "Blockchains are poised to become a foundational element of digital infrastructure. This report focuses on fundamental differences in blockchain design that have been chosen by different protocols to pave the way for mass adoption. Despite all modern blockchains aiming to deliver public rails that are performant and secure, their approaches and timelines to achieve those goals vary. To shed light on these differences, we outline the main functions blockchains perform and introduce a framework to categorize them. With case study-type analyses of Ethereum and Cosmos, along with a thorough review of Solana’s design approach, we compare their strengths and weaknesses. Our study highlights the critical differences between horizontal and vertical scaling and the trade-offs between them. This comparison provides a detailed perspective on the technological choices and strategies influencing the evolution of smart contract platforms as the backbone of a growing on-chain financial economy.

Part 2 contextualizes the tradeoffs required for scaling blockchains across each function (such as data storage or execution), highlighting the way in which scalability optimization impacts important properties such as decentralization, security and interoperability. Part 3 takes a deep dive into Solana’s design philosophy as an execution-focused, vertically integrated blockchain, as well as the many unique hurdles it has faced in the pursuit of achieving greater scalability. Finally, Part 4 compares the key design choices taken by protocols in the context of their varying scaling approaches, offering insights into their progress to date alongside critical commentary from the builders and thinkers shaping the future of blockchain design.

    "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is delving into decentralized finance in a predictable move as it gears up to sue one of the largest decentralized exchanges. Decentralized exchange Uniswap said on Wednesday that it had received a Wells notice, i.e. a formal notice from the SEC that says the agency plans to bring charges against a respondent, which could come in the next month or so. Uniswap founder and CEO Hayden Adams said he wasn\u0027t surprised, but was \"annoyed, disappointed and ready to fight.\" The SEC has gone after other exchanges, though those were more centralized, including Coinbase, Kraken and Binance. The agency\u0027s foray to sue Uniswap is unique, said Jennifer Schulp, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian think tank Cato Institute. \"This is a new area for them to be moving forward with, although it\u0027s certainly not one that surprises me or anyone that they\u0027re continuing to open up new areas of new fronts in the battle against crypto,\" Schulp said in an interview with The Block. Many DeFi protocols don\u0027t operate with U.S. customers and go out of their way to block U.S. customers\u0027 access to the protocols. Uniswap was unusual in that it remains committed to servicing U.S. customers, Schulp said. The crypto industry has criticized the SEC over what it calls its \"regulation by enforcement\" approach and says it\u0027s not possible to register with the agency under its current rules. In Washington, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has argued that most cryptocurrencies are securities and should be regulated similarly to other investments.

Putting the exchanges out of business has a bigger impact on the industry than one particular cryptocurrency, she added. \"I think this is just the beginning of [the SEC] moving into the DeFi space,\" Goody Guillén said, adding that the current securities regulatory regime doesn\u0027t work for cryptocurrencies. \"It\u0027s unfortunate that the SEC isn\u0027t engaging more with industry and realizing the holes that are in the securities regime,\" she said.

The rulemaking, which was proposed in January 2022, would require DeFi projects to make regular filings with the SEC, be subject to mandatory disclosures and have strict limits on how they operate. The rule proposal can be read as a \"recognition that the current regulatory landscape does not clearly cover DeFi,\" said the Cato Institute\u0027s Schulp. \"Plainly by proposing that rule, the SEC thinks it has the authority — I would disagree with that and a lot of people disagreed with that,\" Schulp said. \"The fact that they\u0027re going to move forward on a DeFi exchange case prior to the rule being put into place is really interesting and disappointing, particularly given the calls for clarity of regulation over the past several years.\" A potential crapshoot What happens next depends on which judge is assigned to the case, said BakerHostetler\u0027s Goody Guillén. \"Different judges have such differing opinions and that’s how circuit splits are created, which can then be resolved at the U.S. Supreme Court,\" she said. Judges have all been different in how they approach making decisions in crypto cases, from separating out institutional sales from programmatic sales to siding with the SEC over some crypto, including an algorithmic stablecoin. The executive branch is struggling to regulate an industry that does not fit easily within the SEC\u0027s current regulatory authority, said John Aughenbaugh, associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. \"For the SEC to investigate Uniswap or any other cryptocurrency exchange, it has to make and justify the claim that the firm operating the exchange is in effect selling bonds or other security instruments that fall within the SEC\u0027s authorizing legislation and regulatory authority,\" Aughenbaugh said in an email to The Block. If the firm gets the \"right\" judges, the SEC could falter, the professor added. \"Thus, until or unless Congress clearly passes legislation on the matter, it is a crapshoot as to whether the SEC has the authority to regulate any cryptocurrency market (like that operated by Uniswap Labs) and whether the federal courts will legally bless the SEC\u0027s efforts in this regard,\" he said.

    "title": "Crypto projects have given out 40 billion points so far. When will it end?",
    "type": "Crypto Ecosystems",
    "summary": "Crypto projects are offering points instead of airdrops — to the delight of VCs and the chagrin of everyone else.\nIn lieu of airdrops, crypto projects have been handing out points to reward loyal users.\nWhile many investors complain, VCs argue that there’s an upside here.\n",
    "content": "If there’s one thing that’s united members of the crypto community in recent months, it’s the emergence of points. Only they’re not in favor of them, but dead set against them. “Points are probably the stupidest detour crypto has taken in my time here. Also borderline scammy,” said Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, on X. This frustrated sentiment can be seen in the responses to new projects announcing their points programs. “Wow nice some points, how exciting. Imagine doing tokens when you could give points,” sarcastically replied one X user on Jan. 23 when crypto wallet Rabby revealed its new program — while others were even harsher in their criticisms. Why do points get a bad rep? It’s not hard to see why. Over the last few years, projects have rewarded loyal users and successful airdrop hunters with sudden issuances of tokens, often worth thousands of dollars — and sometimes in the regions of hundreds of thousands of dollars. For some, it can be life-changing money. Unsurprisingly, this phenomenon resulted in an entire ecosystem of airdrop hunters looking to cash in on the next big airdrop. But points are antithetical to what the airdrop hunter is looking for. With airdrops, those who carried out some trades in the hope of an airdrop and got lucky when it arrived felt like they had beaten the system in some way — that their ingenuity, or sheer luck, had resulted in this unexpected windfall. Yet with points, users are obeying the system and being obedient, hoping that the system will look kindly upon them and reward their loyal actions with tokens some day. There\u0027s no edge to be gained and it’s simply just not as fun. Beyond this, points are more of an IOU that might never be delivered upon, just a number on a screen that harks back to the days of web2. They’re not onchain, they can’t be traded and they might not turn into any tokens. Most crucially, they’re not worth anything — and maybe never will. A visual take on the emergence of points. Image: Bold Leonidas via X. Some investors also worry that points don’t have the same staying power as the lure of a potential airdrop. “Founders think \"points\" are smart and easy mode for them, locking the users in indefinitely. But that\u0027s not true; in fact, it\u0027s the opposite. Users cannot be everywhere at once, and their attention gets diluted,” said Long Solitude, a pseudonymous investor at VC firm Zee Prime Capital, on X. KVK, a pseudonymous investor director at VC firm HASH CIB, concurred that users have a short attention span and noted that most point programs lack a clear end date, making it worse. “In a world where there is a protocol with a new point-based system every day, it is super hard to stay relevant over time,” they said in a Substack post devoted to points. “Attention is one of the critical ingredients for success, and your quasi-infinite points program (from a user’s perspective) does not help you capture it.” Out of curiosity, The Block tried to see how many points had been issued in total. As the points aren\u0027t on a blockchain, we had to download apps, check leaderboards and reach out to projects directly to get answers. In the end, we totaled up some 40.6 billion points across 12 projects — however meaningless that number is. FriendTech: Points but no airdrop FriendTech is a clear example showing why users have been disaffected by points. The project was one of the first to implement a clear points system in its app in a bid to reward engagement. Each week it would drop points based on an unspecified allocation system to its users — something that worked brilliantly until it didn’t.

Yet this quickly dwindled. Over the next three and a half months, it saw just a much slower $126 million of trading volume while the number of daily transactions collapsed. The number of daily transactions on FriendTech has significantly reduced. Image: TK research via Dune Analytics. Part of the reason is that in the beginning, traders were optimistic that the points would lead to an imminent airdrop. At the time, a pseudonymous crypto influencer known as Dingaling — who had one of the most expensive channels — said FriendTech would remain successful until the token airdrop. When the project received investment from Paradigm, this spurred hopes that one was on the way. Yet one has so far not taken place, and anyone who burned money hoping for a greater allocation has seemingly lost out. Why do VCs like points? While many retail investors complain about points, the one class of crypto investors that seem to like them is venture capitalists. One key element is that points are more flexible than token issuance, which can’t be changed on a whim. “While points can\u0027t replace product-market fit, they provide the flexibility to test assumptions without the complexities and costs associated with launching tokens,” Dmitriy Berenzon, partner at VC firm Archetype, told The Block. Multicoin Capital Partner Tushar Jain agreed that points are useful for incentives prior to a token launch. “Launching a token is a lot of work, and it’s much harder to change economics once the token is live,” he said in the firm’s outlook for 2024. A partner at VC firm Dragonfly, who goes by GM, said offering points enabled NFT marketplace Blur to fine-tune its incentives between seasons. Blur is currently on its third season of points. They added that Blur leaving some of the points criteria undisclosed helped it to avoid wash trading. Edvin Memet, a researcher at The Block Pro Research, argued that airdrops with blind criteria tend to encourage more organic use, typically leading to larger allocations. “An airdrop with blind criteria may not attract as many users pre-airdrop, but it stands out as the fairest method for rewarding genuine users. Additionally, it is the most likely system to lead to substantial airdrop allocations, which can create a lot of publicity and attract new users post-airdrop,” he said, pointing to liquid staking project Jito as an example. Memet noted that Manta’s particular point-based system enabled it to attract a higher amount of value locked in its smart contracts than it would have received otherwise. The project also kept hold of the value by auto-staking ether that was bridged to it. He said he anticipates that other Layer 1 and Layer 2 projects will employ similar systems in the future. Jain also noted that points help to avoid some of the regulatory risks seen with airdropping tokens because they don’t have value. “Points have no units, no max supply, and less regulatory risk because they are not transferable,” he said. Some VCs are aware, though, that points may not have an infinite staying power. “I see it as a new narrative, a new thing, an exciting thing in crypto, but whether it is just a temporary fad is yet to be seen,” Kavita Gupta, founder and general partner of Delta Blockchain Fund, told The Block. “We will definitely have everything continue to use point incentive systems, but I think it is more going to be about attracting customers than being able to retain them for a long time because everybody will end up giving some sort of features like this.” Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

    "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is a regulatory agency in the U.S. tasked with protecting investors, maintaining fair and efficient markets and facilitating capital formation. The SEC was established in 1934 during the Great Depression and following Congress\u0027 passage of the Securities Act of 1933, which is the first federal law that regulated the issuance of securities. The agency was created to regulate and enforce that legislation. The SEC oversees broker-dealers, investment companies, investment advisers, clearing agencies, transfer agents, credit rating agencies and securities exchanges. The agency also oversees organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The agency\u0027s jurisdiction was further expanded in 2010 following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act to include municipal advisors among others. Within the SEC The agency\u0027s leadership is made up of up to five commissioners appointed by the President based on advice and consent from the Senate. There can not be more than three commissioners in the same political party. There are also multiple divisions within the agency including ones focused on enforcement, corporation finance, economic and risk analysis, examinations, trading and markets and investment management. All play unique roles in bolstering the agency. For example, the Division of Corporation Finance makes sure investors are provided with material information to then make informed investment decisions while the Division of Enforcement investigates possible violations of the federal securities laws. The SEC\u0027s three objectives The agency is tasked with protecting investors and aims to ensure that investors have access to accurate and relevant information about securities being offered for public sale and that they are protected from fraudulent or manipulative practices. The SEC also works to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets by regulating exchanges, securities brokers, dealers, and other market participants. Lastly, the SEC plays a role in facilitating the capital-raising process for companies by overseeing the issuance of new securities and ensuring compliance with regulations.

Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton cracked down on initial coin offerings in 2017 and raised concerns that they could be offering much less investor protection than in more traditional markets which could lead to more fraud and manipulation. The current chair, Gary Gensler, has warned that crypto exchanges need to register with the agency. Over the past year, the SEC has cracked down on firms, including Coinbase and Kraken for allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, dealer and clearinghouse. The SEC also sued Binance in 2023 for similar charges along with alleging that the exchange lied to customers and misdirecting capital to separate investment funds owned by its former CEO Changpeng Zhao. Nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, have also come under the SEC\u0027s scrutiny recently. The agency brought charges against a Los Angeles-based podcasting studio Impact Theory for allegedly conducting an unregistered offering of NFTs. A month later the agency charged NFT project Stoner Cats 2 LLC with allegedly conducting an unregistered offering of NFTs. Lawmakers are working on legislation to bring clarity to how cryptocurrencies should be regulated, but none have been signed into law yet. Spot bitcoin ETF greenlight In a significant move for the crypto industry, the SEC approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in early 2024, years after Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss first filed a spot bitcoin ETF application with the agency back in 2013. A turning point for the SEC\u0027s eventual approval was a pivotal ruling during the summer of 2023 when a panel of judges mandated the SEC to re-evaluate Grayscale Investments\u0027 proposal for a spot bitcoin ETF. The court specifically addressed the SEC\u0027s treatment of spot bitcoin ETFs and bitcoin futures ETFs in their opinion. Prior to its approval, Grayscale showed in its proposed bitcoin ETF that it was similar to already approved bitcoin futures ETFs in both the underlying assets and in surveillance sharing agreements. It should have \"the same likelihood of detecting fraudulent or manipulative conduct in the market for bitcoin and bitcoin futures,\" the court said at the time. The SEC approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs from companies including BlackRock and Fidelity, though the agency\u0027s Chair Gensler noted that it did not mean the agency was endorsing bitcoin. That approval provided institutional and retail investors with a way to get exposure to bitcoin through more traditional investment channels. Since then, spot bitcoin ETFs have seen billions of dollars of inflows. The SEC has not yet approved any spot Ethereum ETFs.

    "content": "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright stopped appealing his 2022 loss of a defamation case in Norway, which was related to his claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. The appeal was against Magnus Granath, a Norwegian citizen who goes by \"Hodlonaut,\" who published harsh words against Wright on Twitter (now X). In 2022, a Norwegian judge sided with Granath about his word choices and other written statements against Wright — a decision Wright sought to appeal. \"Just got off the phone with my Norwegian lawyer,\" Granath announced on social media. \"My win from 2022 is now final and enforceable. This case started May 19th, 2019 and lasted until today. I’m very happy! Now I just need to get the UK case dismissed/won and I can finally move on.\" Wright issued a suit against Granath in May 2019 in Norway for libel, or written and defamatory comments aimed at harming someone\u0027s reputation. \"I’m very happy that my win in Norway is now final, and that five years of work has come to a conclusion here,\" Granath told The Block. \"I am waiting to celebrate until the UK case is gone too.\" The Block reached out to Wright\u0027s Norwegian lawyer and will update the story upon response.

In May 2019, Granath posted on Twitter that Wright is a \"fraud,\" claimed he enacted \"scams\" and even created the hashtag \"#CraigWrightIsaFraud.\" Wright and his team asked Granath to take down the claims and issue a public apology stating, \"I was wrong to allege Craig Wright fraudulently claimed to be Satoshi. I accept he is Satoshi. I am sorry Dr Wright. I will not repeat this libel.\" On May 19, 2019, Granath brought a suit hoping to find judgment that his tweets were lawful in the Oslo District Court. Wright issued a counterclaim in Norway stating the tweets were libel. Wright also issued a defamation case against Granath in a UK court in the summer of 2019, which attempted to narrow the recovery of harm damages of Granath\u0027s tweets to England and Wales. Three years later, a Norwegian judge ruled Granath had evidence-based reasons to use \"scam\" and \"fraud\" related to Wright, as well as to doubt whether he is Nakamoto, CoinDesk reported at the time. Wright appealed the decision a month later. In March 2024, a UK court ruled Wright is not Nakamoto and could not issue copyright claims related to the Bitcoin network, The Block previously reported.

    "content": "The relative tepid flow of venture capital funding into the crypto industry this year, despite the recent crypto market resurgence, presents a downside risk, according to JPMorgan analysts. \"Our various proxies for crypto VC flows look rather subdued YTD [year to date] relative to previous years,\" JPMorgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, wrote in a report on Thursday. \"We had previously argued that a recovery in crypto VC flows is a necessary condition for a sustained recovery in crypto markets, so in our minds, the subdued VC flows YTD pose a downside risk.\" Venture capital funding in the crypto sector has picked up momentum so far this year, yet it continues to lag behind previous years. The Block Pro\u0027s Deals Dashboard shows that the crypto industry has attracted $3.2 billion in VC investment year-to-date, compared to over $4 billion in the first four months of last year. However, more venture capital firms are raising or have raised new funds amid the crypto market rebound this year. Earlier this month, 1kx raised $75 million to back early-stage crypto startups. Paradigm is reportedly in talks to raise between $750 million and $850 million for a new fund. Galaxy Digital, Hack VC and Hivemind Capital are also reportedly raising $100 million, $100 million, and $50 million for their new funds, respectively. Crypto accelerator Alliance had the first close of its third fund in February, receiving $10 million each from Brevan Howard Digital and Galaxy Digital, and is looking to raise an additional $80 million by July. While VC funding appears to be slowly reviving, crypto hedge funds are more active this year, and their assets under management have increased sharply over the past six months, estimated at around $20 billion, the JPMorgan analysts said. RELATED INDICES See crypto indices Spot Ethereum ETF approval The JPMorgan analysts reiterated in Thursday\u0027s report that there is no more than a 50% chance of spot Ethereum ETH -1.26% exchange-traded fund approval in May, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will eventually approve such funds. \"Following the SEC investigation of the Ethereum Foundation, the optimism for spot Ethereum ETF approval by May 23rd appears to be also fading in market pricing as seen by the discount to NAV [net asset value] for the Grayscale Ethereum trust, which widened from 8% to 22% over the past month,\" the analysts concluded.

    "content": "The crypto community erupted into panic over the weekend amid incorrect reports that the EU was banning anonymous crypto wallets and self-custodial payments. The reports seemingly misinterpreted comments from Patrick Breyer, a member of the European Parliament, on Thursday, confirming its economic and monetary policy committee\u0027s approval of the new EU Anti Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR) and its final text. The misinformation went viral, warning that “payments to self-custody bitcoin and crypto wallets are now illegal.” However, others were quick to respond to the overreaction. “This needs to be taken seriously but, as always, it\u0027s crucial to read the text of the actual legislation. TLDR self-custody is not illegal,” Freddie New, Head of Policy at Bitcoin Policy UK, said. “Fake news isn\u0027t it? I read the article and it says if you\u0027re hosting wallets for other people they need KYC (which is the same in America),” crypto influencer Jordan Fish, aka Cobie, added. “Seems maybe they\u0027re also ‘banning’ you sending from a CEX to self-hosted without identifying who it is. But since self-custody to self-custody is unaffected, and self-custody still allowed, just withdraw from CEX to your own self-custody?” Circle’s EU Strategy and Policy Director Patrick Hansen also moved to swiftly debunk the reports. “Self custody wallets are not banned. Payments to/from self custody wallets are not banned. P2P transfers are explicitly excluded from AMLR, as are self custody software and hardware wallets,” he said. “However, paying with crypto (for example to merchants) with a non KYC’d self custody wallet will be more difficult/banned depending on the merchants set up. This change, as well as the lower thresholds for anonymous cash payments, has unfortunately been agreed months ago,” he added. So, what does the AMLR actually mean for crypto in the EU? Hansen explained that the AMLR is not a crypto regulation — it is a broad anti-money laundering/counter-terrorist financing framework that applies to institutions classified as “obliged entities” or “OEs.” These include all financial institutions, as well as the so-called “CASPs” (crypto-asset service providers), but also other institutions like gambling services that could be prone to AML/CFT risk. However, the AMLR explicitly excludes providers of hardware and software, like Ledger, as well as self-custody wallets, like MetaMask, that do not have access to or control over users’ crypto assets. All CASPs, such as centralized crypto exchanges and custodial wallet providers regulated under Markets in Crypto-Assets legislation (MiCA), will need to follow standard KYC/AML procedures like customer due diligence. Yet they are already subject to these obligations under current AMLD5 legislation, Hansen explained. MiCA is a regulatory framework proposed by the European Union to govern digital assets and their markets that came into force in June 2023 and will be fully applicable from Dec. 30, 2024. “The AMLR (Art. 58) now explicitly prohibits CASPs to provide anonymous accounts, meaning a custodial crypto business cannot provide services for anonymous users. This is already prohibited under existing AML rules anyway, so nothing new,” Hansen said. However, others warned, this could impact non-KYC custodial Bitcoin Lightning wallets like Wallet of Satoshi. Additionally, CASPs will not be able to provide accounts for privacy coins, though such practice is already widespread, and MiCA already prohibits crypto assets with built-in anonymization.

It brings the transactions in line with the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR), the EU\u0027s implementation of the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) travel rule, but this is nothing new either, Hansen added. Regarding merchant payments, AMLR also limits cash payments to €10,000 ($10,830). There are no restrictions on using self-custodial wallets for buying goods or services in the EU. However, should customers want to use a CASP such as BitPay to buy goods or services with crypto, the CASP will need to verify users’ identity and implement additional KYC/AML measures if the transaction (single or combined) is worth more than €1,000 ($1,083). Not fully enforced for three years and it could have been worse “The AMLR is not a ban of self-custody payments, self-custody wallets or P2P transfers,\" Hansen concluded. “It mostly reiterates AML/CFT rules for CASPs and other OEs, but for the most part, these rules were already mandatory and common business practice anyway (from AMLD5, MiCA, TFR).” It also could have been worse, with Hansen describing the final version as a “great outcome” for the crypto industry. “Previous versions of the proposed AMLR proposed a way stricter approach that would have meant a KYC on the self-custody originator/beneficiary, but also thanks to industry efforts a risk-based approach with various options was finally agreed on.” Parliament proposed limiting merchant payments from a self-custody wallet to €1,000, which was removed from the final version. It also previously proposed including DAOs, DeFi, NFT platforms and even developers under AMLR’s scope, Hansen said, arguing the impact from the legislation would now be “extremely limited.” The approved AMLR text only needs to pass final, purely formal, approval in the European Parliament, likely at the end of April, and in the Council of the EU. It would then enter application three years after publication, around summer 2027, according to Hansen. EU markets watchdog moves closer to finalizing rules under MiCA The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) advanced its efforts to implement the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation by publishing its first report and launching a third consultation on Monday. The report outlines draft requirements for firms seeking authorization under MiCA, aiming to standardize the regulatory landscape for crypto assets within the EU. Additionally, the ESMA seeks feedback on rules to combat market abuse and ensure proper service delivery in the crypto sector, with the MiCA framework set to be fully enforced by December.

    "content": "As the BTC halving event gets closer, Bitcoin’s market behavior is becoming more unpredictable. Even though it went up and down a lot last month, BTC has now gone over $72,000 again, and it looks like it might jump much higher soon after the halving. Crypto investors are searching for new tokens that weren’t slowed by the recent downturn and could lead to significant gains in the coming weeks. Many experts have pointed out three emerging players—Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20), Slothana ($SLOTH), and Sponge V2 ($SPONGE), suggesting they could see gains in the 100-150x range. Let’s dig into the specifics and discover exactly what they bring to the table. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet the Best Presale Coin Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Bitcoin Going Through Big Price Changes Ahead of Halving – But No Matter How It Performs, These Three New Tokens Are Prime for a Bull Run Bitcoin (BTC) recently surged past $72,000 ahead of the upcoming reward halving event scheduled for April 20th. This price increase provided a boost to some projects, while the broader crypto market remained relatively stable. Bitcoin rose 8% over the past two weeks, reaching its highest level since March 14th. Typically, Bitcoin has seen price rallies after the halving events rather than before them, making this pre-halving rally unusual. The halving refers to when the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks gets cut in half. Currently, miners receive 6.25 BTC per block mined. After the halving, that reward will drop to 3.125 BTC per block. Reducing the mining rewards slows the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation. Historically, these supply shocks from halving events have preceded bull markets for Bitcoin, as reduced supply puts upward pressure on prices. Open interest in Bitcoin futures hit record highs above $25 billion recently, suggesting that many investors are gearing up for big changes in the market caused by the halving event. While some analysts think this rally could continue towards $100,000, others view it as unsustainable and expect a “sell-the-news” event after the halving. Regardless of Bitcoin’s moves, a few smaller crypto projects positioned themselves to outperform the larger players and bring significant gains — Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20), Slothana ($SLOTH), and Sponge V2 ($SPONGE). \u003e\u003e\u003eGet the Best Presale Coin Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) Gears Up for Launch – A New Eco-Friendly Crypto with $10M in Early Investment Set for Significant Growth Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) is a new crypto project inspired by the popular meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE). It is set to launch on the upcoming Doge Day, April 20th. Compared to many established cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin20 will have a relatively small initial market capitalization. A lower starting market cap could potentially allow early investors to see larger percentage gains when the project grows over time. The $DOGE20 presale has already raised over $10 million from investors attracted by its environmentally-friendly proof-of-stake model and staking rewards. However, the presale period is closing soon and will end on Doge Day. A key feature is the ability for token holders to earn staking rewards, generating a passive income stream by holding their $DOGE20 tokens in a crypto wallet. The projected annual staking reward rate is 52% for the first couple years after launch, providing additional motivation for early adoption. Unlike cryptos using energy-intensive proof-of-work mining, Dogecoin20 is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum using a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This is designed to reduce the environmental impact by removing the need for power-hungry mining rigs. As environmental sustainability grows in importance, $DOGE20’s eco-friendly consensus model could appeal to conscious crypto investors. Combined with its staking rewards and low initial market cap, it aims to attract investors seeking potential for major profit. The current Dogecoin20 presale price is just $0.00022 per token, establishing a relatively low entry point before the upcoming launch and price surge. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet Dogecoin20 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Slothana ($SLOTH) Surges on Solana – $10M Presale Success as Investors Rush to Secure Their Tokens Slothana ($SLOTH) is a new crypto project built on the Solana blockchain that has rapidly raised over $10 million in its presale. This significant early fundraising highlights Slothana’s arrival as a notable new player within the Solana ecosystem. Many crypto projects are now building on Solana instead of Ethereum due to Solana’s faster transaction speeds and greater scaling potential. $SLOTH’s choice to use Solana’s blockchain aligns with this emerging trend of exploring alternatives to Ethereum. One unique aspect of $SLOTH is its simplified presale investment process. Rather than having multiple rounds, investors can directly exchange their SOL tokens for $SLOTH tokens at a fixed rate of 10,000 $SLOTH per SOL. This streamlined approach avoids the complexities often seen in other crypto presales. There are certain rumors that Slothana’s team may also be responsible for Smog ($SMOG), a previous Solana project that delivered 30x gains for early investors. While speculative, this potential connection has generated buzz around $SLOTH. The timing of $SLOTH’s launch matches with the annual “Doge Day” celebrating Dogecoin and meme coins, likely boosting its initial popularity among investors interested in meme-themed crypto projects. Moving forward. $SLOTH aims to build on its successful presale fundraising and rapidly growing community interest. However, the presale window is closing soon, so investors looking to participate should act quickly before the opportunity passes. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet Slothana Now\u003c\u003c\u003c SPONGE V2 ($SPONGE) — New Play-to-Earn Game and Attractive Staking Rewards Bring Potential for Major Gains SPONGE V2 ($SPONGE) is an updated version of the original $SPONGE meme crypto token. The previous $SPONGE token achieved significant success, reaching a market capitalization of $100 million and providing early investors with 100x returns on their investment. One of the new features introduced in $SPONGE V2 is a Play-to-Earn game inspired by the popular SpongeBob SquarePants animated series. This game element aims to increase user engagement and interaction with the project’s meme-based theme. As an incentive for long-term holders, investors who lock up their original Sponge V1 tokens for an extended period will receive four years’ worth of staking rewards in the form of $SPONGE V2 tokens. This reward system is designed to reward early adoption and encourage long-term participation. The process for transitioning from the original $SPONGE token to Sponge V2 involves a “bridging” mechanism detailed in the project’s whitepaper, allowing V1 token holders to migrate their holdings to the new V2 version. The upcoming $SPONGE V2 token sale presents an investment opportunity with clear incentives such as staking rewards. Given the original $SPONGE token’s success in achieving a 100x price increase, some investors may view Sponge V2 as having potential for similar gains in the meme coin market segment. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet Sponge V2 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Conclusion With the BTC halving on the horizon, Bitcoin has seen significant price changes recently, but ultimately returned to over $72,000. Market uncertainty has investors searching for new opportunities, looking for tokens that weren’t slowed down by the recent downturn in the market. Numerous experts are recommending these three new meme coins as prime candidates for significant growth and explosive performance in the weeks ahead — Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20), Slothana ($SLOTH), and Sponge V2 ($SPONGE). The interest in their presales indicates their potential for significant returns, with predictions suggesting possible gains in the 100-150x range.

    "content": "With Bitcoin ripping higher and closing in on breaking all-time highs, one analyst on X thinks $150,000 post-halving is “programmed.” The analyst remains upbeat in a post, highlighting several fundamental developments that could drive the world’s most valuable coin to new valuation and more than 2X from spot rates. Currently, the path of least resistance remains northward. Buyers have shaken off the bears of the past trading month, finding anchor from the March 20 bull bar. On April 8, the coin soared above the key liquidation level at around $71,800. Bitcoin has since cooled off, but the leg up remains, and it may form the basis of another breakout above $74,000. Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView For bulls to be firmly in control and align with the analyst’s outlook, there should be a follow-through of the April 8 surge, ideally with rising trading volumes. This could catalyze demand, even placing Bitcoin above $74,000 and fresh 2024 highs before the highly anticipated Halving event. Eyes On Bitcoin Halving: A Supply Squeeze In The Making? As the analyst explains, the “Halving” event is a crucial catalyst for this potential surge. Less than ten days away, this event is a protocol-driven occurrence that will see the network reduce block rewards to 3.125 BTC, down from the current 6.25 BTC. Related Reading: Filecoin Bull Run On The Horizon? Analyst Sees 250% Surge This reduction, combined with sustained demand, will likely create a scarcity of Bitcoin, potentially driving up its price. Bitcoin halving countdown | Source: Coinwarz Ahead of Bitcoin’s Halving, the analyst said the amount of BTC held by exchanges is dwindling. To illustrate, Coinbase’s holdings stand at a six-year low. However, this is not an isolated event; data shows that major exchanges like Binance are seeing decreasing supply. At the same time, over-the-counter (OTC) desks, which handle large, private cryptocurrency transactions, are reportedly running low on Bitcoin, indicating strong institutional demand. This suggests a potential supply squeeze set to only worsen in the coming months. Impact Of Spot BTC ETFs: London, Hong Kong In The Picture Already, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) issuers, the analyst added, are on a buying spree, gobbling up over $300 million of BTC every day. Since these issuers are acting on behalf of investors, both retail and institutions, they are actively infusing capital into the market, a huge boost for prices. It should be noted that the surge from Q4 2023 to early January was primarily because of the anticipated spot Bitcoin ETFs. The spillover effect and the billions flowing into the asset make BTC more liquid and resilient against aggressive sellers.

Like the spot ETFs in the United States, this product will inject liquidity into the market and legitimize the coin as a worthy asset class, similar to gold.

    "content": "The Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross indicator attained overheated values coinciding with the recent local top in the price. Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Surged To 3.17 During Recent Peak An analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained that the NVT Golden Cross may have served as an indicator of the recent top in cryptocurrency prices. The “NVT” refers to an on-chain metric that tracks the ratio between Bitcoin’s market cap and transaction volume (both in USD). This ratio is generally used to determine whether the asset’s price is fair or not. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Capitulate: $5.2 Billion Sold At Loss When the indicator has a high value, the asset’s price (the market cap) is high compared to its utility (the transaction volume). Such a trend may suggest that the coin could be overvalued currently. On the other hand, the low metric could suggest the network isn’t valued fairly compared to its high ability to transact capital, and as such, its price may be due to an uplift. In the context of the current discussion, the NVT itself isn’t interesting, but rather, a modified version called the NVT Golden Cross is. This metric compares the short-term trend of the NVT (10-day moving average) against its long-term trend (30-day MA). Like the NVT, this variant is also used to estimate the fairness of the asset. Historically, values greater than 2.2 have been a signal that BTC is overheated, as the short-term trend is notably outpacing the long-term at these levels. Similarly, values under the -1.6 level may indicate that the cryptocurrency is undervalued; hence, its price may likely form a bottom and find a rebound soon. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross rose to relatively high levels earlier. This growth happened as the asset’s price rallied towards the $71,000 level. The metric had touched the 3.17 mark in this surge, which suggests the coin may have become too overpriced. Indeed, the asset followed this by observing a sharp drawdown, which took it back under the $65,000 level. As the quant has marked in the chart, a similar pattern of the NVT Golden Cross hitting these high levels and resulting in a price correction was observed at different points over the last few years.

    "content": "Amidst the recent market retracement, notable crypto enthusiast and YouTuber Jeremy DaVinci has sparked optimism in the Bitcoin community. DaVinci’s analysis revolves around a technical indicator, the Bollinger Bands, suggesting a potential rally in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Where Are We Headed To?

Drawing from past occurrences, DaVinci hints at the possibility of Bitcoin’s price doubling within three months following this setup.

Tapiero, known for his investment insights and founding roles in Gold Bullion International and 10T Holdings, highlighted a significant macroeconomic factor that drives Bitcoin’s potential ascent. According to Tapiero, the observed correlation in the market points to concerns regarding “monetary debasement” fueled by a substantial increase in the Treasury market over the past five years. Tapiero’s bullish stance centers on the unique scarcity of Bitcoin as a digital asset, emphasizing its potential to outperform traditional assets like gold.

    "content": "Shiba Inu has achieved a significant milestone by surpassing 4 million addresses. This feat marks a historic moment for the token, symbolizing its growing popularity within the digital asset community. Analysis of address metrics on Glassnode reveals a steady uptrend in Shiba Inu’s address count over the past few months, culminating in this impressive milestone. Related Reading: Uniswap Bloodbath: UNI Price Crashes 16% On SEC Lawsuit Fears Address Growth Signals Potential, But Activity Paints A Different Picture While the increase in total addresses may initially appear promising, a closer examination of Shiba Inu’s activity metrics paints a contrasting picture. Despite the surge in address count, the number of active addresses has experienced a notable decline from previous highs. This discrepancy suggests that while there is a growing number of addresses associated with Shiba Inu, the level of actual activity within the network remains relatively low. Source: Glassnode Furthermore, the analysis of new addresses follows a similar downward trajectory, indicating a decrease in the rate of adoption or interest in the token. These trends raise questions about the sustainability of Shiba Inu’s growth and its ability to maintain momentum in the highly competitive cryptocurrency market. Shiba Inu Price Action Stagnates Amidst Uncertainty Against this backdrop of mixed signals, Shiba Inu’s price action has experienced a period of stagnation. Although there was a notable spike in price around March 5th, coinciding with increased address activity, the token has since struggled to maintain momentum. Currently trading around $0.000027, Shiba Inu’s price reflects a lack of clear directional bias, signaling uncertainty among investors and traders. Shiba Inu is now trading at $0.000027. Chart: TradingView Analysts attribute Shiba Inu’s stagnant price movements to a combination of factors, notably including prevailing sentiments across the cryptocurrency market and a lack of significant developments specific to the token. Despite its widespread recognition and community support, Shiba Inu’s valuation remains susceptible to external influences and market dynamics, indicative of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Related Reading: CEO Throws Cold Water On May Ethereum ETF Approval – Impact On Price While Shiba Inu enjoys a dedicated following, its price trajectory underscores the importance of monitoring both internal and external catalysts that could impact its valuation. Analysts caution investors to exercise prudence and recognize the nuanced relationship between Shiba Inu’s price and the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics. Trading Volume Indicates Stability Amidst Fluctuations Meanwhile, in addition to price action, the trading volume for Shiba Inu has remained relatively stable in recent times. With trading activity hovering around $527 million, there have been no significant spikes or declines observed in the near term. This stability suggests that while the overall market sentiment may be uncertain, there is still a consistent level of interest and participation in Shiba Inu trading activities.

As part of his analysis, he highlighted certain factors that could contribute to the meme coin experiencing this parabolic price surge. Shiba Inu To Rise To $0.0001 If History Repeats Itself Crypto analyst Bunchhieng suggested in his analysis that SHIB could attain such a price level if history were to repeat itself, and SHIB mirrors its bullish pattern from the 2021 bull run. He affirmed that based on the patterns that he observed from the previous bull market, it was “quite possible” for SHIB to hit $0.0001. Related Reading: Crypto Experts Predict Massive Price Surge For XRP Price, Is $20 Possible? Source: Tradingview.com The analyst also tried to clear the doubts of those who believe that such a price surge isn’t likely considering SHIB’s market cap, stating that anything was possible in the crypto world. Meanwhile, he added the SHIB burn rate, which has continued to increase exponentially, as another factor that could have a “positive effect” on the meme coin’s value. Bunchhieng’s price prediction also looks feasible when one considers crypto analyst Rekt Capital’s recent analysis, in which he suggested that SHIB was already mirroring its price action from 2021. Back then, he revealed that SHIB, similar to 2021, had successfully retested the $0.000026041 price as a new support level. In a more recent update, Rekt Capital also suggested that SHIB was showing enough strength to make a similar run to the one in 2021, stating that SHIB’s current support level served as resistance for the meme coin in early 2022. SHIB Could Indeed Hit $0.0001 Bunchhieng isn’t the only crypto analyst who believes that SHIB can hit $0.0001. Crypto analyst Javon Marks also predicted that the meme coin could rise to $0.0001553 once it hits the $0.000081 price range. Interestingly, these aren’t even the most bullish predictions for Shiba Inu. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Halving Influence Is No Longer Driving Price, Here’s What Is Crypto analyst Armando Pantoja, who recently outlined his price targets for different crypto tokens, predicted that the meme coin could rise to $0.001 after the Bitcoin Halving. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicted that SHIB could rise to $0.011, although he didn’t give a specific timeline for when this unprecedented price surge will occur. Despite the varying price predictions, it is, however, clear that SHIB is more than likely to hit a new all-time high (ATH) in this bull run. Pseudonymous crypto analyst and trader Xanrox believes this could happen as soon as July, predicting that the crypto token would rise to $0.00008854 by then.

    "content": "With so many different casino sites now available to pick and choose from, finding the right one can be overwhelming. Thankfully, there are a few things that players can keep an eye on when looking for a new one to consider, with those who like to use cryptocurrency also now able to find some of their own advantages that may not be possible to experience with some of the more traditional sites that are in the market. Cryptocurrency has boomed in recent years and has become a preferred option for players worldwide. Although many may associate virtual currency with the peaks and troughs that can be experienced in terms of its price, value and the volatility that can be witnessed, those who have a little detailed knowledge about the wider benefits that can be enjoyed have started to understand just how advantageous they can be when applied to casino gaming. As a result, finding the right casino site has become even more important than ever for all types of players, regardless of the payment method that they prefer to use. While this is a vital aspect that needs to be considered, it’s also worth recognizing that sites can offer differences in terms of the overall security offered, the collection of games and types that build their portfolios, as well as the bonuses and promotions that might be offered to entice an individual to join them over another site that is available. Look at reviews and consider previous feedback The very first port of call for any player who is looking to find the right online casino and enjoy a positive experience should be to look at any reviews that have been left by their peers or experts across the iGaming industry. Reviews left by these individuals can typically be trusted as they will usually want others to know about their own personal experiences and give an insight into what can be expected. They are not being incentivized to leave positive remarks, and where they deem things are not quite right, they aren’t usually afraid to share their criticisms. Additionally, reviews can be a great way to gauge an overview of what to expect, as multiple reviews suggesting the same thing can be taken as a good yardstick. Security features and licenses need to be considered Cryptocurrency’s boom as a popular form of payment for casino gaming arguably stems from the security features that it contains. Compared to traditional fiat currency, there are so many more advantages and benefits that can be obtained, through the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts. These technologies encrypt the transaction from start to end, but they make it transparent and keep the users of the transaction anonymous. Virtual currency can also be used to create provably fair gaming, which means players can ensure the games that are being offered are not rigged, as their randomness can be checked. In terms of security, aside from using crypto, players should identify the security measures that are in place. A good place to start would be to check the type of gambling license that is offered. This will be a good indicator of what protocols are in place, as they require certain standards to be met. Elsewhere, it’s important to look at the security features that can be easily spotted, such as the encryption technologies that may be used on each web page visited (the padlock in the URL address bar), as well as those used when making a financial transaction or the security measures that are needed when logging in. Games being offered The best casino sites will offer thousands upon thousands of games to pick and choose from. Before signing up, a prospective player should look at the library that is offered and go through each of the categories to determine whether it is right for their gaming experiences. In doing so, you’ll know what to expect as you’ll be able to see which software providers are on board, as well as the quantities of game types. For instance, if you have a preference for high-paying slot games, then you may want to check out whether Megaways or Jackpot titles are available. If there are, it would be a good idea to know how many, as this can help to prolong and increase the experiences that are obtained from the chosen site. For crypto players, it’s worth taking a look at whether Crash games are available, in addition to traditional casino games that allow crypto payments, including the use of altcoins, as these will further enhance any experience. Looking at bonuses and promotions Everyone wants to get as much as they can for their money to improve satisfaction with their spend, and the best way to achieve this with casino gaming is to make the most of the bonuses and promotions that are offered. These can be the main way in which casinos diversify themselves and separate from the crowded pack. Players should do as much research regarding each bonus being offered (looking at T\u0026Cs, etc.) and determine what they want to experience. Not all bonuses are the same, but they can each have a significant impact on how a casino is enjoyed. A lot about finding the right casino can be about the benefits that can be enjoyed. Final Thoughts There are so many different things that need to be considered when trying to find the right casino site, especially as there are so many available to choose from. If you want to use cryptocurrency, then there are some things that need to be thought of specifically, but many of those also apply to those using fiat currencies.

This adjustment, recorded at 86.4 trillion, marks a crucial milestone in the cryptocurrency’s history.

This surge in hash rate underscores the growing interest and investment in Bitcoin mining infrastructure, highlighting miners’ commitment to secure the network and reap rewards amidst the evolving landscape of crypto mining.

The impending Halving event will see block subsidy rewards reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, potentially impacting miner revenues and the overall network dynamics. Despite these uncertainties, as the halving event draws nearer, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, maintaining its upward trajectory. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has surged approximately 2.5%, with a 1.5% increase in the last 24 hours alone. BTC price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart.

Amidst these slight positive price movements and the impending Halving, Bitcoin enthusiasts and analysts have continued to express optimism, instilling confidence in investors and traders awaiting a potential BTC price spike.

    "content": "On-chain data shows Bitcoin has been going through a “euphoria wave” for two months. Here’s how long it was in this phase during the last bull run. Bitcoin Has Been In Euphoria Wave Phase According To Supply In Profit According to the latest weekly report from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the current BTC cycle is similar to the last one regarding the “Supply Profitability State.” This indicator is based on the “Percent Supply in Profit,” which keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that’s currently carrying a profit. Related Reading: Dogecoin Slows Down: What Needs To Happen For New DOGE Highs? This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see the price at which it was last transferred. Assuming that this last transaction was the last point at which it changed hands, the price at its time would reflect the coin’s current cost basis. Naturally, if this cost basis is lower in value than the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, then the coin in question carries some net unrealized gain. The Percent Supply in Profit adds up all such coins and calculates what percentage of the supply they make up for. The supply Profitability State signals BTC’s current phase based on the market’s profitability status. The chart below shows the trend in this indicator over the past few years. Looks like the metric has been giving a green signal in recent weeks | Source: Glassnode\u0027s The Week Onchain - Week 15, 2024 In the chart, the analytics firm has highlighted three important lines for the Bitcoin Percent Supply in Profit. The middle line (colored in blue) represents the cumulative mean of the metric, while the other two signify +1 (green) and -1 (red) standard deviation (SD) from this mean. When the Bitcoin Percent Supply in Profit is above the +1SD (approximately 95% of the supply being in the green), the market may be considered to be in the euphoria or pre-euphoria phase. Similarly, the Supply Profitability State would indicate a bottom discovery phase for values less than -1SD. The zone between these two corresponds to the “bear/bull transition” phase. From the chart, it’s visible that during the last bull run, Bitcoin first saw a 1.5-month-long pre-euphoria wave, during which the metric tested the +1SD line. The asset followed up with a period of decline and consolidation, which put the Supply In Profit back under the +1 SD mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Two Important On-Chain Levels: What Happened Last Time Finally, the coin observed a sharp rally, broke past the +1SD barrier, and went on to achieve new all-time highs, which naturally set the Supply In Profit to 100%. Bitcoin seems to have witnessed a similar pattern this time around. A two-month-long pre-euphoria phase was followed by a drawdown, which has now been succeeded by a two-month-long euphoria wave during which the cryptocurrency has achieved new records. If the euphoria wave lasts for a period similar to the last bull run, then four or more months might still be left for this Bitcoin bull rally.

    "content": "The Bitcoin Halving is almost here, bringing about the most significant event in the Cryptocurrency market ever. Each event has had a dramatic impact on supply, demand, and price appreciation post-halving. But with Bitcoin price already setting a new all-time high before the halving for the first time ever, how might this change post-halving performance? Let’s take a closer look. What is the Bitcoin Halving? The Bitcoin Halving is a recurring event happening approximately every four years. By design, it is intended to increase the scarcity of BTC and strengthen the security of the network. However, it has the unintended effect of bringing more participants, speculation, and volatility to Crypto markets, driving Bitcoin price to astronomical new highs. Currently, miners unlock about 900 new BTC each day while contributing to the security of the Bitcoin network. After the next halving, this will be reduced to roughly 450 new BTC each day. This abrupt change in supply, coupled with growing demand is often an event worth paying attention to, as the following data will reveal. Past post-halving performance examined The first ever Bitcoin halving occurred on November 28, 2012. BTCUSD traded at around $10. Within one year, Bitcoin price climbed by nearly 10,000% to over $1,200 per coin. At this point, the top Cryptocurrency was still in its infancy, and few paid attention to the impact the halving had on price action. The second halving took place on July 9, 2016, some four years later. Cryptocurrencies were still relatively unknown at this point in time. However, new altcoins were starting to gain traction and the industry surrounding Bitcoin begane to develop. 16 months later, BTCUSD rallied from $570 at the July 2016 halving to just under $20,000 per coin, representing a 3,400% post-halving performance. By the third halving, which took place on May 11, 2020, the world had started to realise the correlation between BTCUSD performance and the proximity to the halving event. The halving happened just months following the COVID pandemic and unprecedented money supply expansion, resulting in a perfect storm for Bitcoin and investors. Within a year, Bitcoin soared from under $9,000 per coin to more than $65,000 per BTC. Although this is substantial in USD terms, this was only a 625% gain compared to 3,400% and 10,000% previously, setting the precedence for diminishing returns. Why the 2024 Bitcoin Halving could be different The Bitcoin Halving in 2024 is pegged for mid-April, and is already gearing up to be the most important event in Crypto history. While the phrase “this time is different” is considered the most dangerous in investing, this time, when it comes to Bitcoin, things are very different to the past. Despite the enormous bull markets that follow each halving, none of these rallies set a new all-time high beforehand. In 2024, Bitcoin has already set a new all-time high, which could either mean further diminishing performance, or a shocking rally that surprises the masses and only adds to the price tag of each BTC further. With each Bitcoin Halving, the market participants increasingly took note of its powerful impact on price appreciation. The halving is a publicly known event, and in 2024, the post-halving performance could have been front-run by so-called smart money, whales, and institutional investors, who are aware of the type of gains that are possible. Whether or not this means less performance post-halving remains to be seen. However, the reduction in new BTC available to miners should still impact the delicate balance of supply versus demand in favour of more price appreciation ahead after the event. Factors fuelling increased profit potential in Crypto The emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States are one of the major factors causing the new price record ahead of the halving, and could further ignite a bull market post halving. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been absorbing as much as 10 times the new supply from miners, and post halving this could increase to 20 times the new available supply if ETF demand remains consistent. Combined with demand from retail investors hearing about the halving in the media and in social circles, price could still rise substantially, even though Bitcoin is currently trading above former all-time highs from 2021 at $68,000 per coin.

    "content": "XRP has witnessed an alarming amount of liquidations in the last 24 hours. This has no doubt caused concerns in the XRP community, considering the impact that the derivatives market has on a crypto’s price. $1.32 Million XRP Positions Get Liquidated Data from Coinglass shows that $1.32 million has been liquidated from the XRP market in the last 24 hours. Long positions account for a majority of these liquidations, with $1.04 million in long positions being wiped out during this period. This underlines the bearish sentiment plaguing the XRP ecosystem, with the bears firmly in control. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Halving Influence Is No Longer Driving Price, Here’s What Is This bearish outlook is also evident in several other key metrics in the XRP derivatives market. For instance, the total trading volume and open interest have dropped by 36.90% and 2.69%, respectively, which suggests that crypto investors are choosing to stay out of the XRP market. Meanwhile, there has also been a decline in the options volume, further suggesting that crypto investors have reduced their bets on the the altcoin. This is, however, not surprising considering how XRP has maintained a tepid price action despite the broader crypto market enjoying significant price gains at different times. Despite XRP’s current market conditions, there are still those betting heavily on a bullish future trajectory for the crypto token. This includes crypto expert Zach Rector, who has stated that the altcoin will “not miss the bull run” despite its current price action. He alluded to XRP’s fundamentals as one reason for his belief. More recently, he mentioned that XRP will soon experience a supply shock with increased token burns on the horizon. These token burns help reduce the number of tokens in circulation and can help drive up the token’s value through scarcity. Time To Accumulate More Tokens Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto recently mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that it was time to accumulate more XRP. He made this statement while highlighting an ascending triangle on XRP’s monthly timeframe, which “screams bullish.” In anticipation of this bullish move, the analyst urged crypto investors to “accumulate more, and then just sit back and wait for the magic to happen.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Drops Trading Strategy To Profit Off Shiba Inu’s Next Leg Up Above $0.00003 As to how high XRP could rise, Egrag stated that “the measured move of the Ascending Triangle could potentially reach either $17 or $27.” The analyst had also recently claimed that the altcoin would rise to $5 by July.

    "content": "Solana (SOL) faced difficulties the past week after the network’s transaction failure rate reached over 75%. Since then, Solana’s core contributors have been working to find the congestion problems. SOL’s price tumbled 7.8%, and users seemed worried about the network’s state. Despite this, some analysts predict a more optimistic performance for SOL soon. Related Reading: Paradigm Drives $225M Funding Round For Monad Labs, Blockchain Rival To Ethereum, Solana Is Solana Poised For A Bounce? According to crypto analyst Bluntz, Solana’s drop has reached its bottom. When the news of network congestion broke, the analyst predicted that SOL’s price would likely fall to $160 before seeing a bounce. According to his chart, the performance was starting to show an ABC zig-zag pattern. At the time, the token was trading around the $184 price range, which meant that the C wave of $160 had yet to be confirmed. The analyst remained open to the “possibility of a sideways correction.” Nonetheless, he considered it “would make no sense for sol/usd to sweep down lower below 160.” On Wednesday, SOL reached a low of $162, sweeping the “A wave low.” To the analyst, this seems to be the bottom for SOL’s price despite being $2 short of his prediction. As a result, Bluntz considers that the token’s price will go “higher from here.” ABC pattern on the SOL monthly chart. Source: Bluntz Another analyst, Immortal Crypto, pointed out that SOL has shown a “good range” between $210 and $160.

Will The Network Upgrade Help SOL? In the last 24 hours, Solana’s price has risen 6%, recovering from the drop to the $162 range. Despite a 7.8% drop in the past week, the price surged 13.5% in the last 30 days.

    "content": "The better-than-expected United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) released on April 10 is already sending shock waves through the financial market. Bitcoin and most crypto assets are trading lower, extending losses recorded on April 9, weighing negatively against optimists. United States CPI Data Came In Hot According to Trading Economics data on April 10, CPI, a key economic metric for gauging inflation, rose 0.4% in March, pushing the annual inflation rate to 3.5%. Notably, this surpassed economist predictions and, most importantly, dashed hopes for the United States Federal Reserve (Fed) to slash rates aggressively this year. United States CPI data | Source: Trading Economics However, amidst the market jitters, Matt Hougan, the CIO of Bitwise Asset Management, offered a contrarian perspective as fear permeated the Bitcoin and crypto market. In a post on X, Hougan downplayed the influence of the CPI data on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Related Reading: XRP Heading To $100-$500? Analyst Provides Speculated Timeframes The executive argues that investors and traders should track other market factors like spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows and rising government deficits. In Hougan’s assessment, these can strongly influence price, even lifting Bitcoin higher since they are currently aligned. Time To Buy The Bitcoin Dip? As such, even with the fall in BTC, the drop could offer potential buying opportunities for long-term holders. Some supporters believe the “hot” CPI data only exposes the vulnerabilities of fiat currencies. This would potentially drive investors to use Bitcoin as a hedge. Moreover, this upbeat sentiment is backed by solid demand for gold, a store of value asset preferred by traditional finance investors. Analysts anticipate Bitcoin will follow a similar path as investors seek to protect value amid rising inflation. Further bolstering the bullish sentiment is the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF launch in Hong Kong before the end of April. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has been assessing various applications. Leading Chinese asset managers have submitted some. If the product is approved, it could further channel more capital to BTC, boosting inflows from the United States.

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has shown an impressive performance in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, as highlighted in a recent report by market intelligence data research firm Messari. The research firm finds key factors contributing to Bitcoin’s price increase, market cap dominance, and the emergence of new trends in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Inscription Activities Drive Bitcoin Fees Up Analyzing the key figures detailed in the report, Bitcoin’s price experienced a significant increase in Q1 2024, rising 68.78% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to reach an all-time high (ATH) of $73,100. This price increase propelled Bitcoin’s market cap dominance to 49.7% in March 2024. Interestingly, the research firm notes that such dominance is a typical feature at the start of a new halving cycle, with Bitcoin often leading the way for other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: XRP Price Drops After Massive Whale Dump, Casting Doubt On $1 Target In April BTC’s price increase QoQ. Source: Messari Another relevant figure is the inscription activity in Q4 2023, which drove fees up by 699.4% QoQ. However, in Q1 2024, subscription-related fees decreased by 41.9%. Despite declining total fees, inscription-related transactions still accounted for 18.4% of Bitcoin’s total fees, demonstrating their continued relevance. Average daily transactions and daily active addresses also experienced a decline of 15.3% and 4.7% QoQ, respectively. The report suggests that the decline in transaction activity may be attributed to decreased activity from bots or “super users.” This shift aligns with the decrease in inscription-related activities and fees. Inscription-related activity initially surged in February 2023, leading to a considerable transaction increase. Although Q1 2024 witnessed a decline in inscription-related activity QoQ, it remained significantly higher year-over-year (YoY), indicating its continued impact on the network. ETFs Amassed 212,000 BTC In Q1 Messari highlights that Q1 2024 showed the growth of programmable layers in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Established layers such as Rootstock and Stacks led the way regarding total value locked (TVL), while newer layers such as BOB and Merlin experienced rapid growth. TVL’s 127% QoQ growth was primarily in non-BTC assets, as Bitcoin-locked amounts lagged behind the Lightning Network and alt-L1 networks, which host significant amounts of BTC. Ultimately, the approval and launch of nine spot ETFs and one ETF conversion marked a significant milestone for Bitcoin’s legitimization by the US government and traditional finance (TradFi). The report notes that these ETFs garnered over $12 billion in inflows within the first month. Notably, BTC ETFs surpassed silver ETFs in assets under management (AUM) but still lagged behind gold ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs inflows during the first three months of trading.

The analyst said that historically, when Bitcoin closes two consecutive months above the upper Bollinger Band on the monthly chart, prices tend to double within three months.

Of note is that BTC prices tend to collapse before the Halving, which is set to take place in the coming weeks, dumping to as low as 20%.

A refreshing close above $74,000 might form the basis of even more gains in the days ahead, perhaps towards $100,000 in the weeks ahead. BTC might breakout | Source: Analyst on X Another analyst suggests that Bitcoin could rally to $140,000 within four weeks, especially if it follows a similar price pattern to December 2020. After breaking above the $20,000 high of 2017, Bitcoin continued to rally, peaking at around $70,000 for a nearly 3X surge. Currently, buyers are eyeing the $74,000 mark and the all-time high. If this level is surpassed, as it was in late 2020, the possibility of Bitcoin at least doubling to $140,000 becomes more likely. Will Halving, Macroeconomic Factors, And Spot ETFs Drive Prices? The current bullish sentiment might continue. Possible drivers include interest in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). So far, billions have been channeled to these products, lifting demand and thus prices. The upcoming Halving event could further buoy demand, lifting prices even higher in the coming months. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Makes Bold Prediction For Crypto Market – $5 Trillion In 2024 Beyond Bitcoin-driven fundamentals, analysts are also looking at market events, especially in the United States. Some speculate that the United States Federal Reserve (Fed) might not slash interest by at least three times this year as labor conditions become firm and inflation slows down. If the Fed reduces interest rates, reversing their hawkish outlook, BTC could lead other safe havens in an uptrend.

    "summary": "Hong Kong\u0027s SFC is poised to announce the inaugural list of four spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on April 15.\n",
    "content": "The Bitcoin price has seen a notable fluctuation, briefly surpassing $72,500 on Monday before dipping below the $70,000 threshold on Tuesday. This movement can be attributed to a risk-off sentiment among investors, largely in anticipation of the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures today. Following a low of $68,200 on Tuesday, Bitcoin managed a slight recovery, stabilizing above $69,400 at the time of reporting. Concurrently, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has updated its registry of virtual asset management funds early on April 10. Notably, the SFC is poised to announce the inaugural list of four Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on April 15, as reported by Tencent News. This announcement marks a significant milestone, setting the stage for the ETFs’ launch on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by the end of April. Despite the magnitude of this news, the immediate market reaction has been muted. Hong Kong To Launch Spot Bitcoin ETFs By End Of April According to a Tencent News report, Harvest International Asset Management and Huaxia Funds (Hong Kong) Limited have been officially approved to manage virtual assets, signaling their entry into the cryptocurrency sector in Hong Kong. This development is significant as it introduces mainland China’s leading public fund companies into Hong Kong’s virtual assets industry. Currently, there are 18 funds in Hong Kong authorized to manage cryptocurrency assets, with Harvest International and Huaxia Fund being among the first public funds to venture into this space. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Two Important On-Chain Levels: What Happened Last Time Harvest International emerged as the pioneer in submitting a proposal for a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong as of January 26. Following this initial submission, both companies have now secured the necessary qualifications to issue cryptocurrency-related fund products, including Bitcoin spot ETFs. This move enables retail investors to access these products through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The urgency to update the virtual asset management funds list stems from the SFC’s plan to unveil the first batch of Bitcoin spot ETFs by April 15. The initial batch was anticipated to include Huaxia Fund, Bosera Fund, and Value Partners Financial, alongside Harvest International. However, Bosera and Value Partners were notably absent from the updated list due to their lack of an independent responsible officer (RO) qualified in cryptocurrency asset management. These funds are reportedly collaborating with Hashkey Capital and VSFG, both qualified crypto asset management organizations.

Huaxia’s swift approval by the SFC, achieved in just two weeks, underscores the rapid pace of development in this area. The application process for a Bitcoin spot ETF in Hong Kong involves extensive collaboration with over 20 institutions, including custodian banks and market makers. Following the SFC’s approval, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is expected to spend approximately two weeks preparing for the ETF launch. Notably, this move opens up the crypto sector to Chinese retail investors, coming three months after the US SEC’s approval of the first batch of Bitcoin spot ETFs on January 11.

    "type": "The website do not provide type of article",
    "summary": "MakerDAO, responsible for issuing the DAI stablecoin, provided insights into the performance of the protocol following recent changes\n",
    "content": "In a recent announcement on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), MakerDAO, the Ethereum-based protocol responsible for issuing the DAI algorithmic stablecoin, provided insights into the performance of the Maker Protocol following recent changes. Over the past few weeks, MakerDAO has implemented significant updates to the protocol and the DAI stablecoin. Introducing the Accelerated Proposal and the direct deposit module (D3M) to Spark’s Metamorpho Vault has notably impacted the ecosystem. Increased DAI Supply And Demand Looking at key metrics that demonstrate the effects of these changes to the protocol, the DAI supply in circulation currently stands at nearly 5 billion, reflecting a growth of approximately 300 million over the past month. This growth indicates continued demand for the stablecoin. Related Reading: XRP Sees An Alarming 1,800% Surge In Liquidations, Whats Going On? On the other hand, the Dai Savings Rate has significantly increased since implementing the Accelerated Proposal. Approximately 1.54 billion DAI are currently deposited in the Dai Savings Rate, of which approximately 976 million DAI are sDAI, representing an increase of roughly 400 million DAI in deposits. The Maker Protocol’s total value locked (TVL) amounts to approximately $8.4 billion across various vault types. This TVL growth can be attributed to strategic deployments in D3M modules, significant contributions from Ethereum-based collaterals, and the integration of real-world assets. These developments have enhanced the protocol’s diversification and resilience. MakerDAO Ethereum Vaults Thrive A notable addition to the MakerDAO ecosystem is the Morpho DM3, which enables the Morpho Vault to mint DAI. Currently, the lending pool has deployed 200 million DAI. According to the protocol’s post, this allocation is projected to generate approximately 50 million in annual income for the Maker Protocol, making it the second-largest core vault in terms of annualized fees. It will play a significant role in generating revenue and contributing to the Maker Protocol’s sustainability. Among the Ethereum vault types within the MakerDAO ecosystem, the ETH-C vault stands out with the largest value locked in crypto collateral at approximately $1.88 billion. This vault generates approximately $43 million in annual fees, underscoring its importance within the Maker ecosystem and contribution to the protocol’s revenue streams. Related Reading: Cardano At Risk Of Crashing To $0.4 As Important Metrics Turn Bearish Another important component is the Spark D3M, which is supplied with around 970 million DAI. This module is projected to generate an annual income of approximately 28 million. These recent changes have positively impacted the Maker Protocol. The increase in DAI supply, growth in the Dai Savings Rate, expansion of collaterals, and introduction of different vault types have contributed to the protocol’s growth and development. The 1-D chart shows MKR’s price trending downwards over the past two weeks. Source: MKRUSD on TradingView.com Despite the growth in the MakerDAO ecosystem, the native token MKR has experienced a continuous 5.9% price decline over the past fourteen days. In the last seven days alone, the token has recorded a significant 17% price drop, resulting in its current trading price of $3,355. However, despite the price decline, Token Terminal data reveals positive trends. The protocol’s market capitalization currently stands at $3.3 billion, reflecting a notable 28% increase over the past 30 days. Additionally, trading volume for the MKR token has experienced a substantial surge, reaching $5.9 billion, representing a 119% increase over the same time frame.

    "content": "In a recent analysis, Stanislas Bernard, the founder of Sinz 21st.Capital, delved into the complexities surrounding Hong Kong’s consideration to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs against the backdrop of China’s escalating economic crisis. With the nation grappling with a record debt-to-GDP ratio of 288% in 2023, and witnessing one of the most severe housing market collapses in three decades, the financial instability has triggered an unprecedented capital flight towards overseas markets. The Perfect Timing For A Spot Bitcoin ETF? Amidst these turbulent economic times, Hong Kong’s potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs stands out as a pivotal development that could not only be a safe haven for Chinese investors but also significantly influence Bitcoin’s valuation, potentially catapulting it to the elusive $100,000 mark. China’s economic woes have been intensifying, marked by a towering debt ratio and a plummeting housing sector that has investors scrambling for alternatives. “China currently faces a significant economic downturn, exacerbated by soaring debt and malinvestments in real estate. The crisis, becoming well-known in 2021 with the default of Evergrande Group, has now spread, causing a ripple effect that will likely slow down the Chinese economy for years to come,” Bernard pointed out. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Sub $70,000 As Hong Kong Readies April-End ETF Launch This backdrop of economic instability has incited a significant shift in investor behavior, notably among Chinese investors who, faced with stringent capital controls, have sought refuge in ETFs that offer exposure to foreign markets. Yet, this avenue has been fraught with its own challenges. “Investors are paying premiums as high as 43% on certain US-focused ETFs due to quota limitations, which speaks volumes about the desperation to find safer investment harbors,” Bernard notes. Such premiums underscore the pervasive fear and uncertainty that have gripped the Chinese market, driving investors towards seemingly any available exit from the volatility of the domestic market. The Role Of Hong Kong Bernard believes that not only Hong Kongers but also Chinese mainlanders will flock to Bitcoin ETFs. “They are pretty integrated. Mainland is HK’s largest trading partner. Would not be possible to approve a spot ETF and then close it to mainland. They will enforce transaction limits instead,” the expert said. In the midst of these developments, Hong Kong’ Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is reportedly considering the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs already by the end of April, as reported yesterday. This move is viewed as a strategic effort to capture a portion of the capital flowing into Bitcoin, especially in the wake of the SEC’s approval of similar ETFs in the US, which saw a meteoric rise with $12 billion of net flow. Related Reading: Bitcoin 2 Months Through “Euphoria Wave,” How Long Was The Last One? “Hong Kong is scrambling for a change. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs could unlock a vast reservoir of stranded Chinese capital into Bitcoin, providing a much-needed life raft for investors,” Bernard explained. The anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by Hong Kong authorities has been met with significant enthusiasm within the crypto community. Influential figures such as Bitcoin Munger and Stack Hodler have been vocal about the potential impact of this development on Bitcoin’s price. “Hong Kong ETFs approval have accelerated to next week. Most accounts on CT weren’t making a big deal about them, but they are a big deal. They are going to take us to $100k+ in due time. Tick tock!” stated popular Bitcoin analyst Bitcoin Munger (@bitcoinmunger). He refers to the regional yearly year-over-year supply change from West to East. Regional yearly year-over-year supply change | Source: X @bitcoinmunger Stack Hodler (@stackhodler) further emphasized the urgency among Chinese investors to find secure investment avenues outside the traditional system, “Chinese investors were panic-buying a Gold fund at a 30% premium this month as they attempt to get their wealth into something outside the Chinese system. The approval of Hong Kong spot ETFs could be the turning point, offering a sanctioned avenue for wealth preservation amidst the crumbling real estate market.” Overall, the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong is poised to be a landmark development, not just for the region but for the global market. By offering a secure and regulated channel for investment, it could serve as a catalyst for significant capital inflow into Bitcoin, reinforcing its status as a viable store of value. “As we stand at the cusp of this historic development, the implications for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market could be profound. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong could indeed be the harbinger of a new era, potentially driving Bitcoin’s value to new heights,” concluded Bernard. At press time, BTC traded at $70,945.

    "content": "In anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event, which is expected to occur later this month, Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel believes that the price impact may already be factored into the market to a certain extent. Thiel shared his insights in a recent interview with Bloomberg, in which he discussed the potential catalysts for further price increases and their implications for the mining industry. Related Reading: From Hat To Heights: Dogwifhat’s $17 Crypto Leap Electrifie Investors Bitcoin Halving Impact Mitigated By ETF Surge? The “halving” event, a software code update that occurs approximately every four years, is often regarded as a key driver of Bitcoin’s price appreciation. The update will reduce the block reward for miners by half, meaning they will receive fewer Bitcoins as a reward for validating transactions on the blockchain. However, Thiel noted that the impact of The Halving may not be as significant this time, as the recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has already attracted substantial capital to the market. Thiel explained: The ETF approval, which has been a huge success, has attracted capital into the market and essentially brought forward what could have been the price appreciation we typically would have seen three to six months post-halving. So I think we are seeing part of that now already and that has put forward some of the demand. While the halving event is expected to reduce the daily supply of new Bitcoins by approximately 450, Thiel believes the price impact may be relatively modest. However, the Marathon CEO expressed excitement about the positive price trend leading up to the halving, stating: As miners, we are very excited to go into a halving, where for once prices have not declined prior to the halving rather prices have gone up so everybody is obviously maximizing to that. Balancing ETF Inflows And Previous Halving Patterns Thiel’s observations come amidst the noteworthy inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, which have amassed nearly $12 billion in just three months of trading in the United States. While these inflows may have contributed to the current price appreciation, historical data reveals that Bitcoin still possesses considerable growth potential leading up to The Halving. To gain a comprehensive understanding, it is crucial to examine the recent surge in Bitcoin’s value, which has soared by nearly 370% from its bear market low of $15,400 to an all-time high (ATH) of $73,700 on March 14, 2024. In conjunction with this surge, past halving events provide valuable insights into Bitcoin’s price movements and the likelihood of surpassing the significant milestone of $100,000. During the first halving in November 2012, Bitcoin’s price experienced a remarkable surge from a low of $13 to a peak of $1,152 the following year, illustrating an impressive increase of 8,753%. Similarly, the second halving event in July 2016 witnessed Bitcoin’s price ascending from $664 to a new ATH of $17,760, reflecting a surge of 2,580% after the halving. The most recent Halving event in May 2020 saw Bitcoin’s price reach a significant milestone of $67,000, surging from a low of $9,730, which accounted for a substantial increase of 593% following the halving.

Several market pundits have also set their price targets for this bull run at the coveted $100,000 level in light of the upcoming halving event. However, it remains to be seen how the price of Bitcoin will react, taking into account factors such as the influx of capital through ETFs, historical data, and potential market dynamics.

    "content": "The recent volatility in the Bitcoin (BTC) price and its struggle to consolidate above the $70,000 mark has raised questions about the sustainability of its ongoing bull run. However, market expert Charles Edwards, co-founder of Capriole Invest, believes that the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Ethena Labs (ENA) could significantly extend and boost Bitcoin’s bull market to new heights. In a recent post on social media site X (formerly Twitter), Edwards suggested that Ethena’s actions, such as constraining over-leverage in derivatives markets and reducing spot supply, can propel Bitcoin’s price higher for a longer period. Bitcoin Bull Market Boost To provide further context as to why Edwards is suggesting this possibility, on April 4th, Ethena Labs announced its intention to engage in a cash-and-carry trade involving Bitcoin. According to the protocol’s announcement, Ethena Labs can manage risk and provide a more stable backing for its product by buying and shorting Bitcoin. Related Reading: Solana Open Interest Drops $370 Million Amid Network Troubles, $200 Still Possible? One of the key factors Edwards highlights is Ethena’s ability to constrain over-leverage in Bitcoin derivatives markets. By doing so, Ethena aims to prevent excessive risk-taking and potential market instability. Additionally, Ethena’s taking spot supply off the market can reduce selling pressure, thus supporting Bitcoin’s price and prolonging the bull market. The protocol also noted that Bitcoin derivative markets offer superior scalability and liquidity compared to Ethereum (ETH). This characteristic reportedly makes Bitcoin a suitable asset for delta hedging, a risk management strategy employed by Ethena. With $25 billion of Bitcoin open interest available for Ethena to delta hedge, the capacity for its synthetic dollar product, USDe, to scale has increased significantly. Ethena Labs noted in their announcement the following: In just 1 year, BTC open interest on major exchanges (exc. CME) has grown from $10bn to $25bn, while ETH OI has grown from $5 to $10bn BTC derivative markets are growing at a faster pace than ETH and offer better scalability and liquidity for delta hedging Weighing The Risks While Edwards’ statement is optimistic about Ethena’s impact on Bitcoin’s bull market, one user raised concerns about potential downsides. Edwards acknowledges that execution risks, such as custody failure or delta neutrality failure, could have adverse effects. Edwards identifies custody risk as the most significant risk in this context. However, he highlights that any negative impacts will likely be short-lived, and market forces will ultimately dictate Ethena’s net annual percentage yield (APY). Related Reading: Bitcoin To $150,000 Is “Programmed” With Halving Approaching: Analyst In short, by limiting over-leveraging in future markets and reducing spot supply, Ethena could significantly support the price of BTC and extend the current bull run. The daily chart shows that BTC’s price has been trending downward over the past 24 hours. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Currently, BTC’s price has experienced a significant decline, plummeting to the $68,800 level. This marks a 4.3% decrease compared to Monday’s price. In parallel, Ethena’s native token, ENA, has also followed the overall downtrend of the market, reflecting BTC’s price movement with a 4% decrease. Presently, ENA is trading at $1.22.

    "content": "Bitcoin, the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, is once again on a wild ride. After a surge over the weekend that brought it close to shattering its all-time high, the digital asset has dipped back below the crucial $70,000 mark in the last 24 hours. This sudden correction has left investors wondering if the predicted surge to $80,000 is still on the table. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Polkadot Shines – Is Now The Time To Buy DOT Before $10? Bitcoin Erases Weekend Gains Just days ago, Bitcoin bulls were celebrating as the price climbed to near record highs exceeding $70,000. This bullish momentum fueled optimism, with analysts like Markus Thielen predicting a swift climb towards $80,000. However, that optimism has been tempered by the recent price drop. Bitcoin has plummeted roughly 6% from its peak, effectively erasing the gains made earlier this week. While the price has recovered slightly to hover around $69,200, it remains below the psychological barrier of $70,000. Is The $80,000 Dream Dead? The recent correction has undoubtedly dampened spirits, but some analysts are still confident that Bitcoin’s journey to $80,000 is far from over. Proponents of this view point to a few key factors that continue to fuel their bullish sentiment. Stablecoin Inflows: A Beacon Of Hope? One factor cited by Thielen is the continued strength of stablecoin inflows. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar, are often used as an entry point for investors into the crypto market. Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView According to Thielen, these robust inflows suggest sustained investor interest despite the short-term price fluctuations. Additionally, he highlights a recent technical chart pattern breakout, specifically a symmetrical triangle, as another bullish indicator. Technical analysts believe such breakouts often signal a continuation of the prior trend, which in this case would be positive for Bitcoin. On-Chain Data Bolsters Bullish Case Some analysts point to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock, which reveals significant buying support at current price levels. This data suggests that a large number of addresses (essentially unique identifiers for cryptocurrency wallets) purchased Bitcoin within the range of $68,200 and $70,325. This buying activity indicates potential resistance against further price dips, as these addresses would likely be hesitant to sell at a loss. Bitcoin price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko Bullish And Bearish Forces The current situation presents a classic tug-of-war between Bitcoin bulls and bears. While the recent price correction has shaken some confidence, strong stablecoin inflows and on-chain buying activity suggest underlying bullish pressure. However, they remain cautious, pointing to the slowdown in investments specifically targeted at spot Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) as a potential concern. These ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Source: CoinShares Meanwhile, a report by CoinShares, a digital asset manager, highlights a significant decrease in inflows to such ETFs in recent weeks, suggesting that some institutional investors might be adopting a wait-and-see approach.

    "content": "The recent ratio between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices suggests a potential decline in risk appetite within the crypto market. The ratio has reached its highest level since April 2021, indicating a stronger demand for Bitcoin than its smaller rival, Ethereum. This development has led crypto asset trading firm QCP Capital to speculate that this shift in the ratio could be an early indication of a transition from “fear of missing out” (FOMO) to outright fear. Bitcoin And Ethereum Performance Regarding recent market trends, the second quarter of 2024 has begun with relatively subdued activity. Bitcoin’s price has dipped below the $70,000 mark and has remained range-bound between $65,000 and $68,000 for the past few days despite briefly touching the $70,000 mark on Monday. Related Reading: XRP To $20 And Ethereum To $20,000: Crypto Analyst Reveals When This Will Happen According to QCP’s analysis, the inflow of funds into the spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) market has not been substantial enough to drive significant price movements in either direction. As a result, the company has observed that funding rates have stabilized, and the front end of the forward curve has declined from previous highs of 50% to less than 20% currently. Interestingly, while the front end of the forward curve has decreased, the back end remains elevated. This has led to interest in rolling spot-forward basis positions further out, potentially driven by the continued demand for long-dated Bitcoin calls extending into 2025. The daily chart shows that ETHBTC’s ratio is below the 0.50 level. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com On the other hand, Ethereum’s performance has been relatively weak. QCP also notes that the ETHBTC ratio cross-tests a critical support level after breaking below 0.05. Notably, there has been sustained selling of Ethereum calls, resulting in lower volatility and downward pressure on the price. Ultimately, QCP finds that these developments are prompting speculation as to whether this could be an early sign of FOMO turning into fear, particularly about Ethereum’s role as a proxy for altcoins. While Bitcoin may find support from topside demand and ETF inflows, Ethereum’s performance and its impact on altcoins will be important factors to watch closely. Will BTC Experience A Double-Top? Renowned crypto analyst Crypto Con has raised an intriguing question about whether BTC is poised for a double top similar to the patterns observed in 2013 and 2021. Analyzing previous market cycles, Crypto Con highlights that more evident double tops, such as those witnessed in the first and third cycles of 2021, triggered significant initial surges on the Fisher Transform indicator. In contrast, the 2017 double-top formation showed a more subtle initial rise in June. Notably, all final cycle tops ended with a regular bearish divergence, where the price reached higher levels while the indicator declined, as seen in the chart below. BTC’s past double top patterns. Source: Crypto Con on X Related Reading: Polygon Observes Buy Signal: Analyst Suggests MATIC Rebound To This Level Currently, Bitcoin is approaching levels similar to those seen in 2017, as seen in the lower part of the chart. Crypto Con suggests that if the Fisher Transform indicator can consolidate around these levels without spiking to the line seen in 2013 and 2021, it could indicate a higher likelihood of a single top formation, which is the analyst’s most likely outcome, for December 2024, marking the top of this cycle.

    "content": "Cardano (ADA) risks a significant price decline as several on-chain metrics paint a bearish sentiment for the crypto token. This coincides with a recent technical analysis by a crypto analyst, who predicted that ADA could drop to as low as $0.4. ADA Sees Decline In Trading Volume Data from the on-chain analytics platform Messari shows a decline in ADA’s trading volume from its recent peak. The crypto token recorded a daily trading volume of $1.53 billion on March 14 but has been on a steady decline since then, recording a daily trading volume of $445.83 million on April 10. Related Reading: Here Are The Drivers Behind The Bitcoin Price Crash To $68,000 Furthermore, data from IntoTheBlock shows three other on-chain metrics signaling a bearish sentiment for the crypto token. The first is the ‘Net Network Growth,’ which has experienced a 0.17% increase in the past week. This metric measures the total number of ADA addresses, meaning more users have left the ecosystem than new ones have come this last week. The second metric is the ‘In the Money,’ which has seen a 0.20% decline in the last seven days. This metric measures the number of ADA holders that are currently in profit at the crypto token’s price level. Meanwhile, large transactions on the Cardano network have also dropped lately, with a 2.60 decline. These large transactions refer to transactions that are over $100,000, suggesting that ADA whales are cooling off on investing in the crypto token. These bearish on-chain metrics further strengthen crypto analyst Alan Santana’s analysis, in which he mentioned that ADA could drop between $0.4444 and $0.3450. Back then, he noted that ADA still had a bearish outlook from a technical analysis perspective, and this outlook would extend until ADA found a strong support level on the charts. ADA’s Derivatives Market Also Shows Bearish Outlook Data from Coinglass shows that the bears are also firmly in control of the ADA ecosystem. In the last 24 hours, $632,720 has been wiped out from ADA’s derivatives market, with long positions ($502,170) accounting for most of these liquidations.

Responding to the user, Cowen stated that he believes the outcome of the next phase will depend on whether or not ALT/BTC pairs have collapsed by then. Furthermore, he affirms there could be a move on the upside if they have not broken down. Meanwhile, in the event that they have broken down, the pattern can transit to something new. It is worth noting that the Bitcoin halving event is forecasted to take place within the next 11 days. Given Bitcoin’s halving previous significant impact on price, BTC could be positioned for a notable price surge in the coming days. However, if Cowen’s recent prediction manifests, it could paint a different picture for the crypto asset during the halving event. The expert’s prediction has sent quite a frenzy in the crypto community, with analysts like Peter Brandt supporting his insights. Peter Brandt acknowledged Cowen’s projections noting that previous Bitcoin bull markets have exhibited a similar fundamental trend. What To Expect During The Halving Event As the halving event approaches, the cryptocurrency data analytics platform Kaiko has laid out a perspective to watch out for.

    "content": "As the Bitcoin (BTC) “Halving” approaches, expectations increase about how the flagship cryptocurrency will perform. Bitcoin (BTC) is recovering momentum after facing a significant correction in the first few days of Q2, and some analysts are forecasting new heights for the number one cryptocurrency soon. Related Reading: Beyond Halving: Expert Predicts Bitcoin To Soar Above $200,000 With Surprising Catalyst Are The Odds In The Bulls Or Bears Favor? Bitcoin had its best quarterly close during Q1, 2024. Despite BTC’s stellar performance, as Q2 started, the market was dragged by the leading cryptocurrency’s price correction. Since then, Bitcoin has been steadily recovering, testing the $70,000 resistance level over the weekend. As the week started, BTC appeared to have regained support above the $70,000 level. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez seems to think that Bitcoin’s performance so far reflects a positive sentiment from investors. In an X post, Martinez shared a chart that paints an optimistic picture, at least for now. When you compare support (1.4 million addresses holding 893,000 $BTC between $68,220 and $70,325) with resistance (474,000 addresses holding 285,000 #BTC between $70,760 and $71,200), the odds appear to favor the #Bitcoin bulls! pic.twitter.com/pceCyGa8mb — Ali (@ali_charts) April 9, 2024 According to Martinez’s post, the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) indicator seems favorable to the bulls. Per the chart, the addresses holding BTC at the support level massively outnumber those holding Bitcoin at the resistance level. The chart suggests that Bitcoin is at “stable support” as 474,000 addresses hold 285,000 BTC between $70,760 and $71,200. Meanwhile, 1.4 million addresses hold the flagship cryptocurrency between $68,220 and $70,325. When compared, the addresses and BTC held at the support level nearly triple those in the resistance zone. To the analyst, bulls are the current victors as “odds appear to favor” them. Analyst Forecast Bitcoin To 90,000 Soon Captain Faibik, another crypto analyst, also seems to perceive more bullish momentum for Bitcoin. In an X post, the analyst suggests that BTC’s “bullish pennant upside break is confirmed on the daily chart.” Per the chart, the flagship cryptocurrency’s price started a consolidation period in early March, forming a pennant pattern. This pattern saw an upside breakout after Monday’s daily candle closed above the $70,000 price range. Due to this breakout, the analyst forecasts a surge to the $88,000-$90,000 price range this month. $BTC Bullish Pennant Upside Breakout is Confirmed on the Daily timeframe Chart.. ? Now, Send Bitcoin to the 88-90k this Month. ??#Crypto #BTC #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/ok2DGPXsAb — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) April 9, 2024 At the time of writing, Bitcoin remains above the $70,000 support level, only 5% below its most recent all-time high (ATH) price of $73,373. Despite the positive resistance, BTC’s price performance shows a slight decrease of 2.3% from yesterday. Similarly, its daily trading volume and market capitalization have mildly dropped. According to CoinMarketCap data, BTC’s daily trading volume is down by 6%, while its market cap of $1.38 trillion represents a 2.1% decrease. Nonetheless, Bitcoin remains 8.4% above its price seven days ago, trading at $70,378. Further bullish sentiment, fueled by the upcoming “Halving” event, could help the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization consolidate its support above the current levels.

    "content": "Renowned crypto analyst Jelle has caught the attention of the Bitcoin (BTC) community with his bold prediction of a target price of $82,000. Notably, despite recent challenges in breaking above the $66,000 mark, Bitcoin currently hovers around $67,780, showing resilience in the face of a short-term pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Insider Tip: Expert Signals Key Catalyst That Could Revive BTC’s Rally BTC To $82,000 Soon? In an X post uploaded earlier today, crypto analyst Jelle shared his latest view on Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the Bitcoin target “remains the same: $82,000”. It is worth noting that Jelle’s forecast is based on his observation of a “bullish pennant” formation, a technical pattern that suggests a potential surge in the price of BTC. According to the analyst, the asset might experience some volatility this month. Jelle emphasized that a bullish pattern is forming, coinciding with the upcoming BTC halving in a few weeks. This adds credibility to the emerged bullish pennant formation and the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $82,000 shortly. #Bitcoin has formed a bullish pennant, right as we head into the halving event. Safe to say we’re in for some volatility this month. My next target remains the same: $82,000. pic.twitter.com/PgBIG1wluX — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) April 4, 2024 Notably, the Halving is a pre-programmed event built into the Bitcoin protocol that occurs approximately every four years or after every 210,000 blocks are mined to reduce the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks, ultimately decreasing the supply of new coins. Historically, the event has triggered bullish price movements, as reduced supply often leads to increased demand and speculative buying. The Bitcoin halving is currently less than 20 days away. Bitcoin Latest Price Action While BTC has faced challenges in its upward trajectory over the past week, recent movements suggest a shift in momentum. Within the last 24 hours alone, the asset has shown a promising 2.7% increase, rising from a low of $65,135 to its current trading price of $67,628. BTC price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com Despite this positive movement, BTC still reflects a decline of approximately 6.4% over the past 7 days. However, amid this fluctuation, analysts such as Captain Faibik foresee the potential for a significant rebound in Bitcoin’s value before April concludes. Captain Faibik’s analysis, mirroring the sentiments of fellow analyst Jelle, focuses on Bitcoin’s bullish pennant formation observed on the 12-hour timeframe chart. This formation suggests an imminent breakout towards the upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Teeters On The Edge Of Glory: Will It Smash The $70,000 Resistance?

    "content": "Crypto gaming, aka GameFi, has been one of the biggest trends in the industry during the past few years. The last market cycle, in particular, was a strong one for the growth of decentralized gaming. As with all trends, the sector plateaued somewhat at the start of 2024 but as of March 2024, it’s quickly picking up steam again. The latest statistics from the industry indicate that cryptocurrency gaming as a whole has increased by as much as 35% since January 2024. Interestingly, its growth spurt actually mirrors that of the universally popular Bitcoin (BTC), albeit at a smaller percentage. Meanwhile, according to CoinGecko, the total value of gaming tokens currently in operation stands at well over $28 billion. Crypto Gaming Explained As its name suggests, the crypto gaming segment is a fusion of digital gaming with decentralized currencies. Also known as GameFi (a portmanteau of gaming and finance), crypto gaming projects offer players new ways to participate in and profit from gaming experiences, while the integration of leading coins like BTC and ETH into existing genres has generated an array of crypto-friendly platforms offering everything from Bitcoin pokies to MOBAs and MMORPGs. At its core, crypto gaming makes use of blockchain tech to provide gamers with radical new in-game economies and governance systems. In contrast to traditional gaming sectors, where in-game assets like character skins and loot boxes are controlled by centralized servers, in crypto gaming economies, players genuinely own their digital assets in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These unique digital assets can then be sold and traded in decentralized marketplaces, providing real-world value and, in some cases, a tangible income. Moreover, the presence of blockchain technology enhances the security of decentralized gaming projects. For instance, games built on the Ethereum chain or any of its level 2 chains will utilize smart contracts to both enforce gameplay rules and automate in-game transactions. Plus, the interoperability aspect of some blockchain ledgers can facilitate the use of digital assets across different games and platforms. The Latest Developments in Crypto Gaming For much of GameFi’s existence, the sector has been dominated by titles like Axie Infinity, the Ethereum chain gaming project from Sky Mavis studios. But there are at least 398 active blockchain games now in the market (based on 2022 statistics from Dapp Radar), suggesting that there’s robust interest in such innovations from both the investor side and the gaming community. So far in 2024, a few emerging projects have broken ahead of the pack. MetaCene, a new Web3 MMORPG, has just finished private round-A funding, pulling in $10 million (including support from Animoca Ventures). MadWorld, a mobile NFT shooter, also picked up $11 million in its seed round, with backing from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz. On March 13th, RON, the native token for the Ethereum scaling network focused on gaming, Ronin, hit a new all-time high of $4.56. Ronin is most known for the 2022 flagship game, Axie Infinity, but here in 2024, a new blockchain game is behind its resurgence. The arrival of Pixels, an NFT and token-driven farming game, onto the chain from Polygon has caused a flurry of interest. Although Pixels is defined by single-token Tokenomics, unlike Axie Infinity’s double-token mechanics, its governing coin PIXEL was nevertheless distributed through airdrop based on the total value of RON staked. Not only that, but a few days later March 13th, Kaidro, another Ronin game, underwent its first minting. As an incentive, new users could mint a free NFT for 24 hours, undoubtedly contributing to yet another surge in interest in both Ronin and its native token. Another coin doing well this spring is GALA, the native cryptocurrency for the Gala Games NFT platform. Now truly in a bull run, the coin underwent a 100% price increase in a span of just two days. Within one week, the increased market capitalization added over $1 billion to its cap, reaching as high as $2.072 billion. As a result, the coin has become a standout performer in the top 100 cryptocurrencies of 2024. The Ethereum-based project has also just achieved a golden cross, with its 30-day moving average crossing above its 200-day stats. This is despite its current value sitting way below its recorded all-time high of $0.8248 (November 2021), indicating the potential for a strong upward trend as crypto gaming continues to pick up traction. New Gaming Projects to Look Out For In addition to the standout GameFi projects discussed above, several other coins on the horizon are showing significant promise for growth and stabilization during 2024: Sponge V2 (SPONGEV2) — this upgraded, tokenized version of the existing Sponge ecosystem is currently generating a lot of interest for its high-yield staking capacity. Last year, the project’s market cap swelled to an impressive $100 million from $1 million, and staking yields for SPONGEV2 are set at 212%. 5th Scape (5SCAPE) — a metaverse project, 5th Scape defines itself as the “world’s first AR and VR crypto gaming ecosystem”. Still in the presale stage, so far, it’s already raised over $1.5 million. Disclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

    "content": "Polygon (MATIC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) both recently experienced bearish price performance on the charts and initially worried investors and traders. Yet, two major crypto analysts took note of their price movements and are now projecting a positive price outlook in their future. Alongside them, Pullix (PLX) has a 100x growth potential, and can push towards new heights in 2024 and beyond due to its innovative exchange. We will go over each one of these cryptos to determine which is one of the best cryptos to buy now. Polygon (MATIC) to Retrace to $1 According to Ali Martinez Polygon (MATIC) has recently undergone a broader period of a downward momentum, and this is evident across all of its on-chart metrics. For example, the year-to-date (YTD) Polygon price movement indicates a 22% decline, while its down 16.4% in the past month. As for the weekly price momentum, the Polygon crypto moved down 10%, as it initially reached $1 before retracing to $0.88. According to major crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the MATIC crypto, as it remained strong above $0.87. According to the analyst ,we could see a rebound to $0.95 or $1. Based on the Polygon price prediction, it can end 2024 at $1.37. Shiba Inu (SHIB) to Climb 2x Based on Captain Faibik Analysis Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also moving downwards in value, despite initially having a year-to-date (YTD) climb of 140%. The Shiba Inu price is down 12.3% on the weekly chart, and 24% on the monthly chart. In addition, during the week, the Shiba Inu crypto climbed from a low point of $0.00002595 to a maximum value of $0.0000309. Crypto analyst Captain Faibik recently went over the on-chart data and noted how the crypto is prepared for another 2x rally. As a result, sentiment is bullish on its future, and according to the Shiba Inu price prediction, it can end 2024 at $0.000060. Pullix (PLX) to 100x Fueled by Massive Ecosystem Growth Pullix (PLX) is a hybrid exchange platform that has begun to get accumulated by traders globally fueled by its vast ecosystem and massive token utility. A key catalyst for this growth is its hybrid approach, as the platform combines elements of CEXs and DEXs to create a unified platform in which anyone can get access to any asset, including cryptocurrencies. From CFDs, to OTC derivatives, and perpetual futures, anyone can begin trading with zero commissions, and tight spreads. The Pullix Beta Trading Platform went live, and real money deposits and trading are now available. In addition, users can stake their PLX to the automated market makers (AMMs) on the Pullix platform, and can get passive income with high APY. The token is now listed on BitMart, XT.com, MEXC, Uniswap, and even on the data aggregators CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. As a result of all of these aspects, analysts are projecting a major 100x price increase by Q4, 2024, making it one of the best cryptos to buy now. Summary While both Polygon and Shiba Inu did see a price decline in the past trading sessions, they have the potential to reach new heights throughout 2024 based on the latest analyst projections. However, Pullix can still be a better buy as analysts are projecting a 100x price increase, which can provide the most significant ROI, positioning PLX as the best new crypto to invest in.

    "summary": "There has been uncertainty in the crypto market, but that has not stopped the likes of Dogecoin and XRP from making moves.\n",
    "content": "In the last few weeks, there has been uncertainty in the crypto market, but that has not stopped the likes of Dogecoin and XRP from making moves. One of the most notable developments, however, was the entry of Toncoin (TON) into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, and then dethroning Cardano (ADA). Following this, Dogecoin looks ready to carry out a flippening of its own, eyeing XRP’s spot on the list. Dogecoin Gearing Up To Take Over XRP Dogecoin has performed rather well at a time when the crypto market has remained indecisive. Even though there has been times when the price has dipped, it has managed to reclaim $0.2, although the majority of bearish resistance is being mounted at this junction. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Drops Trading Strategy To Profit Off Shiba Inu’s Next Leg Up Above $0.00003 Nevertheless, Dogecoin’s ability to hold most of its gains from March has seen its market cap increase rapidly. From less than $15 billion at the start of the year 2024, the meme coin’s market cap has now climbed above $28.6 billion, putting it dangerously close to the market cap of XRP. At the time of writing, XRP’s market cap is sitting at $33.9 billion, spurred by the decline in its price over the last week. This means that the market cap of XRP is now only 15.6% higher than that of Dogecoin, a perilously small gap given how quickly prices of cryptocurrencies can rise. In this case, if Dogecoin continues to perform well and XRP fails to keep up, it could easily lose the sixth spot on the list to DOGE. A 20% rise in the DOGE price to $0.24 would put its market cap above $34 billion, putting it ahead of XRP. And if XRP’s continues to fall, then the gap could tighten over the next week. DOGE Price Projected To Explode Dogecoin currently boasts one of the strongest crypto communities, and some would argue even stronger than the XRP army, as DOGE’s support base has strengthened due to its outperformance in the past. This support base and rapid adoption are two of the foremost factors that promise an interesting future for the meme coin. Related Reading: Here Are The Drivers Behind The Bitcoin Price Crash To $68,000 There have been many predictions for where the future price of DOGE might be, with some going as high as $100. However, according to crypto Analyst Ali Martinez, Dogecoin could do quite well in this bull market. The analysis posted by Martinez reveals multiple price targets, with $12 at the top. These targets, if they play out correctly, will see the DOGE market cap rise rapidly, and unless XRP pulls some equally bullish moves, it will soon be behind DOGE on the list of largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. But for now, both cryptocurrencies at maintaining their places with XRP in 6th position and Dogecoin in 8th position behind stablecoin USDC.

Bitcoin At $82,000 Remains The Target Following the recent recovery observed today, Crypto Jelle, a popular cryptocurrency expert and Bitcoin enthusiast, has made a bullish forecast for the crypto asset, citing the $82,000 level in the short term. Crypto Jelle highlighted that after a fakeout, Bitcoin retested the cycle highs of 2021, bounced, and then broke out once more. According to the analyst, BTC now has just one more obstacle to surpass as a result of the retest. Related Reading: Are The Odds In Bitcoin Bulls Favor? These Analysts Forecast BTC’s Future Furthermore, he affirms that the race toward new highs will begin when the largest cryptocurrency asset manages to break and hold over $71,500. As a result, the crypto analyst anticipates a rally soon, placing the coin’s next target at around $82,000. BTC retested 2021 cycle high | Source: Crypto Jelle on X Jelle has addressed a pressing issue in the crypto community. He mentioned some are still concerned about the next 3% move, whereas the higher timeframe chart seems more optimistic. Thus, he has urged investors to be patient and hold onto their bags to enjoy the positive move, as the crypto asset appears to be poised for significant growth in the upcoming months. With the impending halving event anticipated to occur this month, Jelle’s prediction could develop in a short period. Halvings have historically been seen to have a significant effect on the coin. If this year’s halving mirrors past trends, BTC could surge to $82,000 in weeks and even further upward. Several analysts believe that the event could propel the price of BTC to $150,000 before the end of the year. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $70,344, indicating a 1.84% increase in the past 24 hours. Both its overall market cap and trading volume have also risen by 1.87% and 13% respectively in the past day. Speculated Price Target For BTC This Month Ever since BTC witnessed a price recovery, many bullish predictions have surfaced concerning its next trajectory. Another analyst who has predicted BTC to reach above the $80,000 range is Adrian Zidanic. Related Reading: 12 Days Until Bitcoin Halving: Why $100,000 Isn’t Much Further Away During an episode on Thinking Crypto, Tony Edward the show’s host, drew attention to Zidanic’s prediction, in which the expert pointed out a bullish ascending triangle that is emerging in the Bitcoin chart within this consolidation phase. Zidanic foresees a breakout occurring shortly, with $86,500 as his target price. Although his projections acknowledge a greater likelihood of a positive scenario unfolding within the month. Examining the chart, Edward expressed his optimism that the aforementioned price could manifest post-halving. Edward believes it could move further to $90,000, underscoring his price range between $85,000 and $90,000 and urging the community to be patient.

    "content": "The emergence of Meme Coins in the constantly changing cryptocurrency market has drawn interest from traders across the globe. With recent success stories like Dogwifhat, Book of Meme, and SLERF making headlines, traders hoping to profit from this growing industry must now comprehend the intricacies of Meme Coins. Meme Coins mostly depend on community mood, viral trends, and speculative trading, whereas cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum get their value from technological infrastructure and practical applications. The Importance of Research and Analysis Before diving into Meme Coin investments, thorough research is paramount. Examining a project’s website and social media presence provides valuable insights into its purpose, goals, and development roadmap. Furthermore, evaluating the project’s team, community engagement, and development progress helps gauge its long-term viability and growth potential. Key Factors in Meme Coin Analysis Market Capitalization: Assessing a Meme Coin’s market capitalization provides context for its position within the broader cryptocurrency landscape. While higher market capitalization implies stability and liquidity, lower market cap coins may offer greater growth potential albeit with increased risk. Community Support: Vibrant communities play a crucial role in a Meme Coin’s success. Active engagement, positive sentiment, and widespread adoption contribute to increased demand and price appreciation. Development and Roadmap: A transparent and committed development team instills confidence in a project’s prospects. Monitoring progress against the project’s roadmap and milestones offers insights into its growth trajectory.

    "content": "In a dramatic turn of events, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding users. The judgment was handed down by US District Judge Lewis Kaplan during a hearing in a Lower Manhattan federal courtroom on March 28. Bankman-Fried, who had publicly announced plans to appeal the conviction, has now officially filed an objection to the decision. ‘Remorse And Empathy’ For FTX Customers During the sentencing hearing, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan leveled serious accusations against Bankman-Fried, including perjury and evasiveness during his testimony. The judge expressed disappointment in Bankman-Fried’s lack of regret for the crimes committed. Related Reading: XRP Sees An Alarming 1,800% Surge In Liquidations, Whats Going On? In response, Bankman-Fried expressed remorse and empathy for the “thousands of customers” who suffered financial losses. He acknowledged his responsibility as CEO of FTX and expressed desire to repair the damage caused. Bankman-Fried expressed frustration at the loss of what he had achieved and his limited ability to improve the situation from prison. Despite his efforts, he acknowledged the constraints that limited his ability to do more. Sam Bankman-Fried Alleges Trial Unfairness In a post-conviction interview, Bankman-Fried expressed concerns about the fairness of his trial, specifically targeting Sullivan \u0026 Cromwell, the law firm representing FTX’s new owners. The disgraced FTX co-founder accused the law firm of colluding with the prosecution and obstructing his access to key FTX documents shared with the prosecution. Bankman-Fried claimed that this had a detrimental effect on the entire trial, including media coverage and the defense’s ability to present evidence in his favor. With the official appeal now filed, Bankman-Fried is seeking a different outcome, hoping for a reduced sentence. He emphasized the importance of introducing crucial evidence and presenting key witnesses, which he claims his defense was denied the opportunity to do during the trial. Currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, Bankman-Fried has been particularly vocal about his desire to remain in the MDC-Brooklyn jail pending the outcome of his appeal.

Riding the Ripple: Unveiling XRP’s Potential and Price Projections in 2024 XRP offers several compelling features, including its speed and efficiency in cross-border payments, low transaction fees, and scalability. These attributes make XRP attractive for financial institutions and remittance companies. Price predictions for XRP vary widely among analysts. Some foresee a potential surge to $1 or higher in 2024, considering the release of a Ripple stablecoin. Others are more conservative, anticipating further declines.

Its commitment to research-driven development and community governance further solidifies its position as a leading blockchain platform in the cryptocurrency space.

    "content": "Ethereum Layer-2 solutions to hit $1 trillion in market cap by 2023 based on data from investment manager VanEck. According to the report, they can capitalize on Ethereum’s primary challenge, its limited capacity to process, store and compute data. Two of the largest scaling solutions include Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP), which have seen solid price performance as-well. However, another project built on Ethereum is also rising, and that’s KangaMoon (KANG) which spiked 290%. Today, we will go over their price performance to see how far they can rise, and to see which will be one of the top DeFi projects. KangaMoon (KANG) Up 290% KangaMoon (KANG) can experience a remarkable level of growth as it has already begun to dominate the charts following its monumental rise in value from $0.005 to $0.0196 marking a 290% increase. It’s also raised over $4.3 million and can raise $4.7 million during the week. The key reason for this massive momentum is because the crypto goes beyond the classic trope of meme coins and introduces a vast ecosystem that rewards players with massive token utility. On top of the platform, there is a Play-to-Earn (P2E) element, coupled with Social-Fi features and a community-driven approach. Players can create their own KangaMoon character and through it, can enter tournaments, fights, or even place bets on battles in order to get rewards in the form of KANG tokens or NFTs. In fact, there are now over 5,800 KANG holders, and the community has over 20,000 registered users. Based on the latest analyst projections, the crypto can spike 100x following its launch, making it one of the top DeFi projects. Arbitrum (ARB) to Spike to $2.32 by the End of Q4, 2024 Arbitrum (ARB) has displayed a price correction phase in the short-term, where it dipped 30.3% in the past 30 days. However, the year-to-date (YTD) climb for the Arbitrum price was by 24%, and during the past week, it moved up from $1.44 to $1.69. If the Layer-2 solutions for Ethereum do hit $1 trillion in market cap, the Arbitrum crypto has massive growth potential, and could soon regain significant bullish attention. According to the Arbitrum price prediction, it can end 2024 at $2.32. Optimism (OP) to Reach $5.50 by the End of the Year Optimism (OP) is another Layer-2 scaling solution which showcased a year-to-date (YTD) growth of 43%. Moreover, during the previous week, the Optimism price spiked from a low point of $3.02 to $3.79, and at this rate, it is closer towards breaking the $4 price barrier. Moreover, according to the on-chart metrics, the Optimism crypto’s RSI and MACD data are optimistic, and signal a potential price uptrend. According to the Optimism price prediction, by Q4, 2024, it can reach $5.50. Summary It’s clear that Layer-2 solutions are the future, and with that in mind Arbitrum and Optimism have major growth potential. For the time being, the most bullish performance was however experienced by KangaMoon which has surged 290% and can reach a growth of 100x following its launch. These aspects position it as the best DeFi crypto to jump into in 2024 and beyond. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) Presale Today!

    "content": "Cryptocurrencies are a recent addition to the trade scene, but they’ve already found a place alongside metals, forex and indices. Now, thanks to the Pullix (PLX) trading platform, traders can access all these different markets in one place. Certain analysts hint that this DeFi coin may rise by 100x in 2024. Let’s see why. Combining the Best Features of CEX and DEX Pullix (PLX) is the world’s first hybrid trading platform. In other words, Pullix combines the best of DEX and CEX into one platform. Therefore, traders can access all asset classes on Pullix, including cryptocurrencies, Forex, gold, OTC derivatives and more. You can trade all these through just one platform, which is more convenient than most trading platforms. With this many options to choose from, your portfolio will automatically be diversified and your chances of making profits multiply. This DeFi project also boasts complete privacy, as it requires no sign-up KYC checks. As the demand for privacy continues growing, this feature could make Pullix a fan-favorite for countless individuals. Recently, Pullix released the beta version of this platform and countless individuals are rushing to take part in it. The Role of the PLX Token The PLX token lies at the center of the Pullix ecosystem. This DeFi coin is full of utility. For example, traders who possess PLX tokens enjoy reduced trading fees, access premium features and more. To stand out from most DeFi coins, PLX is also the very first “Trade-to-Earn” crypto. In other words, Pullix will reward PLX stakers with a portion of their daily earnings. This will improve liquidity and engagement since the more trades are made, the more rewards there will be for stakers. Another exciting aspect of PLX is its token burn mechanism. To clarify, Pullix implements a burn event, which will reduce this DeFi coin’s supply over time. Therefore, scarcity will set in and increase PLX’s value in the future. With this development, long-term PLX token holders stand to benefit. A Potential 100x Jump for this DeFi Crypto Currently, PLX is worth just $0.094. However, demand for it is skyrocketing. Major crypto exchanges and data aggregators such as MEXC, CoinMarketCap, BitMart, CoinGecko and Uniswap have already listed this DeFi token. As more Tier-1 exchanges opt to list PLX, more eyes will be drawn to it. Pullix will also enter flourishing markets like the OTC derivatives one. According to BIS, this market grew by 13% in the second half of 2022 to reach $20.7T before the year ended. This DeFi project strategically positions itself to dominate this market and capitalize on its growth. Therefore, market analysts forecast a 100x surge for PLX within Q3 of 2024. Pullix (PLX): One of the Best DeFi Projects Right Now In conclusion, Pullix is a game changer in the trading space. With its innovative features, traditional trading might be disrupted. As Pullix keeps gaining traction and popularity, the PLX DeFi coin also experiences growth each day. Thanks to its low market cap, it will need a small amount of new funds for its price to 100x – making PLX the best DeFi crypto to buy.

    "content": "Franklin Templeton’s digital assets division has released a note to its investors introducing Bitcoin-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs), highlighting a surge in activity within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The asset manager attributes this increased momentum to various factors, including the emergence of Bitcoin (BTC) NFTs called Ordinals, the development of new fungible standards like BRC-20 and Runes, the growth of Bitcoin Layer 2 (L2s) solutions, and the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Ordinals Shine According to the Bitcoin ETF issuer’s report, activity in the Bitcoin NFT space is gaining momentum. In particular, Ordinals have seen a significant increase in trading volume over the past few months. This growth is evident in Bitcoin’s dominance in terms of trading volume, which surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in December 2023, as shown in the accompanying chart. BTC Ordinals growth since late 2023. Source: Franklin Templeton Related Reading: Trouble Ahead? Binance Coin Futures Market Under Pressure With Negative Funding Rates In addition, several collections of Bitcoin Ordinals are emerging as dominant players in the NFT market, both in terms of trading volume and market capitalization. These collections include NodeMonkes, Runestone, and Bitcoin Puppets, which have an aggregate market cap of $353 million, $339 million, and $168 million, respectively. They are the most notable collections. In terms of trading volume over the past 30 days, the report shows that these three collections recorded trading volumes of $81 million, $85 million, and $38 million, respectively, over the past month. The asset manager further claimed that what distinguishes BTC Ordinals from NFTs on other blockchains, such as Ethereum or Solana, is that they contain raw data recorded directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This feature contributes to the attractiveness and growing popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals, as evidenced by market cap and trading volume figures. Franklin Templeton, known for its involvement in the ETF market, was one of the issuers that launched a spot BTC ETF in the United States earlier this year. Its ETF, which trades under the ticker name “EZBC,” has seen total inflows of 281.8 million since its January 11 launch, according to BitMEX research data as of April 3. Despite its zero-fee structure, Franklin Templeton’s ETF has seen a significant difference in flows compared to the leading players in the newly approved ETF market, such as Blackrock (IBIT) and Fidelity (FBTC), which have seen flows of over 14 billion and 7.7 billion, respectively. Binance To Discontinue Support For BTC NFTs In a recent blog post, crypto exchange Binance announced it would discontinue support for Bitcoin-based NFTs on its marketplace. Less than a year after their introduction, Binance will no longer facilitate airdrops, benefits, or utilities associated with BTC NFTs, citing a need to streamline its product offerings in the NFT space. Related Reading: Injective Whales Go On $24.8 Million Buying Spree, Is This The Next Solana? Binance states that users who own Bitcoin NFTs are advised to withdraw them from the Binance NFT marketplace via the Bitcoin network before May 18, 2024. Effective April 18, 2024, users can no longer purchase, deposit, bid, or list NFTs via the BTC network on the Binance NFT Marketplace. Any existing listing orders affected by this change will be automatically canceled simultaneously. The 1-D chart shows that BTC’s price is trending upward.

    "content": "Bitcoin, one analyst notes on X, is looking healthy for the first time since the coin soared to over $70,000, printing all-time highs back in March 2024. The assessment is due to funding rates dropping to within ordinary levels, an indicator that volatility is also falling and moments of fear of missing out (FOMO) are fading. BTC funding rate is dropping | Analyst on X Funding Rates At “Normal Levels” As FOMO Dissipates In crypto perpetual trading, the funding rate is the fee exchanged between market participants. These fees are market-determined and are adjusted every eight hours or so. Depending on market conditions, they can be positive or negative. However, they play a critical role in determining momentum. Of note, bulls pay a fee to bears When perpetual prices are higher than the spot price. This, in turn, discourages buying in the perpetual market and incentivizes buying into the spot, bringing prices closer. Related Reading: CEO Throws Cold Water On May Ethereum ETF Approval – Impact On Price Whenever prices rally, as has been the case since the start of the year when Bitcoin has generally been in the green, those who enter long have to pay sellers to keep prices from deviating, as mentioned above. However, at spot rates, the rate leveraged buyers are paying is slightly lower as FOMO drops. Once prices rapidly expand, ideally above March 2024 highs, this funding rate will likely increase to February and March 2024 levels. Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView So far, Bitcoin is changing hands above $70,800 at spot rates and within a bullish formation. Of note is that buyers are in charge of reversing losses posted on April 8. Even so, for the uptrend to remain, prices must break out above $72,500 and the April 8 high on rising volume. BTC will likely float to over $73,800 and enter price discovery in that case. Bitcoin Rises After CPI Data In The United States, Institutions Pouring In? With FOMO dissipating and “normalcy resuming,” the analyst said the coin is now better positioned to soar higher, backed by organic momentum generated from market participants. After dipping slightly on April 9, the coin rose following positive news about the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States. While the “hot” CPI pushed other assets lower, Bitcoin prices bounced to spot levels. Experts say the coin might benefit as risk-averse traders shift to safe-haven coins to shield their value from raging inflation.

As institutions pour in, buying shares of spot BTC ETFs issued by players like Fidelity, the demand for the underlying coin might soar to fresh levels, lifting prices. Moreover, some analysts are bullish, saying prices will benefit once GBTC stops offloading coins.

    "content": "The cryptocurrency bull market has mostly sustained its impressive momentum, and despite some blips in price growth, investors are getting more optimistic. While this is noteworthy, the true opportunities lie within the smaller altcoin markets, where a handful of tokens have recently stood out prominently. Specifically, 5th Scape (5SCAPE), Smog (SMOG), and eTukTuk (TUK) are capturing significant investor interest. We provide comprehensive insights into these projects here, covering all the essential details you need to know. 5th Scape Takes On The VR World 5th Scape (5SCAPE) is dedicated to pioneering the world’s inaugural Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) ecosystem, aimed at connecting the brightest minds. Their ambitious vision encompasses developing VR games, hardware, and animations, supported by a meticulous strategy. The key to 5th Scape’s success lies in ensuring broad accessibility and compatibility with existing headsets and hardware. To achieve this, the team is focused on creating VR games that seamlessly integrate with popular headsets like Oculus Rift and Meta Quest 3. Additionally, they plan to develop a proprietary VR headset and AR gaming chair once firmly established in the industry. Regarding specific VR game development, the team has unveiled several titles in progress, including Cage Conquest, Epic Cricket Arena, Immersive Kickoff, Archery Master, and Thrust Hunter. Cage Conquest holds particular significance as a combat sports-based game set for initial release, tentatively scheduled for the second quarter of 2024. The project’s native token, 5SCAPE, serves as the foundation of the ecosystem, acting as essential fuel for various interactions. It functions as the universal currency across all 5th Scape games, hardware products, and the developer marketplace. Token holders enjoy exclusive discounts compared to other payment methods, making it the preferred mode of payment for game access and in-game transactions. 5SCAPE token holders also have the opportunity to stake their tokens, earning rewards through active project engagement. Additionally, the 5th Scape team aims to empower token holders by enabling them to vote on fund distribution for marketplace projects, encouraging community involvement in significant project development decisions. In terms of tokenomics, 5SCAPE has a total token supply of 5.21 billion. The 5th Scape presale aims to distribute 80% of the total supply, with a fundraising target of up to $15 million. The presale is conducted in 12 stages, with the current price set at $0.00285 and the listing price at $0.01. To date, it has raised over $3.8 million. Smog Dominates Meme Coin Conversations Meme coins consistently dominate the landscape of rapidly expanding cryptocurrency tokens, competing fiercely for top positions. This trend has been unmistakably apparent over the past year, with numerous meme coins consistently outpacing the broader market. It is expected that this trend will continue into the future, with the meme coin sector remaining one of the most dynamic and effective avenues for generating returns. Among the contenders in the meme coin category, Smog (SMOG) emerges as a significant player. This Solana-based meme coin has rapidly gained traction on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), achieving a $2 million market capitalization on Jupiter. The forthcoming airdrop, alongside an ongoing 10% discount offer, suggests the potential for substantial growth. SMOG follows the footsteps of successful predecessors like Bonk and Myro, both of which experienced remarkable growth trajectories. Notably, SMOG’s DEX trading volumes have even surpassed those of Uniswap in recent times. With its impressive momentum, SMOG stands poised to surpass the achievements of SPONGE, which surged 50x from $2 million to $100 million. Consequently, SMOG emerges as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies for investment at present, with the imminent airdrop potentially propelling it to the forefront as the leading meme coin of 2024. eTukTuk Puts The Environment First eTukTuk (TUK) embodies this principle while setting itself apart with a unique framework and specific application, capitalizing on industry advancements and innovations made over the past decade. By integrating blockchain technology and AI advancements, eTukTuk addresses carbon emissions by advocating for environmentally friendly transportation alternatives. The initiative aims to drive the global shift toward electric vehicles, with the eTukTuk EV as its flagship product, offering an affordable and reliable alternative to traditional TukTuks. Supported by an ecosystem of efficient charging stations, it assists drivers in maximizing earnings while providing various benefits to all involved parties. Your engagement as a user not only contributes to the solution but also allows you to enjoy the benefits of reduced carbon emissions. The significance of the TUK token becomes evident as it provides users with advantages through the expansion of the network’s efficient charging stations. In addition to environmental benefits, the team emphasizes the positive impact on underserved communities facing financial disparities and higher living expenses. Despite the ambitious goal of “permanently eradicating carbon emissions from our planet,” the project underscores its commitment to environmental improvement. eTukTuk seamlessly integrated the Layer 2 opBNB from the BNB Chain, demonstrating its dedication to efficiency and innovation, and presenting attractive opportunities for early adopters in the cryptocurrency sphere. This transition was driven by the adoption of the Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism on the BNB Chain, a methodology that experienced significant growth last year. Currently, the TUK token is available at a presale price of $0.0295, having garnered over $2.7 million in funding. Staking opportunities are also accessible, with immediate staking of the token post-purchase offering an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 143%, further enhancing its appeal. Conclusion The ongoing crypto bull market is set to be remembered in the annals of cryptocurrency history for the emergence of numerous prominent altcoins. Among them, 5th Scape (5SCAPE), Smog (SMOG), and eTukTuk (TUK) stand out as notable examples, highlighting the extensive roster of rapidly ascending altcoins. We recommend promptly exploring their presale opportunities and following their social media channels for updates. Check Out Smog Disclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

    "content": "UNI price turned red and declined below the $10.00 support. Uniswap is showing many bearish signs and recoveries could face hurdles near $10.00. UNI started a fresh decline below the $10.00 support zone. The price is trading below $9.50 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $10.25 on the 4-hour chart of the UNI/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might recover but the upsides might be limited above $10.00. UNI Price Takes Hit After the SEC news, UNI started a major decline. There was an increase in selling pressure on Uniswap below the $12.00 pivot level. The price declined over 15% and traded below the $10.00 support. It also increased some pressure on Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was also a drop below the $9.20 level. The price traded as low as $8.72 and it is still showing many bearish signs. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $10.25 on the 4-hour chart of the UNI/USD pair. UNI price is now trading well below $10.00 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $9.45 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $11.79 swing high to the $8.72 low. The next key resistance is near the $10.25 level or the trend line. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $11.79 swing high to the $8.72 low. Source: UNIUSD on TradingView.com A close above the $10.25 level could open the doors for more gains in the near term. The next key resistance could be near $11.80, above which the bulls are likely to aim a test of the $12.00 level. Any more gains might send UNI toward $13.50. More Losses In Uniswap? If UNI price fails to climb above $9.45 or $9.50, it could continue to move down. The first major support is near the $8.70 level. The next major support is near the $8.50 level. A downside break below the $8.50 support might open the doors for a push toward $7.65. Technical Indicators 4-Hours MACD – The MACD for UNI/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. 4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for UNI/USD is below the 25 level. Major Support Levels – $8.70, $8.50, and $7.65. Major Resistance Levels – $9.45, $10.00, and $10.25. Disclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

    "content": "Bitcoin has surged back above the $70,000 level during the past day despite the negative Net Taker Volume for the asset. Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Has Seen Some Large Negative Spikes Recently As explained by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a post on X, selling spikes of a significantly heavier scale than before have recently appeared in the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin 2 Months Through “Euphoria Wave,” How Long Was The Last One? The “Net Taker Volume” is an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin taker buy and taker sell volumes in perpetual swaps. How can the sell and buy volumes be different? As CryptoQuant explains in its data guide: This concept is often confusing because every trade requires both a buyer and a seller of the given underlying asset. However, depending on whether the order taker is a buyer or seller (whether a transaction occurs at the ask price or the bid price), you can distinguish between long volume from taker seller volume. When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the taker buy volume is overwhelming the taker sell volume right now. Such a trend implies a bullish sentiment is shared by the majority. On the other hand, the negative indicator suggests that more sellers are willing to sell the coin at a lower price, a sign that a bearish mentality is the dominant one. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have been quite red in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume has recently registered a sharp negative spike, implying that the taker sell volume has been higher than the taker buy volume. The Net Taker Volume has been seeing some large red spikes for a while, as the analyst highlighted in the chart. “Bitcoin is being hammered down massively, with selling spikes on the Net Taker Volume significantly heavier than before,” says Maartunn. Interestingly, despite this bearish sentiment in the market, the Bitcoin price has managed to hold up relatively well. Obviously, the coin’s bullish momentum has gone while these negative Net Taker Volume spikes have taken hold, but the fact that BTC has shown strength against any sustained drawdowns is still impressive. Related Reading: Dogecoin Slows Down: What Needs To Happen For New DOGE Highs? A pattern that’s perhaps visible in the chart is that although the Net Taker Volume has continued to see red spikes recently, their scale has gradually decreased. Thus, if this trend continues, it’s possible that the bearish mentality will eventually run out, and buying pressure will take over Bitcoin. It now remains to be seen how the indicator develops shortly. BTC Price Bitcoin declined below $68,000 just yesterday, but today, the asset has already bounced back and is now trading around $70,800.

Algorand stands as a prime example of innovative and sustainable blockchain technology, offering a glimpse into the future of decentralized finance and digital governance. AVAX (Avalanche): The interoperability pioneer Avalanche (AVAX) has emerged as a significant player in the blockchain space, with rapid developments and a strong market performance that underscores its potential. Launched in September 2020, Avalanche has become known for its fast smart contracts platform. It addresses some critical limitations of older blockchain platforms, like centralization, slow transaction speeds, and scalability issues. Its mainnet anniversary was marked by a $230 million private sale of AVAX tokens to bolster its public ecosystem, showcasing robust investor confidence and its status as one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies. Avalanche’s strategic focus has been enhancing its ecosystem through key partnerships and initiatives. Its strategic emphasis on real-world assets (RWAs) and GameFi, ahead of 2024, has positioned Avalanche at the forefront of these burgeoning blockchain narratives. Strategic partnerships with banking giants like JPMorgan Chase and CitiBank to leverage Avalanche for RWA projects, alongside the launch of Avalanche Vista, a $50 million fund dedicated to RWA research and development, have been pivotal. These moves align with predictions that $3 trillion worth of assets will be tokenized within the next five years, positioning AVAX for significant growth. Avalanche’s on-chain transactions have seen a considerable uptick, driven by GameFi activity and an increase in the monthly subnet transaction count. Over 300% growth in GameFi activity since October and a 36% surge in subnet transactions underscore Avalanche’s growing appeal. The network’s processing capacity of more than 19 million transactions in January, along with its comprehensive ecosystem hosting over 270 projects, including Tether, SushiSwap, Chainlink, Circle, and The Graph, speaks to its scalability and the robustness of its infrastructure. The community around Avalanche is notably bullish about its future, reflecting a strong belief in the project’s roadmap and its ability to revolutionize the DeFi sector. The successful AP4 activation on the Fuji Testnet, which brought cheaper fees, increased processing speed, and full support from Moralis for easier dApp development, has further fueled community enthusiasm. Avalanche’s market performance, strategic initiatives, and strong community support paint a promising picture for its future in the blockchain industry.

The platform and its token, ECLD, are accessible on several exchanges, offering plenty of investment opportunities. Additionally, joining the Ethernity Cloud community through forums, social media, and participating in governance allows investors to directly contribute to and benefit from the platform’s growth. Risk vs. reward While undervalued tokens present promising opportunities, navigating the landscape of cryptocurrency investment comes with its inherent risks and potential rewards. Market volatility remains a significant concern, with prices subject to dramatic fluctuations that can affect investment value quickly. Regulatory changes also pose a risk, as the evolving legal framework around cryptocurrencies can impact market stability and investment security. Technological risks, including security vulnerabilities, add another layer of complexity, necessitating vigilant security practices to protect investments from theft and fraud. To manage these risks effectively, diversification across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes is key, helping to mitigate the impact of any single investment’s poor performance. Thorough research and due diligence are crucial, enabling investors to make informed decisions and understand the intricacies of their investment choices. With a balanced approach, incorporating careful planning and risk management strategies, investors can potentially realize significant gains, capitalizing on the long-term growth prospects of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion The tokens spotlighted in this list, BLD, ECLD, AVAX, and ALGO, represent significant yet undervalued, opportunities in the dynamic crypto market. Each brings unique advantages and innovative solutions to the table—BLD with its focus on secure, JavaScript-based smart contracts for the Agoric ecosystem, ECLD in revolutionizing cloud computing through decentralized and secure data processing, AVAX in spearheading DeFi and asset tokenization to bridge traditional and blockchain finance, and ALGO by addressing the blockchain trilemma to offer a balanced mix of speed, security, and decentralization.

They’re at the forefront of promoting cross-chain interoperability, boosting transactional efficiency, and contributing to a safer, more inclusive digital financial environment, marking them as prime candidates for investment consideration. Investors should conduct detailed analyses and consider diversifying their portfolios to include these promising tokens. Such a calculated approach is vital for navigating the forthcoming wave of crypto advancements. With the scene set for a significant market evolution, the critical question for investors shifts from readiness to engage with these opportunities to contemplation of their future growth: Will these undervalued tokens reach their full investment potential as the cryptocurrency era progresses? Time will tell. Disclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Bitcoin Halving Effects On Prices Is Fading CryptoQuant wrote in a recent research report that the upcoming Bitcoin halving event scheduled this April may not deliver the desired price shock expected by most crypto analysts and investors in the space. According to the analytics firm, the influence of the Bitcoin halving event has been dwindling over time, with the price of the cryptocurrency and a potential bullish rally being driven by a new change in market dynamics. Related Reading: VeChain On The Edge: Insider Says VET Will Reach The Finish Line Notably, CryptoQuant disclosed that the demand from long-term and large-scale investors, whales, has become one of the primary factors pushing the price of BTC upward. The Head of Research at CryptoQuant, Julio Monero disclosed on Tuesday, April 9, that the demand for Bitcoin from permanent holders has recently outpaced issuance for the first time in history. In its report, CryptoQuant also highlighted an 11% month-on-month increase in large-scale Bitcoin investors holding between 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, reaching unprecedented levels. This elevated demand is in sharp contrast with BTC’s supply dynamics and is poised to increase further after the halving event concludes. Currently, long-term Bitcoin holders are accumulating more tokens than the new investors entering the market. CryptoQuant revealed that permanent holders have also been adding as much as 200,000 BTC to their portfolio every month while long-term holders are amassing seven times more BTC per month. “We argue that the effect of the halving has been diminishing, as the new issuance of Bitcoin gets smaller relative to the amount of Bitcoin selling from long-term holders,” the analytics firm wrote. Analysts Remain Optimistic About Halving Influence Despite CryptoQuant’s report on Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamics, numerous analysts still expect a significant uptick in Bitcoin’s price following the halving event. Analysts like Joe Consorti have predicted BTC’s price to rise to $100,000 following the Bitcoin halving. Additionally, he has expressed optimism about a potential bullish rally for the cryptocurrency during this period.

Moreover, due to historical trends revealing a correlation between the Bitcoin halving event and a price surge for the cryptocurrency, various crypto investors have predicted a similar bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency this year. Recently, open interest in Bitcoin surged to new all-time highs above $18 billion. This increase suggests that traders and investors are still bullish on Bitcoin’s future value, seeing any price dips as buying opportunities before a potential rally.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Distributing Recently In a new post on X, Glassnode lead analyst Checkmate discussed the recent behavior of the long-term Bitcoin holders. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) here refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins for over six months. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. Since the LTHs hold for significant periods, they are considered quite resolute. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whale Takes $52.3 Million In DOGE Off Binance, Sign Of Buying? And indeed, they display this resilience in their behavior, rarely selling despite whatever is happening in the broader market. As such, the times they sell are all the more noteworthy. Historically, the LTHs have taken to distribution during bull runs when the asset has broken its previous all-time high (ATH) price. Due to their long holding times, these investors amass large profits, which they start to spend when a high amount of demand comes in during bull rallies that happily take coins off their hands at high prices. Checkmate explained that the recent ATH break of the cryptocurrency has looked similar to any other past one, with the LTHs already having started spending for this round. The chart below shows the trend in the supply of Bitcoin LTHs over the past few years. The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent weeks | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin LTHs have recently observed their supply heading down. Remember that when it comes to increases in this metric, there is a delay associated with when buying is happening and when this supply is going up. This is natural because the newly bought coins must age for six months before they can be considered a part of the cohort’s holdings. When it comes to drawdowns, though, the same delay doesn’t emerge, as the age of the coins instantly resets back to zero, and they exit the group. Thus, the latest distribution from the LTHs is indeed happening. “In the prior two cycles, new demand for Bitcoin was able to absorb this LTH sell-side for around 6-8 months while pushing prices multiples higher,” explains the Glassnode lead.

    "content": "On-chain data shows the recent Bitcoin drawdown has shaken up the short-term holders, leading them to make large exchange deposits at a loss. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Have Transferred Huge Volume In Loss To Exchanges As analyst James Van Straten pointed out in a post on X, the BTC short-term holders have recently participated in a large amount of loss-taking. The “short-term holders” (STHs) are the Bitcoin investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. The STHs make up one of the two main divisions of the BTC market, which is done on the basis of holding time, with the other cohort being known as the long-term holders (LTHs). Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders No Longer Extremely Greedy: Rebound Signal? Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the STHs would reflect the weak-minded side of the market, while the LTHs would be the persistent diamond hands. Given their fickle nature, the STHs usually easily react whenever a notable sector change occurs, like a price rally or crash. Recently, BTC has registered a significant drawdown, so these investors would likely have made some moves. Indeed, on-chain data would confirm this. Below is a Glassnode chart shared by Straten, which reveals the trend in the transfer volume in loss (in USD) going from the wallets of the STHs to centralized exchanges. The value of the metric appears to have been quite high in recent days | Source: @jvs_btc on X As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin short-term holders have recently deposited a large number of tokens holding a loss into exchange-affiliated wallets. Exchange inflows usually suggest demand for using the services these platforms provide, which can include selling. As these latest deposits from the STHs have come following a sharp drop in the price, it would appear possible that the panic-sellers indeed made these inflows. As the Bitcoin price is currently near the all-time high (ATH), most of the STH group would be holding a profit. So, all this loss volume can only come from those who bought at the recent highs. This isn’t the first time the market has observed such quick capitulation from FOMO buyers this year. The chart shows that the exchange transfer volume in loss from the STHs also spiked very high during the plunge that followed the latest price ATH. The spike back then was even greater in scale than the one witnessed recently and suggested the shakeout of the holders who the news of the ATH had driven in.

    "content": "The Bitcoin price has somewhat slowed down since reaching the unprecedented high of $73,000, moving mostly sideways since mid-March. However, with the halving event less than a fortnight away, all eyes will be on the premier cryptocurrency and all that pertains to it over the next couple of weeks. According to a recent on-chain observation, the BTC supply on exchanges has been on a steady decline over the past few months. This trend has sparked discussions on what this could mean for the Bitcoin price, both in the short and long term. $7.55 Billion Transferred Out Of Exchange Wallets In The Past Month Prominent crypto pundit Ali Martinez took to the X platform to share that a significant amount of Bitcoin has been moved out of crypto exchanges over the past month. The relevant metric here is Glassnode’s Balance on Exchanges, which tracks the total amount of a cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this case) held across all exchange addresses. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Go On 1.2 Million BTC Buying Spree, Is Retail Finally Here? A decrease in the value of this indicator implies that investors are making more withdrawals than deposits of Bitcoin into centralized exchanges. The metric’s increase, on the other hand, indicates that more BTC is flowing into these exchanges than leaving. Chart showing Bitcoin balance on all exchanges | Source: Ali_charts/X According to Martinez, about 111,000 BTC (worth approximately $7.55 billion) have been transferred out of known crypto exchange wallets in the past month. Typically, an exodus of funds (of this magnitude) suggests a significant shift in the sentiment of Bitcoin investors. While the exact rationale behind such a massive movement of Bitcoin remains unclear, the flow of funds from trading platforms suggests a growth in investor confidence. This implies that BTC owners are more interested in holding their assets in the long term rather than selling for short-term gains. Furthermore, this continuous downward trend in BTC’s balance on exchanges could set the stage for a bullish rally for the Bitcoin price. A sustained drop in the BTC’s supply on centralized exchanges could result in a supply crunch – a scenario where the supply of a particular asset is lower than its demand, leading to a surge in its value. Another potential bullish catalyst for the Bitcoin price is the upcoming halving event, which is expected to occur on April 18, 2024. With the miners’ rewards slashed in half and the production of Bitcoin slowed, this event is expected to impact the value of BTC positively. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at around $69,537, reflecting a 2.7% increase in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Breakout Of The Year?

Will History Support Bitcoin And Rally To Fresh Highs?

Bitcoin prices trending sideways on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView Presently, the trader said prices are approaching 2017 levels. Then, prices created what the analyst described as a “more subtle initial rise” before peaking six months later at over $20,000. If this leads, and the indicator “pauses” where it is, Bitcoin will likely record a “single top.” However, only time will tell where this top will be at. Hedge Funds Were Selling At Tops? This prediction comes amid significant bearish bets by leveraged hedge funds. Data from the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) reveals that these funds held record “short” positions in Bitcoin futures contracts by last week. Observers note this was the largest short position since 2017, at over 16,000 contracts. By shorting, they expected prices to dump, which is precisely what’s happening at spot rates.

However, even as hedge funds short, another analyst, responding to the trend, said the futures premium remained high. This is a development that some of these crypto hedge funds are taking advantage of. The number of shorts could increase in the days ahead as United States Federal Reserve officials appeared to be hawkish and upbeat economic data started pouring in. Being a data-driven central bank, the Federal Reserve might not slash rates as fast as initially projected.

Since the start of January, PENDLE has seen a remarkable 590% increase in price, with a 220% spike in just the last four weeks alone, making it one of the top-performing assets in the broader cryptocurrency market. This surge aligns with a significant rise in Pendle’s TVL, which escalated from just under $240 million at the beginning of January to over $4.6 billion recently. Related Reading: “Where It Should Be”: Crypto Analyst Remains Firm On $1.7 Prediction For Cardano (ADA) Delving into the reasons behind PENDLE’s impressive trajectory, crypto researcher 100y.eth offered a detailed explanation on X, focusing on the token’s distinct utilities and tokenomics. “Pendle Finance revolutionizes DeFi by allowing the tokenization and separation of yield-bearing tokens into PT (Principal) and YT (Yield), tradable on Pendle’s AMM. This innovation is at the core of Pendle’s current popularity,” the researcher stated. Further shedding light on the factors driving PENDLE’s accumulation, 100y.eth referred to significant whale activity. “According to lookonchain, whales are still in the phase of accumulating PENDLE, a testament to their belief in its long-term value,” the researcher noted, citing substantial withdrawals from exchanges as indicative of investor confidence. Whales continue to accumulate $PENDLE! 0xe675 withdrew 295,443 $PENDLE($1.95M) from #Binance 3 hours ago and 372,752 $PENDLE ($2.46M) from #Binance 3 days ago. 0xAa4c withdrew 115,500 $PENDLE($764K) from #Binance 30 mins ago and 384,500 $PENDLE($2.54M) from #Binance 4 days ago.… pic.twitter.com/w1MZTUHSZp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 10, 2024 The essence of PENDLE’s appeal lies in its vePENDLE system, which enhances its governance model and incentivizes long-term holding. “Magic resides in vePENDLE.

The 30-day period under review has seen a significant fall in Bonk’s daily trading volume, with Santiment’s data indicating a 75% decrease. This decline in trading activity adds further weight to the bearish sentiment surrounding the coin, signaling waning investor interest and confidence in its potential. Source: Santiment Technical Indicators Signal Trouble For Bonk Further exacerbating Bonk’s woes are its momentum indicators, which reveal a troubling discrepancy between distribution and accumulation. The Money Flow Index (MFI) points to increased selling activity, outweighing any attempts at buying and adding further downward pressure on the coin’s value.

A Glimmer Of Hope Amidst The Storm As traders continue to monitor the situation closely, there is potential for a shift in sentiment that could breathe new life into Bonk’s ailing price. For now, the road ahead for Bonk remains uncertain, with technical indicators pointing towards further declines while traders cling to hopes of a reversal.

    "content": "Data shows Bitcoin is currently nearing two notable on-chain price levels. Here’s what happened the last time BTC broke above them. Bitcoin Is Approaching Vaulted Price \u0026 MVRV +1SD Currently In a new post on X, Glassnode leads on-chain analyst Checkmate points out that BTC has been near two on-chain price levels recently. The first of these levels is the “MVRV +1SD.” The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is a famous indicator for Bitcoin. In short, it compares the value that BTC holders are currently carrying (that is, the market cap) against the value they put into the cryptocurrency (the realized cap). Related Reading: Bitcoin 40% Of Way Through Bull Run If This Metric Is To Go By This metric is generally used to determine the scale of profit or loss that the market as a whole is carrying right now. Based on this, the fairness of the coin’s price may be judged. In the context of the current discussion, the +1 standard deviation (SD) of the MVRV ratio from its mean is of relevance. More specifically, the price level at which the market would satisfy this MVRV ratio condition is of focus. The other on-chain level of interest here is the “Vaulted Price.” This indicator is a product of the “Cointime Economics” framework that Checkmate came up with alongside David Puell from Ark Invest. In reference to this metric, the paper reads: Vaulted Realized Price may be considered to be a pricing level that reflects the ‘potential energy’ stored in the system. Somewhat counter-intuitively, the more long-term coin accumulation that takes place, the larger the uncertainty becomes between the proportion of truly lost vs. HODLed supply. Vaulted Realized Price will trade lower in this instance, as more cointime accumulation takes place, and uncertainty regarding future distributive pressure builds (and vice-versa). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in these two indicators, as well as some other “original” on-chain levels, over the past few years: Looks like the asset has been near these two levels in recent weeks | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin spot price earlier broke through the Vaulted Price and went to the MVRV +1SD (note that the labeling is flipped in the chart by mistake, as Checkmate has noted in reply to the post). Since then, the price has come down a bit and is trading under both of these levels. Nonetheless, it currently stands quite near to them and far above the other on-chain price levels like the realized price.

Obviously, what followed then was the bull run of 2021. It remains to be seen how Bitcoin’s interactions with these levels will be this time around and whether a similar euphoric run will follow with a potential break above them.

    "content": "Over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to move significantly to the upside as the leading cryptocurrency has entered a consolidation phase below the $69,000 mark. This subdued volatility departs from Bitcoin’s usual fluctuations, raising speculation about a potential stagnation phase in its market trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Roar: Analysts Predict Surge To $82,000 Amid Bullish Pennant Formation Anticipation Builds For Bitcoin’s Next Rally The cryptocurrency community has closely monitored Bitcoin’s movements, especially as it approaches crucial resistance levels. Insights from prominent crypto analyst Captain Faibik shed light on Bitcoin’s current outlook. Captain Faibik suggests that Bitcoin could be on the brink of a significant breakout, contingent upon surpassing the $70,000 resistance threshold. According to the crypto analyst, the BTC “Bulls must Clear the $70,000 Resistance area to Confirm the upside Breakout.” $BTC is Bouncing back Nicely but still Consolidating within the Triangle. Bulls must Clear the 70k Resistance area to Confirm the upside Breakout.#Crypto #Bitcoin #BTC pic.twitter.com/NxAz8Y1ktq — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) April 5, 2024 Another crypto analyst, Jelle, Echoes similar sentiments and emphasizes the importance of patience among investors, particularly with the impending Bitcoin halving event on the horizon. Notably, the Halving is a pre-programmed event built into the Bitcoin protocol that occurs approximately every four years within the Bitcoin network to reduce the reward for mining new BTC blocks. Despite Bitcoin’s recent consolidation, anticipation for a potential rally above the $70,000 mark continues to build within the crypto community, especially as the halving is now less than 20 days away. This is because the halving ultimately decreases the supply of new BTC, and reduced supply often leads to increased demand and speculative buying. Hope For Bitcoin Bull Run Jelle’s analysis underscores the historical precedent of Bitcoin’s price movements, noting that previous all-time highs were often preceded by periods of consolidation and uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin Teeters On The Edge Of Glory: Will It Smash The $70,000 Resistance? Drawing attention to bullish indicators such as the pennant formation and strong support levels, Jelle predicts a breakout in the coming weeks, providing hope for investors seeking upward momentum in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. While #Bitcoin did not break $69,000 in one go, it looks like it’s forming a new higher low here. Hold $66,500, and we’ll be at $69k again soon.

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Recovery Rally: Breaking Through This Level Is Key To Bullish Momentum – Analyst Catalyst That Could Drive Bitcoin To $200,000 According to Tapiero, a significant macroeconomic factor is expected to drive Bitcoin’s price to new heights, offering investors an opportunity for substantial gains. Tapiero’s bullish stance on Bitcoin’s future price trajectory revolves around a unique correlation he observed in the market. Particularly, the expert highlighted concerns about “monetary debasement” driven by a notable 60% increase in the Treasury market over the past five years. This factor leads Tapiero to anticipate a surge beyond $200,000 for the digital gold, Bitcoin. While acknowledging the potential for gold to perform well in such a scenario, Tapiero remains particularly bullish on Bitcoin’s prospects.

With a 2.6% increase over the week and a 3.1% surge in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s upward trajectory continues to attract attention from investors and analysts alike. BTC price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com Notably, the current price performance of the asset coincides with a notable event: over 600 BTC of $100,000 strike call options have recently been traded in a Block trade. This significant development, as illuminated by Greek Live, carries a notional value of up to $45 million, with $8.5 million worth of premiums alone. Greeks Live further reported that this occurrence has propelled the entire market into a prolonged bullish momentum. In addition, with the halving event on the horizon, the prospect of reaching new all-time highs, including the milestone of $100,000, appears to be within reach. Bitcoin broke through the $70,000 zone without warning, one step away from a new all-time high.

    "content": "After a relatively stable period, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has slightly disappointed meme coin enthusiasts over the past week. After a period of solid growth, $DOGE experienced a drop in value, and now, unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like such a good option anymore. Although $DOGE has witnessed a price drop in the last seven days, crypto users hope that the situation could turn around and this meme coin could return to its old ways thanks to the upcoming Doge Day. However, everything points to the fact that another dog-themed meme coin will achieve much greater success with Doge Day approaching. It is the young Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20). This fresh meme coin has recorded astonishing results from the very start. Experts believe its peak will happen right after Doge Day, which is its launch day! \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy The Best Crypto Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Dogecoin ($DOGE) sees a significant weekly price drop while interest in its fresh alternative grows! Meme coin enthusiasts have eagerly awaited Doge Day and the Bitcoin Halving, believing that this is when Dogecoin ($DOGE) could shine! However, this positive sentiment towards Dogecoin has decreased dramatically over the past seven days, as $DOGE has experienced a price drop. Meme coin enthusiasts are now interested in what could happen with Dogecoin in the coming period. Will $DOGE continue last week’s downward trend, or is there still a possibility that this meme coin could bring joy to investors? Crypto influencer Trader Tardigrade believes that Dogecoin could pull itself out of this situation and reach a value of $2, $9, or even $40. Rekt Capital is not so optimistic about this meme coin and believes that in the best case, $DOGE could rally towards $0.30. But, to get a better perspective, let’s see what price predictions suggest for this meme coin for 2024. MONTH MINIMUM PRICE MAXIMUM PRICE APRIL $0.158 $0.187 MAY $0.143 $0.169 JUNE $0.139 $0.153 JULY $0.125 $0.153 AUGUST $0.116 $0.116 SEPTEMBER $0.101 $0.164 OCTOBER $0.0785 $0.157 NOVEMBER $0.0901 $0.0983 DECEMBER $0.0892 $0.0985 As you can see, the predictions for Dogecoin ($DOGE) for 2024 are not overly optimistic. Despite the hopes of meme coin enthusiasts, $DOGE will not be able to achieve any significant results this year. However, a new meme coin star has emerged in the meme coin community, causing quite a buzz. Dogeocin20 ($DOGE), a cryptocurrency generating significant interest as its launch day approaches, is capturing the spotlight. Let’s explore if this coin has the potential to outshine $DOGE and other popular meme coins. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Dogecoin20 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Crypto users focus on a new meme coin star, Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20)! The popular Dogecoin ($DOGE) may not be able to achieve any significant results during 2024, but the young meme coin star Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) could do so. The era of dog-themed meme coins is not over, and the $DOGE20 success so far speaks in favor of that. However, we should not ignore that Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) is not an ordinary dog-themed meme coin but a crypto that carries real utility and provides its investors with many opportunities. The opportunity to win staking rewards is particularly attractive to investors. Early investors are in the best position regarding staking rewards, so this is probably one of the reasons why Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) experienced such initial success. In record time, the Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) completed its presale with over $10 million raised, but users’ interest stayed the same even after that. As the launch day approaches, more and more crypto users notice the progress of this meme coin, become aware of its potential, and strive to grab it as soon as possible. If you missed investing in this meme coin during the presale, you will be glad to hear you have another chance to place this young meme coin star in your crypto portfolio! \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Dogecoin20 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c As launch day approaches, Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) surges and becomes increasingly popular! Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) has already earned the epithet “the best meme coin to buy now,” which is undoubtedly one of the factors that made it so desirable. However, even though the presale has ended, investors want to use this last chance to buy $DOGE20 at a unique price of only $0.00022 because they know this meme coin could bring them a lot. Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) launches on Doge Day, so hurry and invest in this 100x potential meme coin immediately! \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Dogecoin20 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Conclusion The fact that the “original” Dogecoin ($DOGE) experienced a significant drop in value last week does not mean that the meme coin mania is over. It does not even mean that the interest in dog-themed meme coins has decreased, and the growing hype around Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) speaks in support of that! As Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) prepares to launch on Doge Day, the clock is ticking for those who want to seize this last chance to buy this meme coin at a great price! If you failed to get Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) during the presale, do your best to correct that mistake and use the chance to grab it for just $0.00022.

    "content": "As the crypto space eagerly awaits the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event, top crypto analyst Willy Woo has emerged with a bullish prediction that has stirred considerable excitement among enthusiasts. Woo particularly underscored the potential for Bitcoin’s price to surge dramatically, using the term “ballistic” to describe the expected trajectory post-Halving. Notably, Bitcoin’s Halving is an integral component of its protocol. It occurs approximately every four years and reduces miners’ reward for validating transactions on the blockchain. This event also effectively reduces the rate at which new BTC enters circulation, increasing the asset’s scarcity and potentially impacting its price dynamics. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Warns Of Burgeoning Bitcoin Fire Sale, Here’s What It Means Bitcoin Would Go ‘Ballistic’ Based On This Woo’s analysis delves into the profound implications of the impending Halving, particularly regarding Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. The cryptocurrency experiences an annual supply growth rate of 1.7%, which will be halved to 0.85% following the upcoming event. This reduction favors Bitcoin’s supply growth rate compared to traditional assets like gold, which boasts an annual supply growth rate of approximately 1.6%. Moreover, Woo juxtaposes Bitcoin’s supply growth against the US dollar, characterized by a negative growth rate attributed to inflation. As the USD supply growth trends back to a standard range of 5% to 10%, Woo anticipates a momentous surge in Bitcoin’s price, driven by its inherent scarcity and growing recognition as a hedge against inflationary pressures. 10 days to the halvening… #Bitcoin‘s annual supply growth drops from 1.7% to 0.85%. This beat’s gold’s number of 1.6% (gold supply doubles every 44yrs) USD is -1.7% right now in its fight against inflation. Normal range is 5-10%, when it reverts, BTC goes ballistic. pic.twitter.com/IQNOseFmQB — Willy Woo (@woonomic) April 9, 2024 Diverging Perspectives On BTC Trajectory While Woo’s bullish forecast sets an optimistic tone for Bitcoin’s future, recent insights from a consumer survey conducted by Deutsche Bank present a more nuanced perspective. The survey findings reveal a palpable division among respondents regarding Bitcoin’s trajectory, with approximately one-third expressing negativity about its price prospects. These individuals anticipate Bitcoin’s value to plummet below $20,000 by year-end, representing a stark deviation from the prevailing bullish sentiment. Adding to the discourse, Authur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, offers a dissenting view characterized by a bearish outlook on Bitcoin’s post-halving performance. In a comprehensive analysis shared via a blog post, Hayes outlines his concerns regarding the potential for a significant price decline after the halving. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Resumes Upside, Why BTC Could Soon Hit New ATH While many analysts anticipate a bullish rally during the halving period, Hayes posits a scenario in which Bitcoin experiences a more subdued trajectory, emphasizing the need for careful consideration amid heightened market volatility.

    "content": "The much-anticipated arrival of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US seems to be hitting a snag. Industry leaders are voicing growing concerns about the likelihood of securing regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with a deafening silence from the agency fueling anxieties. Related Reading: Bitcoin Below $70,000: Is $80K Still Possible, Or Is The Rally Over? Jan van Eck, CEO of investment firm VanEck, recently cast a shadow of doubt on the possibility of SEC approval for spot Ether ETFs in May. In a CNBC interview, van Eck expressed his belief that their application would likely be rejected, citing a complete lack of communication from the regulatory body. This sentiment finds an echo in the words of Eric Balchunas, a Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst, who has significantly downgraded his odds of approval to a mere 35%. Balchunas attributes this pessimism to the ongoing “radio silence” between the SEC and fund issuers. Nice scoop from @joelight. Def interesting but no change our odds. As we’ve said, need SEC to give comments on the filing documents (the “critical feedback” he mentions) and that still ain’t happening, even in person they offering nothing. Silence is violence. https://t.co/z76KTtdmHU — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 8, 2024 Ethereum ETF Applications Languish In SEC Limbo The SEC’s lack of response extends beyond van Eck’s application. Seven other proposals for spot Ether ETFs are currently gathering dust, with no indication of progress. This regulatory purgatory is fueling skepticism among industry commentators. CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti believes that approval for any of these applications is unlikely “this side of the year,” further amplifying the prevailing uncertainty. Ethereum is now trading at $3561.8. Chart: TradingView The current roadblock for Ethereum ETFs stands in stark contrast to the success story of Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC’s green light for Bitcoin ETFs offered a glimmer of hope for the cryptocurrency market. Van Eck highlights the growing interest in Bitcoin as a “maturing asset class,” with significant untapped investor demand. Notably, VanEck’s own spot Bitcoin ETF, known by the ticker HODL, has witnessed significant inflows since its launch in mid-January, signifying a strong investor appetite for crypto exposure. Lack Of Clarity Creates Murky Investment Landscape The lack of interaction from the SEC is a major concern for James Seyffart, another analyst in the field. He emphasizes that “zero comments or interactions from the SEC is a bad sign.” This sentiment suggests a troubling trend in the approval process, further dampening hopes for a swift resolution on the Ethereum ETF front.

This indicates that opportunities for investment diversification in the digital realm are on the rise. However, until the SEC sheds light on its stance, investors and industry stakeholders will be forced to navigate a landscape fraught with uncertainty and intense regulatory scrutiny. The path forward for Ethereum ETFs remains shrouded in doubt. The SEC’s silence is deafening, and industry leaders are bracing for potential rejection. With a lack of clear communication and mounting skepticism, investors are left facing a blank wall, waiting for a sign from the SEC.

    "content": "The crypto industry is an ever-evolving industry where new projects ascend to dominance and make investors millionaires within a short time. Currently, a top crypto project is in the ascendancy and looking to oust top meme coins like Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Pepe, etc. The meme project, which is still at its presale stage, is showcasing exponential growth potential that is capable of turning its investors into millionaires within a year. This meme coin is no other than KangaMoon (KANG). Here, you’ll find an in-depth analysis of the KANG project and why experts believe it will become the next blue-chip crypto. KangaMoon (KANG) Sets Blueprint for a Massive Meme Empire KangaMoon (KANG) is coming into the crypto industry armed with a strategic investment groundwork that’ll trump most of the top meme coins in the market, including Shiba Inu. For context, KangaMoon is setting up one of the biggest meme platforms that will act as a meeting place for meme enthusiasts. The KangaMoon platform has two standout features which include the SocialFi structure and the GameFi feature. Through the SocialFi structure, meme enthusiasts can meet and interact with like-minds on the Kangaverse. On the other hand, the GameFi feature facilitates a play-to-earn environment where members can journey through the gaming adventure while earning valuable rewards that include NFTs, collectibles, and KANG tokens. It’s no wonder then that over 20,000 meme enthusiasts have already joined the platform. While still in its presale phase, the KangaMoon project has already recorded an ROI of 290%.. There’s more growth to come for KANG, given that the token is set to hit CEX exchanges in Q2. As such, investing in the KANG presale for only $0.0196 is the best strategy to position oneself for the massive exponential growth potential. Crypto experts have projected 100x rallies in the coming months. That means the KANG price could hit $1 sooner than anticipated. Overall, KangaMoon is an emerging meme project that will serve as both a profitable investment venture for traders as well as an entertaining platform for meme enthusiasts on the blockchain. Accessing the Shiba Inu Project and Why KangaMoon May Outshine it Shiba Inu (SHIB) was one of the best meme coins in the meme coin market when it was launched in August 2020. The Ethereum-based token is the second most valued meme coin by market capitalization according to market stats. However, unlike KangaMoon, the Shiba Inu token harbors no significant utility. Meanwhile, the KANG token is a utility token of an emerging, high-potential KangaMoon meme platform. The KangaMoon platform is also an upgraded version of Shiba Inu’s Shibarium metaverse. This is because while the Shibarium metaverse allows members to interact and earn in-game rewards, it doesn’t rely entirely on the Shiba Inu token, as members can easily boycott the token in favor of ETH to make transactions. This lowers the utility of the SHIB token. Meanwhile, KANG remains the only utility token of the Kangaverse, a development that will increase the value of KANG over time.

    "content": "Ethereum Layer-2 solutions to hit $1 trillion in market cap by 2023 based on data from investment manager VanEck. According to the report, they can capitalize on Ethereum’s primary challenge, its limited capacity to process, store and compute data. Two of the largest scaling solutions include Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP), which have seen solid price performance as-well. However, another project built on Ethereum is also rising, and that’s KangaMoon (KANG) which spiked 290%. Today, we will go over their price performance to see how far they can rise, and to see which will be one of the top DeFi projects. KangaMoon (KANG) Up 290% KangaMoon (KANG) can experience a remarkable level of growth as it has already begun to dominate the charts following its monumental rise in value from $0.005 to $0.0196 marking a 290% increase. It’s also raised over $4.3 million and can raise $4.7 million during the week. The key reason for this massive momentum is because the crypto goes beyond the classic trope of meme coins and introduces a vast ecosystem that rewards players with massive token utility. On top of the platform, there is a Play-to-Earn (P2E) element, coupled with Social-Fi features and a community-driven approach. Players can create their own KangaMoon character and through it, can enter tournaments, fights, or even place bets on battles in order to get rewards in the form of KANG tokens or NFTs. In fact, there are now over 5,800 KANG holders, and the community has over 20,000 registered users. Based on the latest analyst projections, the crypto can spike 100x following its launch, making it one of the top DeFi projects. Arbitrum (ARB) to Spike to $2.32 by the End of Q4, 2024 Arbitrum (ARB) has displayed a price correction phase in the short-term, where it dipped 30.3% in the past 30 days. However, the year-to-date (YTD) climb for the Arbitrum price was by 24%, and during the past week, it moved up from $1.44 to $1.69. If the Layer-2 solutions for Ethereum do hit $1 trillion in market cap, the Arbitrum crypto has massive growth potential, and could soon regain significant bullish attention. According to the Arbitrum price prediction, it can end 2024 at $2.32. Optimism (OP) to Reach $5.50 by the End of the Year Optimism (OP) is another Layer-2 scaling solution which showcased a year-to-date (YTD) growth of 43%. Moreover, during the previous week, the Optimism price spiked from a low point of $3.02 to $3.79, and at this rate, it is closer towards breaking the $4 price barrier. Moreover, according to the on-chart metrics, the Optimism crypto’s RSI and MACD data are optimistic, and signal a potential price uptrend. According to the Optimism price prediction, by Q4, 2024, it can reach $5.50. Summary It’s clear that Layer-2 solutions are the future, and with that in mind Arbitrum and Optimism have major growth potential. For the time being, the most bullish performance was however experienced by KangaMoon which has surged 290% and can reach a growth of 100x following its launch. These aspects position it as the best DeFi crypto to jump into in 2024 and beyond. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) Presale Today!

    "content": "Bitcoin has again experienced a price decline since briefly climbing above the $72,000 mark on April 8. This price dip is believed to be due to a couple of factors, which no doubt present a bearish outlook for the flagship crypto. Inflation Data Expected To Come In Hot The March Consumer Price Index (CPI) data is scheduled to be released on April 10. Some market experts predict that the report will show a rise in overall inflation. This could lead to the Federal Reserve taking a hawkish stance on interest rates, negatively impacting Bitcoin’s price and the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Bullish Reversal In On-Chain Metrics, Can SHIB Price Recover? This would explain why Bitcoin’s price has declined lately, as crypto investors remain on the sidelines ahead of the CPI report. However, if the inflation figures come in favorable, this could restore investors’ confidence in the economic situation and provide a much-needed bullish outlook for the crypto market. Also, considering that January and February’s inflation data exceeded expectations, it is necessary to highlight what last month’s data exceeding expectations could mean in the long term. So far, the Fed has continued to hold interest rates steady at about 5.3%, and there was even optimism at the beginning of the year that there could be rate cuts at some point this year. However, with inflation continuing to stay well above the Central Bank’s target of 2%, there is a growing feeling that they might be forced to take drastic measures at some point. That is ultimately not good for Bitcoin’s price, especially since different crypto analysts gave bullish predictions partly based on their assumption that there would be several rate cuts this year. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Back In The Red The Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also contributed to Bitcoin’s recent decline. These investment funds experienced a net outflow on April 8 and 9, leading to a significant Bitcoin dump on the market. Specifically, these outflows came from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which recorded an outflow of $303.3 million and $154.9 million on April 8 and 9, respectively. Related Reading: VeChain On The Edge: Insider Says VET Will Reach The Finish Line Meanwhile, the other Spot Bitcoin ETFs have not recorded impressive inflows during this period, which shows their demand has slowed. For context, 6 out of the 10 Spot Bitcoin ETFs (excluding GBTC) recorded zero inflows on April 9, while 5 out of 10 recorded zero inflows on April 8. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) also recorded a relatively low inflow of $21.3 million that day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $69,300, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
