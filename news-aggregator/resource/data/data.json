    "content": "In what could be the most pivotal year for Bitcoin since it was invented, Muneeb Ali, CEO of Trust Machines and co-creator of the Stacks blockchain, thinks the network\u0027s scalable layer 2s are poised for a breakout. This isn�t just because bitcoin (BTC) has been setting new all-time highs on a weekly basis recently � largely driven by the introduction of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) � but because, more and more, people are using the first cryptocurrency for its intended purpose: as money.\nThe introduction of the Ordinals protocol, the rise of Bitcoin-based BRC-20 tokens and the increasing sophistication of the network�s �smart contracts� via things like BitVM have all contributed to the reinvigoration of Bitcoin�s �fee economy,� i.e. the price paid to make a BTC transaction.\nThis feature is part of CoinDesk�s �Future of Bitcoin� package published to coincide with the 4th Bitcoin �halving� in April 2024.\nIn other words, people are not just buying and holding bitcoin anymore, but using it.\n�Yes, the larger use case remains that bitcoin is a savings technology,� Ali told CoinDesk in an interview. Ali is a veteran developer who got his start working on one of Satoshi Nakamoto�s interests, creating an on-chain domain naming system called the Bitcoin Name Service (BNS) in 2014.\n�But if you\u0027re talking about $1.4 trillion in [deployed Bitcoin] capital, if people keep 80% of that in savings, there\u0027s still hundreds of billions of dollars of BTC that\u0027s available� to be put to productive use.\nAli predicts that most of this action will happen on Bitcoin layer 2s like Lightning, LayerTwo Labs�s �drivechains� or secondary solutions like Stacks, which are all attempts to solve the same problem of scaling Bitcoin and making it more affordable to use. It�s conceivable in the future that there could be daily bitcoin users who never send an on-chain transaction on the base layer, he said.\nCoinDesk caught up with Ali last week to discuss Stacks� long-in-the-works Nakamoto upgrade, what he appreciates about other app-optimized networks like Ethereum and Solana and the �revival of interest in Bitcoin layer 2s.� The following interview has been lightly edited and abbreviated.\nStacks has been around for a long time, and, to your credit, it has continually innovated. The upcoming Nakamoto upgrade has been in progress for a few years. Answer honestly: Has Stacks built up technical debt � or were there decisions you made earlier that limit what you can do today or that make certain things more difficult?\nThere\u0027s definitely technical debt from a code perspective, right? If you already have a code base, and you\u0027re upgrading it, there\u0027s friction when making changes live and in production. I\u0027ll give you an example: Today, there\u0027s $1.4 billion in STX capital that is locked in consensus right now. The first thing that\u0027s going to happen is that people are going to unlock their capital and lock it in the new consensus protocol � that�s $1.4 billion getting unlocked in one place and moved, versus just launching a new system.\nAt the same time, I would emphasize that this is exactly the type of challenge that Bitcoin layer 2s should be able to take on. It�s what makes the whole system durable. L2s move fast. Bitcoin is not going to change much. L2s are innovative and open to making rapid changes. After a while it becomes part of their culture. These days, I\u0027m seeing �XYZ ecosystem� have a cadence of one major upgrade every six months: That would be very healthy for Bitcoin.\nFragmentation of layer 2s on Ethereum is an emerging issue for that network. Are you thinking that Bitcoin is going to need layer 3s eventually?\nWe are already seeing this. Stacks has this thing called Bitcoin subnets � the work is done but it was never really fully launched because there\u0027s so much focus on Nakamoto right now. The basic concept is to use Stacks to do the logic and security in the middle in between subnets, which could be more permissioned, while putting all of the state from the subnet onto the Bitcoin layer 1. This allows you to use BTC liquidity. That\u0027s exactly the type of stuff that people call layer 3s, where you can reuse bits and pieces of different L1 and L2 components.\nWe�re developing these SDKs [software development kits] that can help developers use Stacks subsets to � I\u0027ll give you an example. Let\u0027s say someone wants to use the Bitcoin layer 1 as the data availability layer, but the huge signer network that Stacks has, with its $1.4 billion locked today, its decentralized group of signers and 30+ institutions. So they can pick and choose to use the signers from the L2 to build an interesting application. That\u0027s an interesting area as things become more modular, and we will definitely be keeping an eye on whether Stacks emerges as a leading L2 that can be reused in quote unquote L3s. I think that\u0027s something developers will really like.\nIs this able to communicate with Lightning?\nNot a lot of people know this, but Stacks is already connected with Lightning. There is this protocol called LNSwap that can swap satoshis on Lightning to assets on Stacks using an atomic swap. You can begin to extend that functionality because Stacks is almost like a routing layer for subnets. Anything Stacks has been connected to subnets are connected to, which is a huge benefit.\nWhat do you make of the state of the oracle ecosystem on Bitcoin?\nSome of the direct conversations that I\u0027ve had with oracle developers is about how they find it hard to be directly integrated with Bitcoin. That�s common: Bitcoin has an eloquent scripting language, but it�s really hard to work with and it�s limited in what it can do. Interestingly, Stacks has a type of oracle service where through the mining process, people get a native feed of the BTC/STX price pair, because that bidding is happening on-chain � it�s like an on-chain oracle for STX/BTC prices. Some people find that interesting.\nI will say right now, oracles on Bitcoin L1 are sort of limited. They mostly work, let\u0027s say we have some off-chain oracle that controls a multisig � they\u0027re not state of the art oracles like on Ethereum or Solana. On L2s, Pyth [Network, a cross-chain oracle solution] is already live and other oracles are coming as well that can try to fill that gap as best as possible. It�ll be a huge step forward because it sort of connects the dots and allows for more expressive contracts that have full functionality like Solana or Ethereum. It would dramatically increase the programmability of Bitcoin.\nAre there unseen dangers to increasing the programmability of a system designed to be rather limited? There�s a version of this debate playing out already with Ordinals and the like.\nI think, with BitVM, there was an accidental discovery that Bitcoin is already Turing complete. There�s a caveat: these programs are pretty inefficient to build. It\u0027s technically true that with BitVM you can pretty much build any application. But the reality is nowhere close to having full smart contracts. Because BitVM programs are mostly off-chain, they\u0027re not directly impacting anything � just the proving steps are happening on bitcoin L1, which are pretty limited.\nIf Bitcoin changed its script to something like EVM that would be a drastic change, right? Like you suddenly open yourself up to all sorts of things. With BitVM, yes there are new features, but it�s pretty limited.\nThat said, with Taproot we have seen that even with limited additional functionality, people can build new things. So I definitely think people will try a lot of new things. What I am excited about with BitVM are very targeted applications, because it\u0027s usually an inefficient way of writing a program. For example, a trustless bridge. A trustless bridge is actually not impacting the L1 that much at all because all the functionality lives on the L2. That\u0027s a great use of BitVM because the L1 is still protected. People might try to do other things with BitVM as well. But it\u0027s a very heavy load, all these programs are very complicated and inefficient.\nThere�s a claim to make that you\u0027re the Bitcoin maxi who most closely follows developments happening on other chains. Is there anything at all that you admire about Ethereum or Solana?\nIt�s actually interesting, right? I was with some other Bitcoin people and it was sort of surprising to me how little they follow happenings elsewhere in the industry. I\u0027ll give you a concrete example where I think there could be a benefit.\nEveryone wants to support Bitcoin Core development; they are doing thankless work and there should be better ways of supporting them. I brought up the point that these other ecosystems actually have very bright engineers. Algorand, for example, has PhDs from MIT � like really smart people who have built a real blockchain and have experience running production systems. But there\u0027s no good way of learning from their experiences.\nHow do you hire and retain these people? How do you incentivize them? The rest of the blockchain ecosystem is actually pretty competitive. When we try to hire Core devs for Trust Machines, we compete with Solana Labs and Avalanche. It\u0027s a very competitive market, but Bitcoin is missing in action. Like, they\u0027re not even playing that game. There are a ton of lessons that can be taken from the rest of the industry that can be funneled into Bitcoin Core, that can make core development more efficient, better funded, with better talent.\nYou probably get a version of this question and every interview you do, but all available evidence suggests people want to hold bitcoin. 70% of addresses are unmoved. Flows into ETFs suggest that people are putting bitcoin into long term savings. Why believe the Bitcoin smart contracts space will ever grow as large as Ethereum?\nI do get that question a lot. The way I think about this is: I have my bitcoin savings in cold storage and some capital that I want to experiment with. That capital could be ETH capital or SOL capital � but it just as easily can be BTC capital. The simple fact is it�s much better to have BTC capital � that\u0027s the division, right? And people spend bitcoin.\nPeople forget that the Ethereum ICO [initial coin offering] happened in BTC. $18 million raised in BTC and it sold out. Rootstock raised 35,000 BTC. If you look at ordinals traffic, some of the new NFTs like Taproot Wizards when they launched Quantum Cats. It sold out in BTC. So I feel the data suggests that people actually deploy their bitcoin.\nYes, the larger use case remains that bitcoin is a savings technology. But if you\u0027re talking about $1.4 trillion in capital, if people keep 80% of that in savings, there\u0027s still hundreds of billions of dollars of BTC that\u0027s available. That\u0027s more than any other chain, minus Ethereum, that is available to deploy and put to productive use.\nThen there�s the institutional use. Right now, there�s no direct, decentralized way to safely earn yield on their BTC. BlockFi blew up. DeFi didn�t, not even during the bear market. If there\u0027s a healthy, decentralized smart contract option that could turn bitcoin into a productive asset from a passive, no yield asset. That�d accelerate institutional adoption.\nI mean, institutions may reject that for similar reasons Bitcoiners may be hesitant: you\u0027re introducing smart contract risk.\nIt is a risk, right? But there�s risk-to-reward ratios in every market. There are different ways of doing it, too. There�s work being done so that people can keep their BTC in DLCs on the layer 1 where the BTC only moves to the L2 if you get liquidated. But if you get liquidated, it�s not your bitcoin anyway. Right? So DLC is likely a very safe way of keeping your bitcoin while still participating in DeFi. And on a spectrum I think it�s way safer than giving your BTC to a company.\nObviously people value their bitcoin and don�t want to lose it. But that doesn\u0027t mean free market solutions shouldn\u0027t exist to earn yield. If some people want to take more risk with a subset of their BTC holdings, they should be free to do so and right now those options don\u0027t exist. My gut feeling is that there\u0027s actually a lot of demand, too.\nIf you could do it over again, would you still do the Reg A+ token listing?\nWe still, in some ways, get some benefit from that. It helps people know the offering was transparent and fully legal � it builds credibility for the ecosystem. Another thing that it did was it actually forced decentralization [of Stacks] very, very early, before the mainnet launch. The original company exists in some form, but everyone involved went off and formed independent companies and pursued different things. It is an actual ecosystem. There\u0027s no equivalent of a Solana Labs that does all the work. On the flip side, it\u0027s harder to coordinate across so many different entities.\nThere have been other challenges. For example, many exchanges, especially in the U.S., didn\u0027t understand the Reg A+ offering and were hesitant to list the token. People weren\u0027t used to the process. It\u0027s a mixed bag, but overall I need to be grateful for the opportunity. Ultimately it gives a lot of transparency and credibility to the project.\nYou get a lot of hate on Twitter from Bitcoiners especially. Under every post someone either asks why you launched a token or calls you a scammer. How do you personally stay motivated in such a hostile space?\nHonestly, it\u0027s getting much better. It was the Dark Ages of Bitcoin before. What helped me is that people I really respect � the OGs of Bitcoin like Erik Voorhees, Jameson Lopp and a lot of other people � are very supportive. Minus a few, like Adam Back, which bothered me more. Like Adam, why aren\u0027t you getting it?\nIn person, I have more friendly conversations with everybody. Also, a lot of criticism is coming from the people who joined Bitcoin during the quote unquote Dark Ages and I just view them as having incomplete information. Bitcoin is a free-market solution. When you don�t understand Bitcoin you say something like, �you can do X but not Y on the network.�\nThe other thing is it\u0027s getting a lot better because there are new builders coming and new tools being built. There�s excitement in the builders community. It\u0027s sort of a mindset, or at some level, a personality thing.\nI joke that the number one quality in the type of person who actually finished their PhD is being stubborn. If you\u0027re stubborn about an idea, you really believe in it, you keep taking the punches, right? Then it�s a satisfying feeling when you cross the finish line.\n",

    "content": "Expectations that a crypto project will be mentioned in an Nvidia (NVDA) conference later this month are driving traders to bid on artificial intelligence (AI)-linked tokens, propelling CoinGecko \u0027s category for the coins up 25% in 24 hours.\nTokens of Fetch.AI (FET), Render Network (RNDR), Sleepless AI (AI) and SingularityNET (AGIX) climbed as much as 40%. These projects claim to utilize AI in various ways, such as providing a virtual companion and being a marketplace for graphic processing cards.\nBehind the surge are reports that crypto AI project developers are attending the chipmaker\u0027s conference or taking part in panels, according to Lookonchain. The event will be held from March 17-21. The advance compares with bitcoin�s 0.3% increase and a 0.4% gain in the CoinDesk 20, a broad-based liquid index of major tokens.\nAI tokens remain a hot narrative for crypto traders because the technology is expected to drive key innovations in the global economy in the coming years. However, the relationship between AI and crypto is unclear: Artifical intelligence cannot run on a blockchain. Even so, developments in traditional AI companies, such as OpenAI, drive gains in AI tokens as traders utilize them as a proxy bet on the industry.\nThe tokens also rallied last month after Nvidia beat fourth-quarter earnings and first-quarter guidance expectations.\nMeanwhile, the inflows into AI tokens seem to have put the brakes on a multiweek rally for meme coins, data shows.\nTokens such as dogecoin (DOGE), pepecoin (PEPE) and dogwifhat (WIF) have more than doubled over the past few weeks as bitcoin briefly broke its all-time highs. Some observers attributed the surge to meme coins being more friendly to retail traders, who are typically driven to crypto markets during bitcoin rallies.\nThe rally seems to be done for now. DOGE, SHIB and PEPE lost over 15% in the past 24 hours, data shows. And in another sign of money leaving the market, open interest on DOGE-tracked futures has dropped $400 million from record highs since Tuesday.\n",

Since 2021, the cryptocurrency sector has seen huge turmoil with the crash of FTX, leading to regulatory changes across the world.\n�This is a long-awaited expansion that gives regulatory clarity to key parts of the crypto ecosystem, such as custody services,� said Angela Ang, a senior policy adviser for blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs and a former MAS regulator.\nThe amendments would impose user protection and financial stability-related requirements on digital payment tokens (DPT) or cryptocurrency service providers.\nThe amendments include �segregating customers� assets and placing them in a trust account for the benefit of customers, maintaining proper books and records, and ensuring that effective systems and controls are in place� and will take effect within six months from April 4, 2024.\nAny entity that is already conducting crypto-related activities under the Payment Services Act will need to start a transition process within 30 days and submit a license application within six months from April 4, 2024, to continue activities temporarily till their application is reviewed.\nThe license application will require an attestation report of compliance with requirements around anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, qualified by an external auditor within nine months.\nEntities that do not comply with these requirements would have to cease all activities, the MAS said.\nRead More: Singapore Central Bank Rules to Discourage Crypto Speculation, Ease Investment Qualifications\n\n\n",

In the short-mid term, I expect a transition back to �fundamentally driven� altcoins,� Heil cautioned.\nBullish demand for ether started to increase in mid-January amid expectations that it would be the next major token after bitcoin (BTC) to get a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S.\nCoinbase premiums for Ethereum ecosystem tokens were higher than usual in the past week, suggesting recent demand was led by U.S. investors, as per CryptoQuant.\n",

    "content": "Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, has said that he is remorseful for his actions after he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud last week.\nBankman-Fried was interviewed via email by ABC News from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Last Thursday, while announcing the sentence, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said Bankman-Fried never offered �a word of remorse� for his �terrible crimes.�\n�It�s most of what I think about each day,� Bankman-Fried told ABC News. �I never thought that what I was doing was illegal. But I tried to hold myself to a high standard, and I certainly didn�t meet that standard. I�ve heard and seen the despair, frustration and sense of betrayal from thousands of customers; they deserve to be paid in full at the current price.�\nThe former FTX boss said the insolvency of FTX was the result of several �bad decisions� he made in 2022. Bankman-Fried also noted that the customers �could and should� have been paid in 2022, and it�s �excruciating to see them waiting, day after day.�\n�I�m haunted, every day, by what was lost. I never intended to hurt anyone or take anyone�s money. But I was the CEO of FTX, I was responsible for what happened to the company, and when you�re responsible, it doesn�t matter why it goes bad. I�d give anything to be able to help repair even part of the damage. I�m doing what I can from prison, but it�s deeply frustrating not to be able to do more,� he said to ABC News.\nOn Thursday, Bankman-Fried�s defense team said it would be appealing. During the interview with ABC News, Bankman-Fried said certain trial testimony �greatly misstated what actually happened,� and his defense was �not allowed to introduce crucial evidence or put on important witnesses.�\nRead all of CoinDesk�s coverage on the Sam Bankman-Fried trial here.\n",

    "type": "Finance",
    "summary": "The Gold Rush product offers a trifecta of attractive return, market exposure and protection from losses.\nThe decentralized derivatives protocol unveiled a high-yield structured product called Gold Rush last week.\nThe basket options strategy involves Tether\u0027s gold-backed token, XAUT, and ether as underlying assets and a safety component that protects users from a 30% drop in the tokens\u0027 prices.\n",
    "content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) projects are continuing to develop structured products, which offer decent returns, market exposure and protection from losses and were previously available only to institutional investors in traditional markets.\nLast week, derivatives protocol Cega unveiled Gold Rush, a basket options strategy involving the Ethereum blockchain\u0027s ether (ETH) token and Tether\u0027s gold-backed {{XAUT}} as underlying assets alongside a safety component that protects users\u0027 capital from a 30% drop in the assets\u0027 prices.\nThe product offers an annualized percentage yield of up to 83% to investors who stake ETH, Lido\u0027s staked ether (stETH), wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), or stablecoin USDC in the option strategy vault, Cega said. The yield is paid out in the form of the coins staked, so, ETH stakers receive ETH in yield, providing an asymmetric upside in a bullish market.\nThe Gold Rush vault went live on March 26. Since then, users have deposited crypto assets worth $2.74 million in the strategy.\n\"Users in DeFi want to stake native assets like ETH or liquid staking tokens like stETH, but don�t want to lose the asymmetric upside on those assets. Users also want safer, higher-yielding opportunities without significant risk to their principal. The new offering, Gold Rush, achieves both of these goals,\" Cega told CoinDesk.\nGold Rush sells 27-day put options with XAUT and ETH as underlying assets. The premium received from market makers who purchase these options is distributed as yield to vault participants.\nOptions are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call gives the right to buy and a put gives the right to sell. A basket option gives the option holder the right to buy or sell the basket of underlying assets, in Cega\u0027s case, ETH and XAUT, at a preset price at a later date.\nThe option has a safety mechanism that protects stakers\u0027 capital against a 30% price drop in XAUT or ETH and has a maturity of 27 days. In other words, the product is suitable for those who do not expect the tokens to drop by more than that over the period.\nIf neither of the assets drop that much, users receive the principal in full, along with the yield, which is accrued daily. On the flip side, if either does breach the 30% downside barrier, the principal returned on expiry is adjusted for the loss from the worst-performing asset. The user still retains the yield.\n\"Users receive downside protection on their deposits against significant market declines, up to 30%. This safety element is an attractive aspect of the fixed coupon note strategy (FCN) owing to a technical feature called a barrier option,\" Cega said in a note to CoinDesk.\nAccording to Cega, even in the worst-case scenario, users earn more than they would from holding long XAUT/USD or ETH/USD positions.\n\"This is because losses are offset by the high daily yield, which is paid regardless of market conditions � and this safety feature also makes FCNs [fixed coupon notes/structured products] attractive for investors,\" Cega said in an explainer.\nCega\u0027s backtesting of the strategy over the past three years showed less than a 3% chance of XAUT or ETH falling by over 30% in 27 days.\nThat said, depositors stand to lose the yield if the market makers who purchased options default. And, as with other DeFi protocols, moving funds on-chain carries a smart contract risk.\n12:25 UTC: Correction: Users have deposited crypto assets worth $2.74 million in the strategy. The previous version erroneously mentioned $297K.\n",
