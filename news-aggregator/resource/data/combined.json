    "summary": "The tool has made over $5 million since going live in early March, with thousands of tokens issued daily.\nPump has generated significant revenue in a short period and zoomed to one of Solana\u0027s highest earning applications, showcasing the profitability of offering token creation services in the crypto space.\nThe platform allows users to create tokens with $2 and offers an inbuilt safety mechanism against scams like rug pulls, making it an attractive option for traders interested in meme coins.\n",
    "content": "Selling shovels in a gold rush was one of the surest ways to make profits, and it’s no different today in the digital asset world.\nPump, a meme coin generator platform, has earned over $5 million in fees since going live in March amid an ongoing meme coin frenzy on Solana, making it one of the biggest revenue-generating applications in a relatively short period.\nThe platform made $300,000 in the past 24 hours alone on Solana, data shows, contributing a significant chunk to the network’s total generated fees of $2.5 million. Annual revenue projections based on current usage and growth are about $66 million, DefiLlama data shows.\nPump lets anyone issue a token for $2 in capital, after which they choose the number of tokens, theme, and meme picture to accompany it. When the market capitalization of any token reaches $69,000, a portion of liquidity is deposited to the Solana-based exchange Raydium and burned. Last week, the platform also extended support to the Blast and Base networks.\nThe draw for traders is a supposed inbuilt safety mechanism: “Rug pulls,” a common crypto scam that sees token issuers drain liquidity, aren’t possible on Pump-issued tokens.\n“Pump prevents rugs by making sure that all created tokens are safe. Each coin on Pump is a fair launch with no pre-sale and no team allocation,” its site says.\nThe ease of usage means new tokens are created nearly every other second. CoinDesk calculated a total of 35 issuances in a one-minute period in Asian morning hours on Tuesday, although this figure is likely to wildly change based on timezones and interest in new types of memes.\nWhile there are likely tens of thousands of tokens that have been released on Pump since its March launch, only a few have reached market capitalizations of more than $10 million.\nThe largest tokens so far are Shark Cat (SC), a cat wearing a shark cap, and Hobbes, named after the cat of popular Solana trader Ansem, with valuations of $100 million and $35 million, respectively.\nCat memes are a popular draw for issuers, although popular Pump tokens range from a can of Arizona Iced Tea and Lord of the Rings character Gandalf to a pixelated image of a rubber duck.\n",

    "content": "After the successful launches of the spot bitcoin ETFs in the US, the next question is whether ether ETFs will be approved, with a May SEC decision looming. David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, and Purvi Maniar, the company\u0027s general counsel, discuss the considerations of such an approval and present the case that it’s likely when not if.\nI provide insights into how crypto ETF approvals have driven regulatory certainty in other regions in Ask an Expert.\n–S.M.\nYou’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.\nA notable theme in the ongoing bull market is Ethereum\u0027s (ETH) underperformance, which has deepened over the past few weeks due to increasing skepticism about the odds of the spot ETF decision being approved by the SEC on May 23.\nThe ETH/BTC price ratio just dipped below 0.05, marking its lowest point since Ethereum began gaining traction as an institutional-grade asset in May 2021.\nAs late as February of 2024, the market was anticipating a green light from the SEC on May 23 following the spot BTC ETF approvals in January 202. This view has been turning sour over the past few weeks, to the point that the current prevailing view is a denial by the SEC. The discount to NAV on the closed-ended Ethereum trust ETHE, a proxy for the market-implied likelihood of denial, increased from 8% to over 25% in the past month.\nSpot ETH ETFs will remain a topic of conversation for the markets as we approach May 23 and the next few quarters if they are not approved by then. Let’s explore what the main arguments for and against approval are.\nPoint (the Consensus View): The Case for Denial\nOver the past few weeks, the market has been trending toward expecting the SEC not to approve a spot ETH ETF at the end of May. This line of argument hinges on a few points.\nFirst, there has been virtually no engagement between the SEC and issuers less than two months from the deadline. This contrasts sharply with the spot BTC approval process, where a back-and-forth was publicly visible through a flurry of amendment filings in the months leading to the approval. Contrary to what some have argued, the recent public call for comments is standard and should not be construed as engagement from the regulator.\nAnother critical factor is the view that the SEC approved the spot BTC ETF approval only begrudgingly. The use cases that ETH currently enables, such as decentralized finance, may make the review process for the SEC more fraught with complexities.\nOne such nuance is the continued lack of confirmation by the SEC on whether ETH is or is not a security despite its sister agency CFTC claiming it is a commodity.\nCounterpoint: The Case for Approval\nSome investors and analysts are making persuasive arguments against the mainstream narrative of denial, even if they are not necessarily calling for a May approval.\nAs Grayscale’s chief legal officer suggested, the absence of engagement does not necessarily predict the outcome. Contrary to the BTC spot ETF approval process, there isn’t much to discuss now. Most of the back-and-forth between the BTC ETF issuers and the SEC was around the redemption mechanism (cash versus in-kind), which is already a settled issue.\nThe one area where there may be room for discussion would be whether the SEC would allow native staking of ETH. Despite the push by some issuers, the broad view is that staking is unlikely to be allowed initially. That’s a straightforward issue the SEC can resolve at a potential rule-change approval or later when it reviews the S1 (or S3) forms required before launch.\nIn addition, a denial would likely be met with litigation from the applicants, and there is strong evidence that the issuers would have a strong case. The spot BTC ETF approval hinged on the high correlation between the spot BTC and CME BTC futures markets According to analyses by Fidelity, Bitwise and Coinbase, the same level correlations also exist for ETH, making it an unlikely issue for the SEC to raise again.\nLooking Ahead\nThe spot BTC ETF approval in January did not come by a wide margin. Two of the five SEC commissioners voted in favor, two against, and Chair Garry Gensler tipped the scale. Gensler’s may be the casting vote again for the spot ETH ETF decision.\nOut of the over 575 ETFs BlackRock has filed as an issuer, only one was denied by the SEC. Will the spot ETH ETF be the second? The market is attributing relatively high odds of denial, but if there’s one thing crypto investors have learned over the years, it\u0027s that last-minute surprises should never be ruled out.\nGoing beyond this approval cycle ending on May 23, it seems only a matter of “when” and not “if” for spot ETH ETFs to launch in the U.S. market. The arguments for approval will likely outweigh the ones for denial over time. As a result, even if approval does not come by May 23, the chances of a greenlight over the next 12-18 months seem high.\n- David Lawant, Head of Research, FalconX\nQuestion: What do the U.S. spot bitcoin ETF approvals in the U.S. mean?\nThe approvals provide regulated access to bitcoin, and the inflows highlight the tremendous demand for investing in digital assets. ETFs are a simple way for advisors to include crypto in their client portfolios. It’s hard to ignore the record inflows and AUM.\nQuestion: Does this mean more approvals will be coming?\nWhile I can’t speak to what any regulator will approve, I think it’s important to look at other regions and how regulatory approvals of ETFs transpired. For example, the first spot bitcoin ETF was approved in Canada in early 2021. A few months later, ether ETFs gained approval and began trading. Now, there are over 11 ETFs, including a mixed cryptocurrency ETF and an ether-staking ETF. If the same pattern follows, an ether ETF approval can be near.\nEurope, Singapore, Australia and Dubai also have approved bitcoin ETFs available in their respective regions.\nThe other noteworthy item is the upcoming U.S. elections in November. The Republican party seems more eager for crypto legislation and adoption. A change in party incumbency may impact the broader digital asset landscape in the U.S.\nQuestion: What comes next?\nAfter the ETF approvals in Canada, the securities regulators created a registration framework and started defining structures for exchanges and crypto trading platforms requiring registration. Will the US follow suit now that ETFs are here?\nA number of companies have now submitted spot bitcoin ETF applications to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The UK announced that crypto-traded notes can be traded on the London Stock Exchange starting in May. It will be interesting to see how global approvals impact the U.S. and other regions.\n- Sarah Morton, chief strategy officer, MeetAmi Innovations Inc.\nSome bitcoin ETF issuers don’t expect the SEC to approve ether ETFs anytime soon.\nDeutsche Bank said of the more than 3,600 consumers surveyed recently, less than 1% see bitcoin as a passing fad, and 52% see bitcoin as an important asset class and payment system.\nPWC recently released their 2024 global report that provides a breakdown of crypto regulations.\n",

    "content": "Recent news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating companies associated with the Ethereum Foundation is consistent with the view that there is no more than a 50% chance of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in May, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Thursday.\nThe bank reiterated its view that approval of these products is unlikely next month, a position first expressed in January. The SEC must make final decisions on some of the ETF applications by May 23. The SEC approved spot bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January, stirring speculation in some quarters that versions for ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain, may follow suit.\n“If there is no spot ether ETF approval in May, then we assume there is going to be litigation against the SEC after May,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.\nJPMorgan said the most likely outcome is that the SEC will eventually lose this litigation, similar to what happened in the Grayscale and Ripple cases, and will eventually approve spot ether ETFs. But not in May.\nOne reason the SEC is likely to lose any litigation is because of the declining concentration in staking on Ethereum, raising the chance that ether will avoid being designated as a security, the report said.\nThe bank noted in a report last week that Lido’s share of staked ether has continued to fall, which should reduce concerns about concentration in the network.

Still, one observer does not favor placing bullish bets on volatility.\n\"From a qualitative perspective, I continue to believe paying a volatility premium for a highly predictable outcome (the BTC halving) isn\u0027t worth a volatility event premium,\" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a newsletter on Monday.\nTraders typically place bullish bets on volatility ahead of binary events, for which the market outcome is uncertain. Moreover, uncertainty opens the door to pre- and post-event price turbulence and has traders buying both call and put options or volatility futures to profit from any price swings.\nBut the impact of Bitcoin\u0027s reward halving on its native cryptocurrency and miners has been well documented.

Scheduled to occur around April 20 (the perfect meme, of course) the Bitcoin block issuance rate will drop from 6.25 coins per block, to 3.125.\nAlthough a small sample size, the past years in which Bitcoin had a halving event, the Jan to Dec performance averaged about 200%. This would imply an end-of-year price for BTC of about $91,500.\nThat said, from a derivatives trading perspective, the predictability and certainty around halving isn’t like the uncertainty of an SEC spot ETF decision and the subsequent ETF adoption. That means that traders aren’t likely to be surprised by a completely known event. Given this understanding, using Bitcoin derivatives as a contrast to Ethereum tells us a story around the potential opportunity for a post-halving rotation.\nLooking at the April 26 option expiration (top) versus the June 28 expiration (bottom), we can clearly see the dynamics being priced into both Bitcoin and Ethereum options. Firstly, for April 26, Bitcoin options on the call wing are priced at a substantial premium to the Ethereum call wing, while the Ethereum put wing is priced at a premium to the BTC put wing.\nLonger-dated options for June 28 are nearly identically overlaid, showing a tight relationship between BTC and ETH to be regular in the longer term.\nRead More: Did Strong Bitcoin ETF Demand Kill Halving\u0027s Potential Bullish Rally?\nWhat this tells me is that the current halving narrative is being priced into short-term BTC options, while at the same time, the lack of optimism around Ethereum due to a potential “securities” designation from the SEC and likely disapproval for a spot ETF in May are causing traders to bid for Ethereum puts.\nSomething else I’d like to point out is the differential in CME-led positioning between BTC and ETH.\nLooking at the top chart for BTC derivatives positioning we can see that CME futures (in green) really started in earnest in October around the enthusiasm for a spot ETF approval. Today, CME BTC open interest dwarfs any other exchange, including Binance.\nIf we look at Ethereum CME open interest, we see nearly no increases while Binance continues to exceed CME open interest by a large margin. This tells me that the US market has yet to begin building up positions in Ethereum; and should we move towards a spot ETF for Ethereum, whether in May or much later (after initial rejections), buyers haven’t crowded Ethereum yet.\nSo why should we even care about this opportunity to buy the laggard Ethereum?\nWhile the market is excited about the BTC halving slowing down the issuance rate for coins into circulation, (clearly displayed through 4/26 options) the ETH supply has not only already stopped growing, but since September 2022, is actively decreasing, due to EIP-1559 burns.\nEthereum has also just successfully completed the Dencun upgrade, as L2s and L3s begin to facilitate RWA, DeFi and NFT growth, along with the ability to build native “app-chains” for high throughput protocols that want to isolate activity within their own environment.\nNo one knows for sure what the future holds, and investing is peppered with risk. But a general axiom that I like is whether the fundamentals are already priced-in, or is the market under-invested in a potential opportunity?\nIn my mind, after halving, the BTC events will be behind us, and instead of merely “selling the news,” we can “rotate into the alts” in this case, specifically Ethereum.\n",

The pre-seed-stage startup is building an implementation and wallet for Bitcoin\u0027s layer-2 Lightning network on top of Urbit, an open-source software project that attempts to rewrite the entire internet computing stack from first principles.\nFlashback to 2022: Urbit Is Web3, Weird and Wonderful and I Don’t Care Who Made It\nAsked how much he expected the memento – scribbled at a time when bitcoin (BTC) traded around $2,400 – to fetch, Langalis said, \"I try not to think about it.\" However, he said that in recent weeks he received a private offer to buy the sign for five BTC, roughly $350,000 at recent prices. There is no reserve bid, or minimum price, he said.\nBidding for the sign will commence on April 18 and run for a week on Scarce City, but final bids will be entertained in person on April 24 at PubKey, a bitcoin-themed dive bar in New York (where a replica of the sign hangs on the wall). \"It\u0027s a way to celebrate with the community,\" Langalis said.\nRead more: How PubKey Revived Bitcoin Culture in New York City\nThe image of Langalis behind Yellen (who is now the U.S. Treasury Secretary and lukewarm at best about crypto) drew international attention to bitcoin. After pulling the stunt, he was escorted out of the House Financial Services hearing room for violating committee rules, he said. By that time, the image was being widely shared on social media, although he didn\u0027t know it yet.\n\"I was clueless,\" he said in a text message. \"Phone dead since I arrived [at the hearing] so early.\"\nUPDATE (April 11, 16:16 UTC): Adds link to third paragraph.\n",

What\u0027s clear is that blockchain tech enables all sorts of monetary strategies.\nIn this week\u0027s issue:\nSide-by-side charts showing impact of the proposal to adopt a new Ethereum issuance curve. (Ansgar Dietrichs and Caspar Schwarz-Schilling/Ethereum Magicians Forum)\nSOUNDER MONEY? Earlier this year, a pair of Ethereum Foundation (EF) researchers put forth a proposal to reduce the pace of new issuance of ether (ETH) tokens. It was part of a concerted plan to reduce incentives for new stakers – the investors who lock cryptocurrency into the blockchain as a way of helping to secure the network. The freshly minted ETH is a crucial component of the rewards these investors hope to receive, in the form of staking yields. As the researchers\u0027 thinking went, there\u0027s already enough stakers to provide effective security for the blockchain, and in fact any additional increases in the level of participation could enable the unwanted dominance of fast-growing third-party staking platforms like Lido. A side benefit of the proposed change would be to harden ether as a form of money, since the total supply of the cryptocurrency wouldn\u0027t grow as quickly – effectively tapering ether\u0027s inflation rate. The current issuance rate \"dilutes ETH holders beyond what is necessary for security,\" the researchers wrote. They estimated that the proposal would reduce ETH staking yields by nearly a third. Now, though, some members of the community are pushing back, as reported by CoinDesk\u0027s Margaux Nijkerk. There are questions over whether there\u0027s really a need to change the tokenomics of ether and, in the extreme, whether the Ethereum Foundation plays an outsize role in influencing code upgrades on the decentralized network. Viktor Bunin, a protocol specialist at Coinbase Cloud, wrote on the social-media platform X, “If it\u0027s not broke don\u0027t fix it.”\nMEME COIN GENERATOR GO BRRR… In last week\u0027s The Protocol, we made the point that blockchain teams have, generally speaking, succeeded in coopting the über-power of printing one\u0027s own money, long reserved for governments and banks. An integral element of the process are the various \"launchpads\" that teams use to spin up their new tokens. In an article this week, CoinDesk\u0027s Shaurya Malwa highlighted a project called Pump, which in the short period since going live last month has already earned $5 million in fees – partly due to the meme coin frenzy on the Solana blockchain. \"Selling shovels in a gold rush was one of the surest ways to make profits, and it’s no different today in the digital asset world,\" Malwa wrote. \"While there are likely tens of thousands of tokens that have been released on Pump since its March launch, only a few have reached market capitalizations of more than $10 million. The largest tokens so far are Shark Cat (SC), a cat wearing a shark cap, and Hobbes, named after the cat of popular Solana trader Ansem, with valuations of $100 million and $35 million, respectively,\" according to Malwa. Even so, Pump is on track to reap about $66 million of annual revenue, based on current usage and growth, DefiLlama data shows. Whether this token-generation business is legal, or approved by securities regulators, may depend on the circumstances, or the terms of use, or on the jurisdiction. But in the meantime investment bankers who used to lead elaborate offerings in exchange for Wall-Street-size fees (and Lambo-scale bonuses) are basically being replaced by apps.\nEU vs. MEV. The European Union markets regulator flagged maximum extractable value (MEV), whereby blockchain operators reorder user transactions to maximize their own profits, as a potential form of market abuse, a stance that is worrying some industry watchers who say the case is not clear-cut, CoinDesk\u0027s Sandali Handagama reports. “MEV by itself should not at all be considered as a market abuse and should not have a negative connotation,\" Anja Blaj, a policy expert at the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI), told Handagama in an interview over WhatsApp.\nBITCOIN HALVING FACTOID: On average, it has taken about 57 days after a Bitcoin halving for the network hashrate to recover to its pre-halving hashrate. (This is for the three halvings that have taken place since Satoshi Nakamoto launched the original blockchain in 2009. Bitcoin\u0027s fourth halving is estimated to arrive next week, coincidentally and yet characteristically on the very meme-y date of April 20.)

    "content": "Ethereum developers, fresh off the successful Dencun upgrade, which enabled a major change to make it cheaper to transact on layer-2 blockchains, are moving ahead in planning the blockchain\u0027s next improvements.\nThe contents of the next upgrade, \"Pectra,\" are nowhere near finalized, but developers have previously said their aim with the upgrade will be to ship it while simultaneously working on the chain\u0027s next upgrade.\n“The idea with Pectra is to try and find a bunch of small wins that we can get relatively quickly while we prototype the larger stuff,” Tim Beiko, protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk in an interview on The Protocol podcast\nAttendees at Thursday\u0027s Etheruem All Core Developers call – a bi-weekly meeting of the blockchain\u0027s primary developers – signaled that Pectra is likely to include Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3074, a proposed set of code changes for improving the user experience (UX) of Ethereum wallets. Specifically, the proposal will allow users to batch transactions and sign off on them all at once.\nAnother one of the main changes likely to occur in Pectra will be a lift to the staking limit for validators, from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH – a 64-fold increase. That proposal, known as EIP 7251, would allow large staking providers, like Coinbase or Lido, to consolidate their validators operating the Ethereum blockchain – while allowing them to avoid constantly creating new validators every time they have another 32 ETH to stake.\nAccording to Dune Analytics, over 1 million validators are currently operating the Ethereum network, which has led to concern over excessive latency. Developers have been looking for ways to slow the rate at which new validators enter the system – potentially bogging it down. EIP 2751 is pitched as a way to lighten the operational load for larger stakers, consolidate the number of validators on the blockchain, and allow staking providers to deploy less resources to staking and validating.\nThe name \"Pectra\" is a portmanteau of two simultaneous upgrades happening on the different layers of the blockchain. The execution layer, where protocol rules are enforced, will undergo the \"Prague\" upgrade, and the consensus layer, which ensures that blocks are validated, will go through the \"Electra\" upgrade.\nEthereum developers are known for Brangelina-ing their upgrades, like the previous one where the simultaneous Deneb and Cancun upgrades were referred to as “Dencun,” (and “Shapella” prior to that.) The Ethereum naming convention follows the different cities that Devcon took place in for the execution layer, and for the consensus layer, it follows an alphabetical order of the name of stars.\nOther EIPs for consideration include triggering validator withdrawals from smart contracts, adding a code change known as BLS precompile, and removing the deposit window. These are relatively small changes to the network for the developers to work on.\nThe upgrade following Pectra will include long-awaited \"verkle trees\" – a new type of data system designed to help Ethereum nodes store large amounts of data.\nBeiko said developers would aim to push Pectra out sometime at the end of 2024, maybe early 2025. “It\u0027s going to be a relatively small upgrade. The reason for that is that it allows us to work on two forks in parallel. We are working on Verkle trees and that transition,” Beiko said. “We are working on that but it\u0027s going to take more than a year. So in the meantime we have bandwidth to work on other small wins.”\nRead more: Ethereum Finalizes \u0027Dencun\u0027 Upgrade, in Landmark Move to Reduce Data Fees\n",

    "content": "Data provider Chainlink (LINK) unveiled Thursday its blockchain bridge application called \"Transporter,\" which allows users to move crypto assets and data across multiple networks.\nChainlink\u0027s bridge is available for both individual users and institutions and aims to allow \"a cost-efficient way to make high-value token transfers across blockchains with peace of mind,\" a Chainlink spokesperson explained in an interview on Telegram.\nThe first available blockchains for Transporter are Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and WEMIX, the press release said.\nThe release marks the entrance of the crypto world\u0027s key software platform that connects blockchain rails with external data – or oracle service – to the fast-growing sector of blockchain bridges. As the digital asset economy mushrooms, bridges serve a crucial role in connecting the ever-increasing number of individual blockchain rails, allowing the transfer of value and data between them. Existing bridges transferred some $12 billion worth of assets across chains through last month, DefiLlama data shows. However, bridges often are targets of exploits and hacks, carrying risks of losses for users.\nRead more: What Are Blockchain Bridges and How Do They Work?\n\"Having a secure way to move both value and data across chains is something the blockchain industry has needed for years,\" Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a statement. \"Transporter makes it easier to utilize the security benefits of Chainlink\u0027s CCIP for the transfer of large token value and critical messages across chains.\"\nTransporter was built on top of Chainlink\u0027s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), a piece of tech that has been a key component behind Chainlink\u0027s partnership with SWIFT, a closed network used by banks to make international money transfers.\nThe platform also offers global support and a real-time visual tracker to follow the status of transfer between chains. It charges the regular fee of using CCIP, which covers the cost of executing the transaction on the destination blockchain and the fees paid to CCIP service providers.\n\"I expect that Transporter will quickly establish itself as the standard for cross-chain enablement for high-value use cases,” said Nomatic, an investor at venture capital firm Fourth Revolution Capital, which was one of the early users of the bridge.\n",

    "type": "Sponsored Content",
    "summary": "Legendary key opinion leader Ben Armstrong drove his community\u0027s success after unveiling inscriptions on Phemex’s new social trading tool.\n",
    "content": "Phemex, a leading digital asset exchange, recognizes the pivotal role that platforms play as trusted partners in nurturing crypto communities. That’s why it has a detailed plan to ensure its traders are united and empowered.\nThe team behind Phemex has recently rolled out its new social trading feature, PhemexPulse, and it swiftly grabbed the crypto space’s attention. Intrinsically linked to the Web3 ecosystem, PhemexPulse offers a lucrative daily earning scheme that turns your routine social interactions into crypto rewards.\nHowever, the appeal of PhemexPulse extends beyond its rewards scheme, giving back to users for their engagement. The platform also features a unique inscription marketplace, where key opinion leaders (KOLs) can release exclusive inscriptions for their followers to mint, collect and trade. Ben Armstrong, a prominent figure in the crypto world, was the first to introduce his inscriptions on PhemexPulse, which led to an impressive surge in value of over 7,296% within the initial post-launch hours. This momentum was sustained over the next five days, culminating in a new all-time high (ATH) on March 20, representing a 56% increase from its initial peak. This remarkable growth translated into a cumulative 11,400% gain for the asset holders. In just one week\u0027s time, a user who started by minting 10 inscriptions, earning them 10 PT on day one, has experienced a staggering growth, with their holdings skyrocketing to 1000 PT.\n“Ben has long been a pivotal influencer within the crypto sphere, offering seasoned advice to crypto enthusiasts,” says Phemex COO Stella Chan. “His decision to release his inscriptions on PhemexPulse was met with enthusiasm, as the community eagerly seized the opportunity to acquire them.”\nBefore we get too far ahead of ourselves, though, let’s assume not everyone knows what inscriptions – and their related assets, ordinals – are. They’ve only been around for about a year.\nThey’re basically NFTs predicated on bitcoin. Ordinals are a system for ordering sats – that is, bitcoin fractions – in a way that renders them non-fungible. Inscriptions, then, are the contents of the ordinal NFT. They can be images, videos, texts or any other data.\nOn PhemexPulse, KOLs act as content creators and can also launch their distinct ordinals through an inscription marketplace, allowing the community’s aggregate demand to determine the value of each. Supporters vote with their wallets by acquiring these inscriptions to engage with and back their preferred influencers on PhemexPulse.\nRecently, Armstrong – who has 100,000 YouTube followers – introduced his exclusive inscriptions on PhemexPulse, limiting ownership to just 600 enthusiasts, with no more than 10 inscriptions per person. Scarcity tends to drive up prices, so the market met this release with an immediate surge.\n“Ben’s inscriptions are a testament to the explosive potential in this space,” according to Chan. “At Phemex, we\u0027re not just strengthening community ties by facilitating deeper connections with leading crypto figures, but also providing a gateway to a vibrant market.”\nKOLs including Armstrong can nest pretty much any kind of data they want in these NFTs. Some might be collectible in their own right with no intrinsic value beyond the influencer’s fandom – but they might still be fun and lucrative to acquire. Others, though, could conceivably contain investment tips, instructions to access insider-only coin drops or other opportunities to earn. And there’s a potential early-adopter benefit to acquiring inscriptions before anyone else has even heard of them.\nThe value of inscriptions on PhemexPulse are measured in PT, Phemex’s native coin.\nWhile Armstrong deserves credit for paving the way, the inscription market has a lot of growth potential for other influencers looking to get in on the ground floor.\nKOLs can monetize their influence on PhemexPulse simply by creating their own Web3 group, funded by Phemex. By attracting followers with top-notch content and trading tips, these influencers and their followers can unlock daily PT rewards based on their accumulated points.\nIndeed, the landscape is crowded with various social networking platforms that users frequent, particularly during a bull market. However, PhemexPulse distinguishes itself by not only rewarding users for their consistent online engagement, but also by fostering a closer relationship between KOLs and their followers within a conversational environment. It has already cultivated a dynamic marketplace where unique creations can be minted, held and valued. Phemex is now inviting more content creators to join PhemexPulse and establish their own groups, capitalizing on the myriad opportunities that both they and the market offer.\nFor more information, to join a PhemexPulse group or to create your own using, visit its website.\n",

    "title": "BlockFi’s Rise and Fall: A Timeline",
    "type": "Learn",
    "summary": "BlockFi, a crypto lending company, was founded in October 2017 and filed for bankruptcy just over five years later in the wake of FTX\u0027s collapse.\n",
    "content": "Crypto lender BlockFi is kaput. The platform, which offered high yields on crypto deposits, has filed for bankruptcy protection. It’s the latest company to fall after the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Indeed, bankruptcy filings show that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. But how did it all go so wrong? CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture.\nZac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company’s chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral.\nVenture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer.\nFlush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it \"doesn’t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.” As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn’t seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company.\nThe firm’s next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts.\nIn December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood’s business model. “Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,” BlockFi’s CEO said.\nPeter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led BlockFi’s $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping “BlockFi expand into Singapore” and the Asia-Pacific region.\nBlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to “crypto payment rails” such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren\u0027t already cryptocurrency owners.” The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform.\nAll was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee’s phone with a “SIM swap” that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee’s phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi’s retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi’s customers.\nIn August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors.\nIn October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk\u0027s parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020.\nBlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin.\nEarly in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale’s product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\nAll was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin’s soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong?\nNew Jersey’s Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state’s financial regulator claimed BlockFi’s interest accounts amounted to sales of an “unregistered security” and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers.\nThe CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that – and it didn’t end well for BlockFi (we’ll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card.\nIn February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. “Today’s settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.\nIn June, BlockFi’s valuation sank to $1 billion in a “down round” – a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund\u0027s collateral before its bankruptcy. In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi’s main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection.\nIn dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren’t met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S.\nAt the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11.\nThat was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX’s credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid “the lack of clarity” about FTX. On Nov. 11, California’s financial regulator revoked BlockFi’s lending license.\nBlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried\u0027s Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan.\nIn the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX. All the while, one question looms: Will customers get anything back?\nRead More: Latest BlockFi Stories\n",

    "content": "Uplink, a company attempting to democratize internet access, announced a $10 million funding round led by Framework Ventures.\nThe firm is a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), a sector that data provider Messari estimates could have a market value of $3.5 trillion by 2028. DePIN projects connect blockchain technology with physical systems and often offer tokens to incentivize people to crowdsource the infrastructure.\nUplink provides decentralized network connectivity with the aim of creating better distributed and user-operated infrastructure. According to the company, the idea is to reduce reliance on traditional centralized telecommunication providers.\nUsers and enterprises will be able to earn tokens as a reward by either contributing to the network or using it. They can integrate their existing infrastructure into the Uplink network or install compatible hardware for their community/business. The company plans to launch a token later this year.\n“By creating financial incentives that encourage people to increase DePin-powered internet access, more users will then be able to access connectivity wherever Uplink offers coverage and flag areas of need where it does not,” the company said in the press release.\nAccording to Framework Ventures, Most DePIN projects, including Helium, have historically taken a retail-focused approach to initial distribution of the network and hardware. Helium is arguably one of the largest and first DePIN projects, with a market capitalization of almost $1 billion.\n\"Uplink is instead prioritizing large enterprise partnerships for initial distribution. We think in DePIN’s nascent stage, our best bet for initial adoption will come from conglomerates that can actively help push fleet deployment,\" said Framework Ventures.\nFounded in 2016, Uplink collaborated with Ericsson, Deutsche Telekom, and E.ON, according to the statement.\n",

    "title": "Why William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s Price",
    "type": "Learn",
    "summary": "Recently released emails from former SEC director William Hinman have rallied the XRP troops, but the documents are not a smoking gun.\n",
    "content": "On June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC\u0027s lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case.\nHere’s why:\nVery broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly.\nRipple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators.\nEarly analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails’ release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front.\nAhead of the documents’ release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn’t a security if it is “sufficiently decentralized.” That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is “sufficiently decentralized” and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman.\nCritics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token – and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security.\nRipple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called “Ripple” even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders “gifted” 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as “Ripple.”\nRead More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency?\nTo critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of “decentralization theater.” And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures.\nIn any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple\u0027s side of the case, XRP\u0027s price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.\nSee Also: Ripple Does Not Care Whether XRP Is “Sufficiently Decentralized”\n",

A new version is bringing the hype back.\nFriend.Tech, a blockchain-based social application that allows crypto personalities on X to issue shares for access to closed group chats, has seen a resurgence in activity and value locked.\nRecent developments, including a possible FRIEND token and expansion beyond X, have renewed interest in the platform.\nMore than $7 million has flowed into the platform in anticipation of the developments.\n",
    "content": "Money is flowing back into social application Friend.Tech as a new version teases an eventual airdrop, bringing users back to what was among the biggest revenue-generating platforms during the bear market.\nOver $7 million flowed to Friend.Tech last week after months of outflows, boosting the value locked to nearly $40 million, data shows. Weekly fees have crossed $1.3 million for the first time since November, making the platform over $600,000 in revenue.\nBuilt on Base, a layer-2 network, Friend.Tech lets crypto personalities on X issue “shares” for access to a closed group chat. For users, the allure of these chats is that their owners could offer trading insights, token picks or access to seed-funding deals – which raises the value of the shares.\nThe bump in activity precedes the coming of version 2 of the application, which developers said will be released after April 20. A key element of the update is expanding the platform beyond X to attract newer users.\nOver the weekend, developers also teased a FRIEND token. Expectations among users are that these could be distributed based on how many points – a reward for Friend.Tech usage – they accumulate before the token release.\nFriend.tech was earning in excess of $1 million per day in fees at its August peak after going viral on X and gaining more than 100,000 unique users, a significant number for crypto application standards. Shares of some crypto X personalities, such as @Cobie and @HsakaTrades, jumped to as much as three ether, or nearly $5,000, at the time.\nActivity fell off in the months following as the initial allure wore off. Security risks later marred the platform alongside opportunities elsewhere in the sector, leading to months of outflows since November.\n",

    "content": "CoinDesk’s Consensus has seen plenty of heated blockchain battles over its ten year history. But 2024’s matchup in the Karate Combat Pit takes the dueling to a new level.\nCrypto influencers Nic Carter and David Hoffman are set to go toe-to-toe on May 30 during this year’s conference in Austin, Texas. “Influencer Fight Club 2” is the part of the increasingly popular Karate Combat series, essentially a no-holds-barred version of UFC without the (time-wasting) on-mat grappling. Carter, co-founder of data analytics leader Coin Metrics and VC fund Castle Island Ventures, will represent Bitcoin, while Hoffman, the founder of media platform Bankless, will fly the colors for Ethereum. The bout is two rounds of two minutes each, with a third round scheduled if a tiebreaker is needed.\nAlso on the card is Billy McFarland, the infamous Fyre Festival entrepreneur, who squares off against Alex, better known by his handle @shillin_villain.\n“I’m very confident,” said Carter, via X DMs. “I’ve never trained in martial arts before this and I don’t think David has either. But we are both very fitness focused – which makes us a good matchup.” Both fighters have hired trainers to work on basic fighting skills and they’re preparing hard around other day-to-day commitments.\nThe friends have a side bet where they’ll donate $10,000 to the winner’s chosen open-source development group. Carter’s choice is the Bitcoin Core, which maintains the Bitcoin network. Hoffman’s is Protocol Guild, the equivalent organization in the Ethereum community.\nWhen the news leaked on X last week, several commenters made fun of the fighters’ physiques and mocked their fighting skills. But the two are undeterred. “At the end of the day, it’s me and David that are taking the risk and getting in the ring and all they can do is watch,” Carter said. “If they want to fight they can try and get in the undercard, they are welcome to reach out to Karate Combat. But David and I aren’t claiming to be amazing fighters. The objective is to entertain and take on a new challenge, not to begin decorated fight careers.” “It’s been funny to hear all the haters who want to fight us,” adds Hoffman. “I have no interest in fighting anyone but Nic Carter.” This is the 46th Karate Combat event and the second under the banner “Influencer Fight Club (IFC).” The first, featuring Ben “BitBoy” Armstrong and meme coin creator “More Light,” in Mexico City in February, drew hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. BitBoy beat the more-fancied More Light in a match full of aggression and flanging fists and arms.\nKarate Combat founder ONLYLARPING said he wants the format to “be the first official sport of Web3.” “It makes sense to partner with the biggest and best conferences in the world and the most entertaining influencers and founders.”\nResearch by Karate Combat found that a large percentage of its audience don’t enjoy sports unless there is a side-bet element to it. The platform has a no-loss gaming feature, where Karate token-holders plump for a winner and are given a small share of the prize money if they pick the right horse. If they pick the loser, they don’t give up anything.\nThe Karate Combat series at Consensus features six influencer fights and 10 more conventional bouts involving professional fighters. The action begins May 30 at 7 pm local time. Weigh-ins take place May 29 at 5 pm on the Town Square stage.\n",

    "type": "Markets",
    "summary": "The halving, due on April 20, will reduce the per-block bitcoin emission to 3.12 BTC from 6.25 BTC, slowing the pace of supply expansion by 50%.\nBitcoin options show expectations for pre-halving price weakness and a bullish bias following the pivotal quadrennial event.\nThe long-term outlook depends more on macro factors than halving, analysts said.\nOptions market shows expectations for a price rally into six figures by December.\n",
    "content": "The bitcoin (BTC) options market, historically a reliable indicator of sentiment, is showing investors expect weakness in the run-up to the mining-reward halving due April 20 followed by a rally after the event, which reduces the pace of new bitcoin creation by cutting the per-block coin emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.\nThe world\u0027s largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading about $71,000. Put options at strike prices of $61,000 and $60,000 listed on derivatives exchange Deribit have the highest build-up, respectively, of open interest among options expiring a week before and a day before halving, according to data tracked by Amberdata.\nPut options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at the specified price at a later date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, looking to profit from or hedge against a price slide. Open interest refers to the number of active or open contracts at a given time.\nThe chart shows open interest distribution in options expiring on April 19, a day before halving is expected. At press time, open interest in the $60,000 put was 1,000 contracts or $70.90 million, the highest in the expiry. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC.\nThe temporary pre-halving nervousness is consistent with analysts\u0027 view that prices may wobble around the halving time.\nMeanwhile, open interest in options expiring on April 26 – about a week after the halving – was more evenly distributed, with calls or bullish bets at $70,000 and $80,000 more popular than others. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.\n\"Right ahead of the halving, you have notable open interest in the $60,000 put expiring a day before the event, whereas month-end is a bit more spread out,\" Simranjeet Singh, a trader at the crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk. \"I guess some traders may want to fade the move in the short term, similar to the ETF event, until we reach a nice consolidation level for another leg higher.\"\nSingh said the next leg higher partly depends on the U.S. interest-rate outlook and political developments.\nBitcoin saw a brief drop to $67,600 on Wednesday after hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data saw traders push back the timing of the first Fed rate cut to November from June. The losses were short-lived, with prices rebounding early Thursday as the rate cut remains on the table, though delayed.\n\"The newly found \u0027Fed put\u0027 remains in place though, with the Fed focused on both risks to inflation and employment, rather than on inflation alone,\" trader and analyst Alex Kruger said on X. The \"Fed put\" is a notion that the central bank will come to the rescue if the economy or markets falter.\nTrader Christopher Newhouse said bitcoin options expiring after May will be affected more by the macroeconomic environment and organic demand than the halving.\nThe large concentration of open interest in the $100,000 December expiry and the $200,000 March 2025 expiry calls shows expectations that macro factors would continue to act as a tailwind.\nAs of writing, the December expiry call at $100,000 had a notional open interest of $226 million, while the open interest in the March expiry call at $200,000 was $70.7 million.\n",

    "type": "Learn",
    "summary": "More people are calling for crypto companies and those behind products such as stablecoins to prove they have enough funds to pay their customers.\n",
    "content": "Regular banks do not actually hold all of your money. They lend out most of your deposits in an attempt to eke out returns from financial markets. This works, for the most part, because the bank insures deposits with the federal government and because the bank widely diversifies its exposure to risk to ensure that it won’t be caught short in the event of a financial crash.\nThis system occasionally fails in traditional finance (see: Lehman) but fails frequently in crypto. The government does not insure deposits to crypto platforms and the platforms often do not manage risk particularly well (see: FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network), making high-risk bets that end in catastrophe.\nRead More: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?\nAfter so many platforms squandered customer funds, crypto traders are thinking twice about depositing funds to crypto exchanges and lending institutions that “rehypothecate” uninsured deposits – which means they repurpose customer money and lend the funds out in the markets. A safer bet looks like trading on platforms that “fully back” their reserves. But what does this really mean, and should such claims be taken with a pinch of salt?\nWhen a financial product, such as a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to “fully back” its reserves, it means that it has stored enough money behind a product, like a stablecoin or a customer’s trading account, to support its worth.\nSo, a crypto exchange that “fully backs” its reserves should always be able to pay out customer withdrawals, no matter the state of the market. One such example is Coinbase, which does not lend out its customers’ funds without their express permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to prevent a bank run.\nA stablecoin that “fully backs” its reserves is always able to fulfill conversions to the original asset, no matter what. One example is wBTC, or wrapped bitcoin, which holds real bitcoin (BTC) in a cold wallet, then issues an equal amount of an Ethereum-based version of the coin that trades as an ERC-20 token.\nFully backed, however, does not necessarily mean that assets are held one to one. That claim refers to the idea that if you, say, give me a dollar, I’ll hold that dollar as a dollar and won’t turn it into something else. Lots of stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like U.S.-dollar stablecoin USDC, are not backed one to one.\nThis is because the companies that issue USDC hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in “cash and cash equivalents.” Cash equivalents refer to U.S. Treasury bonds, which is debt issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. These bonds, which pay small returns to holders over time, are close enough to the worth of actual U.S. dollars that the market accepts bonds being essentially worth the same.\nBut “fully backed” does not always mean that the backing can withstand financial shocks. U.S. dollar stablecoin tether (USDT) also claims that its reserves are fully backed, but this backing is secured by “other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether [the issuing company] to third parties.” So, USDT may be fully backed, but it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies.\nUntil October 2022, USDT was also backed by commercial paper – short-term commercial debt to other companies – and moved those funds to U.S. Treasurys. The concern about the commercial paper was that nobody knew which companies Tether was using to back USDT, so it was impossible to determine the worth of that backing. What’s more, its “fully backed” claim has historically turned out not to be true after it emerged in 2019 that USDT was, at one point, only 74% backed. As wrote the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u0027s Dawn D. Stump, the claim that it was backed to the U.S. dollar was “not 100% true, 100% of the time.”\nRead more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its Value\nSome stablecoins do not fully back their reserves, which has led to catastrophic results in some cases. The popular algorithmic stablecoin UST, for instance, crashed in spectacular fashion, wiping billions from the market.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, meaning it has more than enough crypto on hand to back its coin. DAI has survived several market crashes.\n\n",

    "content": "At CoinDesk, we’re not just chronicling the business model transformation that digital assets and the blockchain have made possible – we’re actively participating in it.\nAt Consensus 2021, a virtual event, we beta-tested DESK, an experiment in using tokenized rewards to incentivize engagement and community-building, garnering positive feedback from our audience. At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019.\nIn December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com.\nRead More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader Experience\nBelow is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information.\nDESK is CoinDesk’s social token.\nDESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content.\nDESK’s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together.\nAs of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include:\nAt Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as:\nDESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum.\nPolygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction.\nYou’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners.\nRead more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your Wallet\nYes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account.\nIn the Web2 era, content creators – be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers – have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines).\nWe’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms.\nWe believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal.\nWe hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event.\nSocial tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants.\nInitially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward.\nSimply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience.\nNo. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone’s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity.\nIt is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading.\nBy providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We\u0027ve seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization.\nNo. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users.\nNo. See above.\nNo. We\u0027re not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement.\nListing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use.\nIt’s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests.\nSo, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether.\nPart of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground.\nNo. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless.\nCoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon.\nBecause DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK\u0027s beta testers.\nPiranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept.\nAt Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk’s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike.\nCoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others.\nAs mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used.\nNavigate to the DESK dashboard. Select \"Create or Connect Wallet\" and approve the transaction in your wallet.\nDepends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com. We will not use this data for anything other than authenticating users when they sign on or distributing DESK rewards, we will never sell it, and we will protect user information assiduously. (See our privacy policy.) DESK transactions will appear on DESK\u0027s page on the Polyscan block explorer, but only the wallet addresses will be displayed.\nDESK has no inherent monetary value, but, whether or not you live in a jurisdiction where utility tokens are deemed taxable, you should consult a tax professional if you have concerns.\nWe’ll keep a record of airdrops, product developments and other updates critical to DESK’s roadmap and tokenomics in our DESK product blog.\nYou can also keep abreast of DESK updates in our Discord server.\nThe latest release is only the beginning in developing our Web3 model for DESK on coindesk.com. We\u0027ll be working on improving our wallet functionality, currently in beta, and looking forward to seeing what data and reader feedback reveal as to how to continue improving the experience\n",

Some market observers say this could lead to a “sell-side” crisis in the medium term should such flows continue.\n“Bears can’t win this game until spot bitcoin ETF inflow stops,” said CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju in an X post. “Last week, spot ETFs saw netflows of +30K BTC. Known entities like exchanges and miners hold around 3M BTC, including 1.5M BTC by U.S. entities.”\n“At this rate, we’ll see a sell-side liquidity crisis within 6 months,” Ki added.\nMeanwhile, Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast on Tuesday that the bitcoin options market flashed a bullish sign for traders but expressed caution ahead.\n“The volatility market continues to express bullishness in BTC as volatility remains very elevated for the calls, particularly in the backend of the curve,” QCP said. “We are wary of another washout with funding rates reaching elevated levels again, although we still expect dips to be bought up very quickly,” the firm added.\nVolatility is a dynamic figure that changes based on activity in the options marketplace. Funding rates are paid by leveraged traders to those on the opposite side of that trade, and the bias toward long or shorts can indicate a bullish or bearish view of the market.\n",

    "summary": "There are a few things that make Jack Dorsey’s vision for Web5 distinct, including not wanting to completely replace Web2 but work with it.\n",
    "content": "The world is still getting its collective head around Web3 – a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls \"Web5\"?\nIt turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey’s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises “an extra decentralized web platform.”\nTo land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 \u003d 5.\nWeb5’s core idea is to “put you in control of your data and identity” – a core tenet of Web3’s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet’s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS.\nDorsey’s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data “captive in app silos,” Web5 pushes for “a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.”\nThere are three pillars at Web5’s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017.\nSo, what’s new here – apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey’s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any “special utility tokens or subjective consensus” that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service.\nIn doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin’s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5’s nascent community already balked at TBD’s attempt to trademark the term Web5.\nThe other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5’s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user’s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform.\nTBD’s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to “help her visualize her itinerary.” Again, the idea is to tie data that’s usually locked inside centralized services – something TBD calls “a massive, unworkable mess” – to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user’s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes.\nWill it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that’s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS).\nOne of the key things that distinguish TBD’s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it’s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5’s announcement: “Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It’s like a high school student saying ‘yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it’s meant to be.’ It’s naive.”\n",

    "summary": "The \"restaking\" protocol with $15 billion in deposits won\u0027t pay rewards to depositors and is missing its mission-critical \"slashing\" feature.\n",
    "content": "The blockchain project EigenLayer didn\u0027t go live on Ethereum\u0027s mainnet until Tuesday, but it had already become one of the network\u0027s biggest-ever protocols, with $12 billion worth of user deposits – a hot ticket partly because of its highly touted innovation of \"restaking,\" a new technology that could usher in dramatic changes in the way crypto protocols bootstrap their security.\nA closer inspection reveals that EigenLayer has not yet activated most of the core features that make the project notable – including its reward system and its mission-critical \"slashing\" mechanism.\nIn the fast-moving, big-money world of crypto, EigenLayer has attracted a level of investor, developer and media interest that\u0027s rare: On top of its $15 billion worth of deposits at press time, Eigen Labs, the project\u0027s developer, raised a staggering $100 million from venture giant Andreessen Horowitz last year.\nThere\u0027s also a cottage industry of startups – called \"actively validated services\" (AVSs) – that are waiting to plug into EigenLayer\u0027s security apparatus, as well as \"liquid restaking\" startups aiming to piggyback off of EigenLayer\u0027s success, already netting billions of dollars in their own deposits.\nEigenDA, a data-availability protocol built by Eigen Labs, was the first AVS to launch on EigenLayer – released on Tuesday in tandem with the rest of the EigenLayer protocol. As other AVS networks wait in the wings – for now, they\u0027re only allowed to \"register\" – EigenDA is supposed to be a proof-of-concept for what EigenLayer will eventually enable for other services: A way for networks to base their own security on Ethereum\u0027s.\nIn EigenLayer\u0027s current, arguably still larval state, however, EigenDA relies on a strikingly conventional security model. The protocol is controlled by a globally distributed set of operators, but they won\u0027t be financially punished if they act dishonestly – a core component of EigenLayer\u0027s purported security model. The protocol also won\u0027t pay out rewards to depositors, which is supposed to be the main incentive for restaking.\nSreeram Kannan, EigenLayer\u0027s founder and chief architect, acknowledged in an interview last week that the launch would move forward without some crucial functionality, instead proceeding under a \"phased\" rollout under an unspecified timeline.\n\"We are allowing the EigenLayer marketplace to develop and stabilize before introducing in-protocol payments and slashing to mainnet later this year,\" EigenLayer said on Tuesday in its launch thread.\nThe use of so-called training wheels is not out of the norm in crypto – particularly given the experimental culture of the industry: When a startup is trusted with billions of dollars in user deposits, Silicon Valley\u0027s \"move fast and break things\" approach doesn\u0027t really cut it.\n\"There are a lot of other projects that just take shortcuts and kind of balloon and are much, much higher risk than this,\" said Mike Silagadze, CEO of Ether.fi, a liquid restaking service that has deposited $3.8 billion worth of its users\u0027 funds into EigenLayer. \"I think relative to other crypto projects, this has actually been reasonably measured.\"\nBut as the third-largest decentralized finance protocol in terms of total value locked (TVL) – and competitors beginning to encroach on its turf – expectations for EigenLayer couldn\u0027t be higher.\nEigenLayer centers around \"restaking\" – a way of repurposing the Ethereum blockchain\u0027s security to cover additional protocols, these AVSs. Technically how it works is that investors can take the ether (ETH) they\u0027ve staked on the main Ethereum chain, and then reapply (or \"restake\") it to secure the AVSs; they could be blockchain bridges, crypto exchanges or data storage facilities.\nThe benefit for EigenLayer investors – called \"restakers\" – is that they get an extra rate of return on top of the interest they already receive for staking ETH. The AVSs get the advantage of \"pooled security.\"\nKannan gives the example of 100 blockchain protocols that are each secured by $1 billion worth of stake.\nImagine that \"instead of each of the protocols having $1 billion separately staked, there was $100 billion commonly staked across 100 protocols,\" said Kannan. \"To attack any one protocol, now you need $100 billion rather than needing $1 billion.\"\nThat\u0027s the idea, at least. The actual meat of the EigenLayer security system remains more theory at this point than reality, as do the pieces of EigenLayer\u0027s design that are supposed to pay out interest to depositors.\nTake, for example, the \"slashing\" feature that sits at the center of EigenLayer\u0027s security system. Slashing is integral to EigenLayer: It ensures that networks built on top of the protocol can penalize operators if they act dishonestly – by revoking all or a portion of their restaked deposits.\nBut slashing wasn\u0027t included in EigenLayer\u0027s launch this week, and in an interview, Kannan couldn\u0027t give a firm timeline on when it would be ready – beyond that it would be sometime later this year.\nThere also remain big questions about how the whole thing will actually work – including how, and in what proportion, slashed tokens will be burned and distributed once they\u0027ve been revoked. For AVSs to build on EigenLayer, such questions eventually need to be answered.\n\"Even though the full slashing is not live, we are going to run this system in beta and make sure that people are able to use it, and maybe have redundant backups and other stuff,\" said Kannan.\nAnother yet-to-be-defined element of EigenLayer\u0027s programming is its \"attributable security\" system – a fallback mechanism that Kannan plans to use to protect against black swan events that threaten to wipe out the protocol\u0027s security apparatus. The feature exists to address the potential for contagion risk – the idea that a slashing event triggered by one AVS could hurt the security of every other AVS.\nAttributable security works a lot like insurance (crypto founders mint new terms as quickly as they do new tokens), and in principle, a new actuarial market will spring up with pricing for each of the AVSs, ostensibly linked to their perceived risk.\n\"A service that\u0027s built on Eigenlayer can come in and say, \u0027Out of this $100 billion that is totally staked, I want a particular attribution of $3 billion,\u0027\" explained Kannan. \"Now, it\u0027s EigenLayer as a protocol\u0027s job to make sure that even if every other AVS is simultaneously depleted, I will be able to redistribute the amount of $3 billion to this AVS.\"\nBut asked to define how EigenLayer\u0027s attributable security market will actually price things in practice, Kannan said that his team \"has not published\" anything on it yet.\nThen there\u0027s EigenLayer\u0027s fee system – the source of revenue it will use to reward interest to depositors, which is supposed to be the main incentive for restaking.\nKannan said in an interview with CoinDesk that the fee system is at the top of his team\u0027s priority list and should be easy to implement, but its absence means that users won\u0027t be able to earn interest for restaking with AVSs.\nIn the absence of this core feature, the billions of dollars deposited into EigenLayer thus far have come as a result of the platform\u0027s point system: EigenLayer prints out loyalty points that investors hope will eventually be convertible into real crypto tokens.\nUntil EigenLayer launched this week, many crypto traders and users were simply pursuing these points – Earning them by depositing assets into EigenLayer and liquid restaking protocols like Ether.Fi, and, in some cases, buying the points outright and trading them on 40x leverage via third-party crypto protocols aimed at risk-seekers.\n\"In hindsight, I would probably say, man, we should have really toned down the point stuff because that just went really crazy,\" said Ether.Fi\u0027s Silgadze. \"Crypto is insane, so people took it way too far.\"\nRead more: As Crypto \u0027Points\u0027 Farming Grows, So Does Risk of Vague Promises\nWithout slashing, fees and attributable security, EigenDA, currently the only AVS, is a far cry from what is ultimately envisioned for EigenLayer.\nIn the near term, EigenDA will be operated by a community of validators, but those validators won\u0027t be at risk of slashing – this means they won\u0027t be financially incentivized to act honestly (which is, well… the whole point of EigenLayer\u0027s \"pooled security\").\nKannan says most of EigenLayer\u0027s main features will arrive by the end of this year, but some find it difficult to take those estimates at face value.\n“In some cases, there\u0027s just engineering problems, where you kind of bat your head against it, and eventually you\u0027re gonna figure it out,\" said Silgadze. \"And then there\u0027s research problems [...] there\u0027s literally no solution known.\"\nWhen it comes to those research problems, \"it\u0027s hard to respect timelines,\" said Silgadze, \"because these are unsolved problems that you\u0027re trying to sort out.\"\nThe lack of clarity around the state of EigenLayer\u0027s technical stack has led to mounting frustration among some EigenLayer developers who requested anonymity in order to discuss the topic candidly – along with confusion for users around where EigenLayer currently sits on its ambitious roadmap.\nThere are also concerns that EigenLayer\u0027s design is tantamount to \"rehypothecation\" – an oft-criticized practice from traditional finance where collateral is repackaged for higher potential returns, but also a higher risk of losses. (Kannan vehemently rebuts this argument, stating that, among other things, EigenLayer is different from conventional rehypothecation because it grants users complete control over their assets.)\n\"I think we need to get better at communicating changes and our roadmap to the broader EigenLayer ecosystem,\" said Kannan. \"We did not expect to be at this scale where there\u0027s so many projects that are dependent and are downstream of our codebase.\"\nCalvin Liu, Eigen Labs\u0027 chief strategy officer, says he welcomes the scrutiny.\n\"When something has a ton of hype, that’s when you should examine most closely and be most skeptical. I appreciate that and take that view to other projects all the time,\" Liu said in a message on Telegram. \"I am confident that in time we’ll stand up to that view. And I welcome the prodding - it only makes us better in the long run.\"\n",

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\nDecentralized crypto exchange Uniswap received a notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it intends to pursue an enforcement action, the company said Wednesday. Uniswap\u0027s native token, UNI, dropped 9.5% immediately after the news and has lost 18% over the past 24 hours. Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams announced receipt of the so-called Wells notice on X, saying he wasn’t surprised, “just annoyed, disappointed, and ready to fight.” Wells notices are preliminary warnings that inform respondents of the charges the regulator is considering bringing against them. They usually lead to enforcement actions. In a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, COO Mary-Catherine Lader and Chief Legal Officer Marvin Ammori told reporters that the Wells notice was focused on Uniswap acting as an unregistered securities broker and unregistered securities exchange. It remains unclear whether the UNI token was implicated as a potential security in the SEC’s notice.\nBitcoin’s (BTC) much anticipated halving event later this month could see a flurry of bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting upside on both technical and meme-coin projects. Halving reduces the rate at which new coins are created and lowers the available new supply. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. This event has historically preceded a bull market for the token. Crypto traders say participants seek a “reason to buy” as money narratives continuously shift in the current bullish environment and they may turn their focus on the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming weeks.\nHeightened anticipation for spot-based bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and the eventual inflows supercharged bitcoin\u0027s run-up to all-time highs, and now Hong Kong\u0027s regulators are reportedly inching closer to approving similar funds, news that thus far has been mostly unnoticed in crypto circles.

    "content": "Edgar Pavlovsky, the CEO of the company building crypto borrow-and-lend platform MarginFi resigned Wednesday as internal fissures at the major Solana DeFi project erupted into public view.\n“I don\u0027t agree with the way things have been done internally or externally,” Pavlovsky said in a resignation notice on X, formerly Twitter. MarginFi\u0027s own account called the departure of its co-founder “a function of internal operational disagreements and of his own personal reasons.\"\nThe abrupt exit capped a fiery day for Solana\u0027s second-largest lending platform that saw allegations fly and tempers flare. Amidst the chaos, users pulled nearly $100 million from the platform, according to analytics site DeFiLlama – MarginFi\u0027s largest-ever day of withdrawals.\n\"All products remain fully operational and are unaffected (and can not be affected) by this departure. The point of DeFi is that core contributors can walk away, and the protocol marches on,\" MarginFi said in a tweet.\nMarginFi\u0027s meltdown comes after weeks of withdrawal function issues at the borrow-and-lend platform and months after it launched a points program that preceded a wave of growth-fueling incentivization loyalty schemes across Solana DeFi.\nBut while other protocols reward their points-earning users with a token, MarginFi hasn\u0027t, much to the anger of some of its users.\nIn mid-March, a problem in MarginFi\u0027s price data sourcing \"oracle\" infrastructure had caused some users\u0027 withdrawal requests to fail to start when Solana\u0027s network congestion was still rising.\n\"The stale Oracle issues currently impact withdrawals, not deposits, I think, so it\u0027s leading to some accusations from users who feel that MarginFi is just taking their deposits and not letting them withdraw,\" the builder of popular liquid staking service SolBlaze told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.\nSolBlaze lodged its own accusations against MarginFi on Wednesday. The service rewards holders of its bSOL and BLZE tokens with more tokens, which are called emissions. Depositors of SolBlaze tokens on MarginFi also get these reward payouts, but via mrgn and MarginFi.\nHowever, for at least eight days those payments through MarginFi had not been getting to bSOL and BLZE token owners, according to SolBlaze. This was due to a quirk in the way MarginFi handled earmarked tokens, but it was left unmonitored and with no communication to SolBlaze, which has since severed its business relationship with MarginFi.\n\"The main problem was our lack of organizational execution,\" Pavlovsky told CoinDesk in a Telegram message sent hours before he announced his resignation.\nPavlovsky\u0027s exit throws MarginFi\u0027s leadership into uncertainty. An employee of the New York City-centric project referred CoinDesk to MarginFi\u0027s statement.\n\"We want to assure the community that the core contributors, the company, and our investors are actively engaged to ensure a smooth transition,\" the post read without saying who was taking over.\nKyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, an investor in MarginFi, posted on X that he remains committed to the protocol and is not withdrawing anything.\nOne candidate may be MacBrennan Peet, another co-founder of MarginFi with a history of embracing online controversy, including releasing a video of himself shirtless and crowing \"wen token\" in December 2023.\n\"Moving forward, I\u0027ll be a more authentic person online,\" he said in a tweet. Peet called his previous social media stunts and \"very intentionally controversial\" persona a \"growth-hacking\" strategy that \"largely worked\" to boost MarginFi\u0027s user base.\nGrowth hack or not, that persona also succeeded in making MarginFi its enemies in Solana DeFi. One of them was Solend, once the leading protocol for borrow-and-lend on Solana.\nMoving to capitalize on its foe\u0027s weaknesses, Solend announced it would airdrop a token to MarginFi users who move their money to Solend and keep it there. At press time, the push hadn\u0027t yet led to a noticeable uptick in deposits on Solend, according to DeFillama.\nOn a day where MarginFi lost $80 million to withdrawals, the major borrow-and-lend platform Kamino saw $51 million in deposits, its third largest day of inflows ever.\nFrom Mac\u0027s \"wen token\" shirtless meme video to the daily chants of \"wen token\" in MarginFi\u0027s Telegram channel, the protocol faces intense pressure to drop a new crypto asset to its user base.\n\"People feel like they\u0027ve been farmed for TVL without getting the airdrop that they would have expected from a points program,\" SolBlaze said.\nOn Wednesday MarginFi, MacBrennan and mrgn had little to reveal about when, or even if, it would launch a governance token that decentralizes its decision-making. Such an asset would theoretically give holders a vote in the operations of MarginFi. If it were airdropped to users it would likely provide a windfall to the thousands of points earners who have farmed MarginFi since July 2023.\n\"The MRGN development team will carry on work towards full decentralization,\" a tweet read.\nThe departure of Pavlovsky will not impact mtnDAO, a biannual month-long coworking event hosted in Salt Lake City by MarginFi and Cypher, said Cypher CEO Barrett Williams, a close friend of Pavlovsky.\n\"I don\u0027t have next steps yet, but as mrgn\u0027s founder it\u0027s ultimately my failure that this happened, and like I\u0027ve done for years, I\u0027ll reflect and evolve,\" Pavlovksy said in his resignation tweet, which came around three hours after SolBlaze\u0027s first accusation.\nLess than an hour later, he was back: \"Okay, what should I build next.\"\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin’s (BTC) much anticipated halving event later this month could see a flurry of bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting upside on both technical and meme coin projects.\nHalving reduces the rate at which new coins are created and lowers the available new supply. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. This event has historically preceded a bull market for the token.\nCrypto traders say participants seek a “reason to buy” as money narratives continuously shift in the current bullish environment and they may turn their focus on the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming weeks.\n“There exists a large, untapped pool of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem that remains dormant, and surprisingly few listed assets that traders can use to gain exposure to the narrative,” the OTC desk of trading firm Wintermute told CoinDesk over email.\n“Should capital begin to rotate into the Bitcoin ecosystem, tokens like $RUNE, $STX, and $ORDI could benefit significantly and outperform,” they added.\nTHORChain’s RUNE and Stack’s STX have been among the top-performing tokens in the past year, CoinGecko data shows, tracking a bitcoin rise. Meme coin ordi (ORDI) – a nod to the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin – has surged over 2,500% since its September issuance.\nMeanwhile, Bartosz Lipinski is the founder of the crypto trading platform Cube.Exchange said in an email that meme coins and the upcoming Runes protocol could rile up risky bets in the bitcoin ecosystem.\n“Ethereum’s high costs and significant network congestion will cause it to take a backseat as Bitcoin-based projects, like Rune, will redirect meme coin hype to the Bitcoin ecosystem because of the novelty,” Lipinski said. “The BRC-20 (Ordinals NFT) standard is likely to be overtaken by Runes, which is expected to launch on the day of the halving.”\n“Runes will aim to replace the standard with fungible tokens, which will enable the efficient creation of meme coins to compete with projects on Base and Solana,” he added, referring to the ongoing frenzy for non-serious tokens in the two ecosystems.\nOrdinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.\nOrdinal volumes were higher than those of usual leaders Ethereum and Solana in the past week, as reported, led by NodeMonkes and Pups. Non-fungible token (NFT) on other networks buying and selling activity declined 95% across all networks in the same period, suggestive of an isolated interest in Ordinals.\n",

    "type": "Policy",
    "summary": "Uniswap’s CEO Hayden Adams took to X on Wednesday to say that the exchange is “ready to fight” after receiving notice that the regulator is planning an enforcement action.\n",
    "content": "Decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap received a notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it intends to pursue an enforcement action, the company disclosed on Wednesday.\nUniswap\u0027s native token, UNI, dropped 9.5% immediately after the news.\nUniswap CEO Hayden Adams announced the receipt of the so-called Wells notice on X, saying he wasn’t surprised, “just annoyed, disappointed, and ready to fight.”\nWells notices are preliminary warnings that inform respondents of the charges the regulator is considering bringing against them. They usually lead to enforcement actions.\nIn a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Uniswap’s COO Mary-Catherine Lader and Chief Legal Officer Marvin Ammori told reporters that the content of the Wells notice was focused on Uniswap acting as an unregistered securities broker and unregistered securities exchange. It remains unclear whether Uniswap’s native token, UNI, was implicated as a potential security in the SEC’s notice.\nAmmori said that he believes that Uniswap does not meet the SEC’s current definition of an exchange. He also pointed to a recent ruling in the SEC\u0027s case against Coinbase – in which a judge said that Coinbase Wallet was not a broker – as a good sign for Uniswap\u0027s ability to beat the SEC on the same charges (the judge ruled that the SEC\u0027s other allegations against Coinbase could move forward).\n“I am confident that the products we offer are legal and that our work is on the right side of history,” Adams wrote. \"But it’s been clear for a while that rather than working to create clear, informed rules, the SEC has decided to focus on attacking long-time good actors like Uniswap and Coinbase. All while letting bad actors like FTX slip by.\"\nAdams said that Uniswap will fight the charges.\n“I\u0027m frustrated that the SEC seems to be more concerned with protecting opaque systems than protecting consumers. And that we\u0027ll have to fight a US government agency to protect our company and our industry,” Adams wrote. “This fight will take years, may go all the way to the Supreme Court, and the future of financial technology and our industry hangs in the balance. If we stand together we can win. I think freedom is worth fighting for. I think DeFi is worth fighting for.”\nAn SEC spokesman said the agency \"does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.\"\nIn a Wednesday blog post, Uniswap wrote that the Wells notice, as well as the SEC’s lawsuits against Coinbase and other crypto companies, indicates that their action against Uniswap is just “the latest political effort to target even the best actors building technology on blockchains.”\nUniswap denies that the tokens it offers for sale are securities, despite the SEC’s position that most tokens besides bitcoin fall under their jurisdiction.\n“The reality is that tokens are a digital file format, like a pdf or spreadsheet, and can store many kinds of value. They are not intrinsically securities, just as every sheet of paper is not a stock certificate,” the blog post said. “The overwhelming volume of traded tokens are definitively not securities – they are stablecoins, community and utility tokens, and commodities like Ethereum and Bitcoin.”\nThe blog post added that, in cases where a token may in fact be a security, “the SEC has refused to create a path for businesses to register.”\nUniswap did not comment further on the matter, aside from directing CoinDesk to Adams\u0027 social media post and the company\u0027s blog post.\nUniswap argued that the SEC has “no authority from Congress” to oversee the crypto markets, citing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s past testimony before Congress that a new law would need to be passed to give the agency the necessary powers to effectively regulate the industry, though Gensler has since argued that the existing securities laws are sufficient for the regulator to police crypto.\nEfforts to pass a comprehensive regulatory framework for the crypto industry have stalled, and will likely remain stagnant ahead of the upcoming presidential election.\nUPDATE 1 (April 10, 2024 at 19:12 UTC): Updated to include additional information about Uniswap\u0027s blog post.\nUPDATE 2 (April 10, 2024 at 19:56 UTC): Updated to include Uniswap\u0027s comments from a press conference.\n\n",

    "content": "Steven Nerayoff, an early adviser to the Ethereum network, has filed a notice of his intent to sue the U.S. government for $9.6 billion in damages connected to his 2019 arrest on criminal extortion charges, which his lawyers called “fabricated” and “baseless.”\nNerayoff’s Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) form, which was provided to CoinDesk by his lawyers, is the first step towards filing a lawsuit against the Department of Justice (DOJ). In FTCA cases, the agencies involved must be notified of the claimant’s intention to sue at least six months before a lawsuit is formally filed.\nWell-known civil liberties lawyer Alan Dershowitz confirmed Wednesday that he will serve as a consultant on constitutional issues for Nerayoff’s case.\nThe government’s charges against Nerayoff were dropped in May 2023. Two months earlier, prosecutors moved to end the case, admitting that they had obtained material exculpatory evidence and were unable to prove the charges in the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt. Nerayoff’s lawyers had, before that, filed a motion to dismiss that was chock-full of explosive claims against the federal investigators and prosecutors involved in the case.\nRead more: U.S. Prosecutors Drop Extortion Charges Against Early Adviser to Ethereum Network\nNerayoff and his lawyers say that he was the victim of an elaborate, years-long setup by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with the ultimate intention of getting him to turn over evidence on important figures in the crypto industry.\nThe FBI did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment by the time of publication.\nOn the morning of Sept. 17, 2019, Nerayoff claims he was arrested by a dozen gun-wielding FBI agents and interrogated for “hours” in an unmarked van parked outside his home. According to Nerayoff, the agents told him he would “not see his young minor children grow old” unless he cooperated by giving them information.\nThe government denied the majority of Nerayoff’s claims in a filing of its own, including the assertion that Nerayoff’s colleague and former co-defendant on the extortion charges, Michael Hlady, was a government informant. Nerayoff’s lawyers maintain that Hlady, who was convicted of swindling Catholic nuns out of nearly $400,000 in 2010, was “insinuated … into [his] orbit” by the FBI, in order to help them build a case against Nerayoff.\nIn 2021, Hlady pleaded guilty to the extortion charges Nerayoff was also tied up in. But last month, the government moved to drop the charges against him and allow him to withdraw his guilty plea, instead having him plead guilty to one count of wire fraud in an unrelated fraud scheme he committed while out on bond.\n",

    "content": "Fantom Foundation co-founder Andre Cronje on Tuesday proposed a plan to fairly and safely issue meme coins on the network, aiming to sidestep risks associated with buying non-serious tokens.\nIssuing and trading meme coins has become a fun and multibillion-dollar sector among crypto investors in the past year. An ongoing meme coin frenzy on Solana and Base networks has netted millions in profits for platform owners and users, but it comes with risks for the community and investors.\nSome risks include teams dumping tokens after creating social media hype, early investors selling large amounts, removal of liquidity, and developers having access to change code for tokens, Cronje said.\nThe proposed plan is to issue tokens with the Fantom Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to Fantom blockchain\u0027s development and maintenance, as one of the signers controlling the token’s liquidity pools.\n“Up to 5% of the tokens to support the meme team expenses. This will be locked in a multisig requiring signatures from 2 project members and at least 1 foundation member,” Cronje said.\n“The remaining 85% of the tokens will be put up in a FTM/token LP in foundation multisig. An amount of 100,000 FTM will be provided. Any Fantom-based exchange can be nominated for LP,” he added. LP refers to liquidity pool, a smart contract on an exchange that holds two or more tokens and facilitates trading.\nUp to 10% of tokens can be allocated for marketing-related expenses, such as exchange listings, and will be locked in a multisig requiring signatures from two project members and at least one Foundation member.\n“Should the FTM in the LP token reach at least 2,000,000 FTM, the original provided 100,000 FTM (5%) will be removed to cover the initial cost and the rest of the LP will be burned,” Cronje added.\nFantom’s Cronje is the latest in a line of blockchain teams that aren’t shying away from engaging with meme coins directly – marking a clear departure from previous cycles in which such tokens were treated as mere tradeable assets.\nAvalanche Foundation, a similar body for the Avalanche network, earlier this year announced a fund that invested directly in and supported the growth of meme coins (which it termed culture coins). In March, it invested in five tokens.\nLast week, BNB Chain developers unveiled a $1 million prize pool that attracted submissions from developers behind meme coins. The pool aimed to award projects it deemed unique for investing in their future growth.\n",

    "type": "Learn",
    "summary": "Following the SEC charges against the world’s largest crypto exchange, people are wondering what’s the difference between Binance and Binance.us, who is Changpeng Zhao and more.\n",
    "content": "Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who is often referred to as just “CZ,” Binance is the world\u0027s leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of June 2023. The company was originally based in China but had to leave Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions shortly after its launch.\nBinance developed its own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (later renamed to BNB Chain), which facilitates trades on the exchange. The native token of the blockchain is Binance coin (BNB) and the company has also launched a stablecoin, BinanceUSD (BUSD). Because of U.S. regulatory rules, Binance created a supposedly separate company for its U.S. clients in 2019, Binance.US.\nOn June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US as well as CZ, who serves as Binance CEO, on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering BNB and BUSD to the general public, calling them unregistered securities. The SEC lawsuit also casts fresh doubt on the independence of the company’s U.S. arm and its staking service.\nRead more about the SEC suit here\nThis is not Binance’s first battle with U.S. regulators. Binance is also under ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who sued CZ and Binance in March 2023, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S.\nHere is everything you need to know about Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao.\nCZ is a well-known personality in crypto, actively engaging with the crypto community through Twitter and speaking at conferences and to the media. As for his origins, he was born in China and emigrated to Canada when he was 12 and says he is a Canadian citizen. In high school, he worked part-time at McDonald’s, which is part of his well-known lore. He graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science.\nAfter college, he worked for the Tokyo stock exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook developing software for the businesses. He then founded a startup in 2005, Fusion Systems, which focused on creating an automated high-frequency trading platform. Following that, he worked for several crypto startups including a stint as co-founder and CTO of OKCoin. Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.\nAccording to the white paper, Zhao\u0027s goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support.\nShortly after Binance’s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper.\nBinance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China’s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance’s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based.\nBinance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance\u0027s proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange.\nBinance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance’s services.\nOne of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange.\nThe other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees.\nFinally, unlike Binance’s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange.\nJuly 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO.\nJuly 2018: Binance acquires Trust Wallet, a free, non-custodial mobile wallet to support its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) offering.\nJanuary 2019: Binance starts to offer support for new token listings through ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings), through its Launchpad product.\nApril 2019: Binance migrates BNB from Ethereum to its proprietary chain, then called Binance Smart Chain (now rebranded to Binance chain or BNB chain)\nApril 2019: Binance launches its DEX ahead of schedule.\nMay 2019: Binance gets hacked for the first time. Hackers steal over 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) from Binance (the equivalent of roughly $41 million at the time). Zhao quickly took to social media to reassure users that no one lost funds and that Binance used its reserve funds to cover the costs of the stolen crypto. CZ\u0027s \"Funds are #SAFU\" tweet has become a meme in the crypto space.\nJune 2019: Binance announces it will launch a new trading platform for U.S. customers, in partnership with a firm called BAM Trading Services.\nJuly 2019: Binance hires former Ripple executive, Catherine Coley, to run its planned U.S. marketplace.\nSeptember 2019: Binance launches its own dollar-backed stablecoin, BUSD in partnership with the Paxos Trust Company.\nSeptember 2019: Binance.US launches in 37 states. The new marketplace supports six cryptocurrencies at launch: bitcoin, (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and BNB. BUSD is notably not supported at launch.\nApril 2020: Binance buys CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data provider, for a rumored $400 million, making it one of the biggest M\u0026A deals in crypto. “CoinMarketCap has more users than any other product in the crypto space,” Zhao said at the time. “It’s a very valuable platform.”\nSeptember 2020: Binance rolls out Launchpool, a crypto staking platform.\nNovember 2020: Binance notifies U.S. customers they have a hard deadline of two weeks to migrate to the new platform before Binance shutters their accounts.\nApril 2021: Binance.US hires Brian Brooks as CEO to replace Catherine Coley in the role.\nAugust 2021: Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks quits over “strategic differences” after just months in the job.\nSeptember 2021: Binance.US promotes Brian Schroder to CEO; he formerly served as president and board member for the firm.\nApril 2022: Binance.US raises $200 million in its first funding round, giving it a $4.5 billion valuation.\nSeptember 2022: Binance announces it will stop supporting the second-largest stablecoin USDC and automatically convert customer funds to BUSD.\nOctober 2022: Binance suffers another major hack, and had to briefly halt trading on BNB after a “potential exploit” drained $100 million in crypto.\nOctober 2022: Binance confirms it has contributed $500 million towards Elon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter.\nNovember 2022: Amidst the collapse of FTX, there was a brief moment when Binance was going to buy the rival exchange. That deal quickly collapsed as the scope of FTX’s issues came to light.\nDecember 2022: Binance.US reaches an agreement to buy Voyager Digital\u0027s assets for just over $1 billion. Voyager, had gone into bankruptcy earlier in 2022 and originally had agreed to sell its assets to FTX, which folded itself.\nFebruary 2023: BUSD issuer Paxos is hit with a one-two punch of an investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice from the SEC, which some believed hinted at Binance as a future target for the SEC. Following these actions, Paxos halted minting BUSD.\nMarch 2023: The CFTC sues CZ and Binance over allegations that the company offered unregistered crypto derivatives products.\nApril 2023: Rumors of an Interpol “Red Notice” for CZ tank BNB price, but there is little to back up the claim.\nApril 2023: Binance.US pulls out of a $1 billion deal to buy Voyager Digital’s assets, attributing the termination to the \"hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.\"\nJune 2023: The SEC files charges against Binance.US and its founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws with BNB token and Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin. The suit also alleges that Binance\u0027s staking service violated securities law as well as that the entities of Binance.US and Binance were not truly independent.\n",

Built in collaboration with the Chainlink Foundation and developer Chainlink Labs, the “Transporter” app aims to provide a user-friendly interface for submitting and monitoring cross-chain transactions on CCIP, according to a statement shared with The Block. “Transporter makes it easier to utilize the security benefits of Chainlink CCIP for the transfer of large token value and critical messages across chains,” Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said. “Having a secure way to move both value and data across chains is something the blockchain industry has needed for years and I’m excited that Transporter is making that more accessible.” Multi-chain support Transporter initially supports token transfers across multiple blockchain networks, including Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Optimism and Polygon. It doesn’t charge additional fees beyond existing transaction costs and CCIP service provider fees. Venture capital firms Fourth Revolution Capital and Moonrock Capital are among the app\u0027s early users.

Chainlink also unveiled a new CCIP token transfer tool on Thursday that enables native ETH to be transferred cross-chain through WETH token pools. This marks the first time a lock-and-unlock mechanism has been implemented in CCIP. Chainlink rolled out its CCIP in an early access phase on Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon in July 2023. In January this year, it also integrated Circle’s cross-chain transfer protocol (CCTP) with CCIP for USDC stablecoin transfers across different blockchains.

Going under the working title of the LONDON token, Rose’s plan would see a £1 billion liquidity pool created via a one-off tax on the profits made by the city\u0027s financial institutions. According to Rose\u0027s campaign team, the plan is to make the new cryptocurrency accepted across London\u0027s transport network and usable for paying council bills, parking charges and other expenses.

Strangely enough our schools don\u0027t teach it, yet this ignorance has devastating consequences because it cuts across all aspects of life: money is needed for business, for family, for retirement, for entertainment, for everything,\" Rose said. Rose added that the LONDON token, equipped with inherent utility and a substantial liquidity pool, could serve as an ideal means to offer essential financial education to every individual in Greater London.

    "summary": "While the Pandora team describes ERC-404 as a “Frankenstein’s monster,” it claims there’s method in its madness.\nA team of four have combined the ERC-20 token standard and NFTs to create a new standard of semi-fungible tokens called ERC-404.\nWe explore how this came to be, how the project works and what’s next.\n",
    "content": "It was around 9 AM in Toronto, Canada, on Feb. 1 when a designer and crypto trader who goes by ctrl on X — his real name is Arya Khalaj — thought he had stumbled onto something brilliant. The project was called Emerald and it claimed to combine ERC-20 tokens with NFTs in a way that could solve NFT liquidity issues for good. It appeared to be the solution for a lot of issues ctrl had come across while working with different crypto projects. He went all in. While chatting online with a friend known pseudonymously as Searn, they started throwing in clips of ether. During this time, the chart just kept going up. Once they ran out of ether, they dipped into their investments in other projects and were soon in to the tune of around $60,000 each. Then, without warning, the project was exploited and the bottom fell out of the chart. Ctrl — who was holed up in a small Airbnb as his lease had expired during a three-month trip to Tokyo — was devastated. “We were sitting there, in total shock, and we were like, what just happened?” he told The Block in an interview. The two crypto traders spoke with a friend and former Coinbase engineer known pseudonymously as Acme about the situation. They reached out to the developer of Emerald and asked if they could help fix the project and bring it back to life. Yet the developer seemed uninterested in getting any help, they said, and planned to relaunch anyway with a quick patch. Acme took a look at the code, said it was barely designed to work at all anyway and would require a full rewrite. So that’s what they did. “We\u0027d been up all night,” said ctrl. “We stayed up for the next 26 hours or so after that. So we\u0027ve been up for two days at this point, just building this thing in a single sprint.” At the end of it, they had built a working implementation of a token standard that combines ERC-20 tokens and NFTs. They called it ERC-404, named after the common website error message. “We thought it was a fitting name because the whole thing was so experimental and we knew it would confuse many protocols and dapps when we launched it because it has mixed ERC-721 and ERC-20 functions,” said ctrl. What is an ERC-404 token? While ERC-20 tokens are fungible tokens that can be replaced by any other token, NFTs are unique tokens that are non-fungible, and can’t be switched like-for-like. ERC-404 combines both ideas to create what the team calls a semi-fungible token. The team acknowledged that this creates some sort of Frankenstein’s monster. “It\u0027s just a matter of actually understanding how to mix two things that have never been mixed and weren’t designed to be mixed together — and are actually conflicting,” ctrl said. In practice, it looks like this: a project can offer 100 tokens and 100 NFTs, for example, where each token is linked to an NFT. If someone buys less than a whole token, the NFT is burned and they just have a fraction of a token. If they combine this with more fractions of a token, an NFT is minted back into their wallet. The core idea is that it allows people to buy and sell NFTs, as well as parts of an NFT, where the parts are represented as tokens. Since two halves of a token can be combined to create an NFT, the tokens should, in theory, retain the value of the underlying NFT potential — even when it\u0027s temporarily gone. Two half tokens will be worth half of a whole token and NFT combo because they can be combined at will to create the whole token with the corresponding NFT. The only issue is that combining two tokens won\u0027t return the same NFT, so its value might be a bit variable — but this will also depend on the specific project in question as each project can implement the token standard in its own way; choosing how many NFTs they want per token and how the NFTs are regenerated. For instance, a project might generate new NFTs every time they’re minted, or they might have all NFTs look the same. With NFTs getting constantly minted and burned, this raises the question of whether the token design will result in a lot of costly transaction fees. A developer known as quit on X noted that the current system is more expensive than current NFT projects. The team acknowledged that this is a potential issue but said they have been focused on optimizing it. Opening Pandora’s box The team of four — comprising ctrl, Searn, Acme and another individual known as Hohenheim — named their project Pandora and created the first token under the ERC-404 token standard on Feb. 2. It’s worth noting that while they have done some tests, it’s still unaudited and carries some risk.

The NFTs are in the form of boxes with five different colors — each with varying levels of rarity — that may later reveal different artwork. Anyone who buys a token will get an NFT — and, if they spend half of that token, the NFT is destroyed. When new NFTs are minted, they are randomized, meaning that the distribution and rarity can change over time. This means users need to be careful they don’t accidentally destroy their own rare NFTs, which could get replaced with more common ones. “[ERC-404] allows you to do things that were never possible with ERC-721. And because of that, there are a lot of different implementations, a lot of different ways you could approach the concepts. We obviously had to just choose one,” said ctrl. “But people are already doing their own things.” At launch, 7% of the supply was allocated to the team and early contributors. Upon launch, the team purchased 23% of the total supply to be used to provide extra liquidity through market makers or for token listings. So far, the project has seen $100 million of trading volume on decentralized exchanges. The token has reached a price of around $12,800, giving the project a fully diluted valuation of $125 million, while the NFTs have reached a similar floor price. Some projects are testing the waters Since launch, a few projects have started experimenting with the Pandora token. On-chain index project Peopods Finance has added the Pandora token so it can be wrapped and used to generate yield. Lending platform Teller has added it so it can be used as collateral for loans. Furthermore, trading platform Wasabi Protocol has listed it, enabling perpetual trading of the token. In the near term, the team is planning to propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal — something that, if accepted, would make Ethereum better designed to support this sort of token standard. Hohenheim said the team didn’t want to give a hard timeline but that it’s talking about a number of days, not weeks, before doing so. The team is also preparing to launch a protocol very soon that could speed up the adoption of ERC-404 tokens, ctrl said. It would provide creators and developers with the tools and infrastructure for building products involving ERC-404 tokens. “What we\u0027re doing now is we are focused less on the usual NFT gimmicks and more on building, like actual functional, usable, user-facing products, that also integrate with our collection and that make people want to hold our collection because of the incentives that they get,” he said. Why create ERC-404 tokens? While understanding how ERC-20 tokens and NFTs can be combined together is one thing, another question is why anyone would want to do so. The Pandora team said there were two main reasons why this makes sense. The first is that it could help with liquidity for NFTs. Ctrl said that any NFT built on the ERC-404 standard would have liquidity as long as there’s a liquidity pool. This means any NFT can be sold at any time without needing to find a buyer counterparty. “People get mad when people floor 40 [NFTs] at a time. Well, now you effectively have a token price that reflects a floor price in real-time, and there\u0027s no such thing as a thick or third floor because there is actual native liquidity,” he said. The second reason is that it can provide native fractionalization of NFTs. Right now, to fractionalize an NFT, you need to lock it up and create a number of tokens that represent the overall NFT — something that is tricky to unwind and piece back together. By providing native fractionalization, the idea is that ERC-404 tokens could offer a better user experience. “That\u0027s why native fractionalization is such a big deal, I think, because it\u0027s actually a feature built in,” said ctrl. “People don\u0027t need to feel like they have to go and do some weird four-step process and get this kind of legitimate NFT that\u0027s a derivative.” Ctrl also noted that NFTs using the ERC-404 token standard could be applied in the gaming industry, particularly when it comes to the gamification of destroying and reminting NFTs with a randomization factor. If successful, this would incentivize more trading of these tokens, something that could spur wider adoption. Although that\u0027s assuming people will be able to get their heads around semi-fungibility of course. Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

    "content": "Blockchains are poised to become a foundational element of digital infrastructure. This report focuses on fundamental differences in blockchain design that have been chosen by different protocols to pave the way for mass adoption. Despite all modern blockchains aiming to deliver public rails that are performant and secure, their approaches and timelines to achieve those goals vary. To shed light on these differences, we outline the main functions blockchains perform and introduce a framework to categorize them. With case study-type analyses of Ethereum and Cosmos, along with a thorough review of Solana’s design approach, we compare their strengths and weaknesses. Our study highlights the critical differences between horizontal and vertical scaling and the trade-offs between them. This comparison provides a detailed perspective on the technological choices and strategies influencing the evolution of smart contract platforms as the backbone of a growing on-chain financial economy.

Part 2 contextualizes the tradeoffs required for scaling blockchains across each function (such as data storage or execution), highlighting the way in which scalability optimization impacts important properties such as decentralization, security and interoperability. Part 3 takes a deep dive into Solana’s design philosophy as an execution-focused, vertically integrated blockchain, as well as the many unique hurdles it has faced in the pursuit of achieving greater scalability. Finally, Part 4 compares the key design choices taken by protocols in the context of their varying scaling approaches, offering insights into their progress to date alongside critical commentary from the builders and thinkers shaping the future of blockchain design.

    "type": "Crypto Ecosystems",
    "summary": "Crypto projects are offering points instead of airdrops — to the delight of VCs and the chagrin of everyone else.\nIn lieu of airdrops, crypto projects have been handing out points to reward loyal users.\nWhile many investors complain, VCs argue that there’s an upside here.\n",
    "content": "If there’s one thing that’s united members of the crypto community in recent months, it’s the emergence of points. Only they’re not in favor of them, but dead set against them. “Points are probably the stupidest detour crypto has taken in my time here. Also borderline scammy,” said Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, on X. This frustrated sentiment can be seen in the responses to new projects announcing their points programs. “Wow nice some points, how exciting. Imagine doing tokens when you could give points,” sarcastically replied one X user on Jan. 23 when crypto wallet Rabby revealed its new program — while others were even harsher in their criticisms. Why do points get a bad rep? It’s not hard to see why. Over the last few years, projects have rewarded loyal users and successful airdrop hunters with sudden issuances of tokens, often worth thousands of dollars — and sometimes in the regions of hundreds of thousands of dollars. For some, it can be life-changing money. Unsurprisingly, this phenomenon resulted in an entire ecosystem of airdrop hunters looking to cash in on the next big airdrop. But points are antithetical to what the airdrop hunter is looking for. With airdrops, those who carried out some trades in the hope of an airdrop and got lucky when it arrived felt like they had beaten the system in some way — that their ingenuity, or sheer luck, had resulted in this unexpected windfall. Yet with points, users are obeying the system and being obedient, hoping that the system will look kindly upon them and reward their loyal actions with tokens some day. There\u0027s no edge to be gained and it’s simply just not as fun. Beyond this, points are more of an IOU that might never be delivered upon, just a number on a screen that harks back to the days of web2. They’re not onchain, they can’t be traded and they might not turn into any tokens. Most crucially, they’re not worth anything — and maybe never will. A visual take on the emergence of points. Image: Bold Leonidas via X. Some investors also worry that points don’t have the same staying power as the lure of a potential airdrop. “Founders think \"points\" are smart and easy mode for them, locking the users in indefinitely. But that\u0027s not true; in fact, it\u0027s the opposite. Users cannot be everywhere at once, and their attention gets diluted,” said Long Solitude, a pseudonymous investor at VC firm Zee Prime Capital, on X. KVK, a pseudonymous investor director at VC firm HASH CIB, concurred that users have a short attention span and noted that most point programs lack a clear end date, making it worse. “In a world where there is a protocol with a new point-based system every day, it is super hard to stay relevant over time,” they said in a Substack post devoted to points. “Attention is one of the critical ingredients for success, and your quasi-infinite points program (from a user’s perspective) does not help you capture it.” Out of curiosity, The Block tried to see how many points had been issued in total. As the points aren\u0027t on a blockchain, we had to download apps, check leaderboards and reach out to projects directly to get answers. In the end, we totaled up some 40.6 billion points across 12 projects — however meaningless that number is. FriendTech: Points but no airdrop FriendTech is a clear example showing why users have been disaffected by points. The project was one of the first to implement a clear points system in its app in a bid to reward engagement. Each week it would drop points based on an unspecified allocation system to its users — something that worked brilliantly until it didn’t.

Yet this quickly dwindled. Over the next three and a half months, it saw just a much slower $126 million of trading volume while the number of daily transactions collapsed. The number of daily transactions on FriendTech has significantly reduced. Image: TK research via Dune Analytics. Part of the reason is that in the beginning, traders were optimistic that the points would lead to an imminent airdrop. At the time, a pseudonymous crypto influencer known as Dingaling — who had one of the most expensive channels — said FriendTech would remain successful until the token airdrop. When the project received investment from Paradigm, this spurred hopes that one was on the way. Yet one has so far not taken place, and anyone who burned money hoping for a greater allocation has seemingly lost out. Why do VCs like points? While many retail investors complain about points, the one class of crypto investors that seem to like them is venture capitalists. One key element is that points are more flexible than token issuance, which can’t be changed on a whim. “While points can\u0027t replace product-market fit, they provide the flexibility to test assumptions without the complexities and costs associated with launching tokens,” Dmitriy Berenzon, partner at VC firm Archetype, told The Block. Multicoin Capital Partner Tushar Jain agreed that points are useful for incentives prior to a token launch. “Launching a token is a lot of work, and it’s much harder to change economics once the token is live,” he said in the firm’s outlook for 2024. A partner at VC firm Dragonfly, who goes by GM, said offering points enabled NFT marketplace Blur to fine-tune its incentives between seasons. Blur is currently on its third season of points. They added that Blur leaving some of the points criteria undisclosed helped it to avoid wash trading. Edvin Memet, a researcher at The Block Pro Research, argued that airdrops with blind criteria tend to encourage more organic use, typically leading to larger allocations. “An airdrop with blind criteria may not attract as many users pre-airdrop, but it stands out as the fairest method for rewarding genuine users. Additionally, it is the most likely system to lead to substantial airdrop allocations, which can create a lot of publicity and attract new users post-airdrop,” he said, pointing to liquid staking project Jito as an example. Memet noted that Manta’s particular point-based system enabled it to attract a higher amount of value locked in its smart contracts than it would have received otherwise. The project also kept hold of the value by auto-staking ether that was bridged to it. He said he anticipates that other Layer 1 and Layer 2 projects will employ similar systems in the future. Jain also noted that points help to avoid some of the regulatory risks seen with airdropping tokens because they don’t have value. “Points have no units, no max supply, and less regulatory risk because they are not transferable,” he said. Some VCs are aware, though, that points may not have an infinite staying power. “I see it as a new narrative, a new thing, an exciting thing in crypto, but whether it is just a temporary fad is yet to be seen,” Kavita Gupta, founder and general partner of Delta Blockchain Fund, told The Block. “We will definitely have everything continue to use point incentive systems, but I think it is more going to be about attracting customers than being able to retain them for a long time because everybody will end up giving some sort of features like this.” Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

ECB keeps rates steady The eurozone’s key interest rate remained unchanged at 4%, the main refinancing rate at 4.5% and the marginal lending facility at 4.75%. Today\u0027s decision means that interest rates across the eurozone will stay at their highest level in over two decades. RELATED INDICES See crypto indices The ECB said it would only be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction if the central bank receives further evidence that inflation is converging to the target in a sustained manner. Possibility of ECB rate cut in June PIMCO Portfolio Manager Konstantin Veit suggested that if incoming data, particularly concerning wages and profits, aligns with the scenario outlined in the March projections, the ECB will likely implement rate cuts in June. In an email sent to The Block, Veit anticipated that once the ECB begins reducing rates, it will do so cautiously, opting for conventional 25 basis point steps. The analyst observed that market expectations have adjusted to reflect a significant reduction in anticipated rate cuts and highlighted that market risks now lean towards fewer cuts. \"Risks are probably towards less cuts, mainly on the back of sticky services inflation, a resilient labour market, loose financial conditions and ECB risk management considerations,\" Veit said.

    "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is a regulatory agency in the U.S. tasked with protecting investors, maintaining fair and efficient markets and facilitating capital formation. The SEC was established in 1934 during the Great Depression and following Congress\u0027 passage of the Securities Act of 1933, which is the first federal law that regulated the issuance of securities. The agency was created to regulate and enforce that legislation. The SEC oversees broker-dealers, investment companies, investment advisers, clearing agencies, transfer agents, credit rating agencies and securities exchanges. The agency also oversees organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The agency\u0027s jurisdiction was further expanded in 2010 following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act to include municipal advisors among others. Within the SEC The agency\u0027s leadership is made up of up to five commissioners appointed by the President based on advice and consent from the Senate. There can not be more than three commissioners in the same political party. There are also multiple divisions within the agency including ones focused on enforcement, corporation finance, economic and risk analysis, examinations, trading and markets and investment management. All play unique roles in bolstering the agency. For example, the Division of Corporation Finance makes sure investors are provided with material information to then make informed investment decisions while the Division of Enforcement investigates possible violations of the federal securities laws. The SEC\u0027s three objectives The agency is tasked with protecting investors and aims to ensure that investors have access to accurate and relevant information about securities being offered for public sale and that they are protected from fraudulent or manipulative practices. The SEC also works to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets by regulating exchanges, securities brokers, dealers, and other market participants. Lastly, the SEC plays a role in facilitating the capital-raising process for companies by overseeing the issuance of new securities and ensuring compliance with regulations.

Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton cracked down on initial coin offerings in 2017 and raised concerns that they could be offering much less investor protection than in more traditional markets which could lead to more fraud and manipulation. The current chair, Gary Gensler, has warned that crypto exchanges need to register with the agency. Over the past year, the SEC has cracked down on firms, including Coinbase and Kraken for allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, dealer and clearinghouse. The SEC also sued Binance in 2023 for similar charges along with alleging that the exchange lied to customers and misdirecting capital to separate investment funds owned by its former CEO Changpeng Zhao. Nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, have also come under the SEC\u0027s scrutiny recently. The agency brought charges against a Los Angeles-based podcasting studio Impact Theory for allegedly conducting an unregistered offering of NFTs. A month later the agency charged NFT project Stoner Cats 2 LLC with allegedly conducting an unregistered offering of NFTs. Lawmakers are working on legislation to bring clarity to how cryptocurrencies should be regulated, but none have been signed into law yet. Spot bitcoin ETF greenlight In a significant move for the crypto industry, the SEC approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in early 2024, years after Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss first filed a spot bitcoin ETF application with the agency back in 2013. A turning point for the SEC\u0027s eventual approval was a pivotal ruling during the summer of 2023 when a panel of judges mandated the SEC to re-evaluate Grayscale Investments\u0027 proposal for a spot bitcoin ETF. The court specifically addressed the SEC\u0027s treatment of spot bitcoin ETFs and bitcoin futures ETFs in their opinion. Prior to its approval, Grayscale showed in its proposed bitcoin ETF that it was similar to already approved bitcoin futures ETFs in both the underlying assets and in surveillance sharing agreements. It should have \"the same likelihood of detecting fraudulent or manipulative conduct in the market for bitcoin and bitcoin futures,\" the court said at the time. The SEC approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs from companies including BlackRock and Fidelity, though the agency\u0027s Chair Gensler noted that it did not mean the agency was endorsing bitcoin. That approval provided institutional and retail investors with a way to get exposure to bitcoin through more traditional investment channels. Since then, spot bitcoin ETFs have seen billions of dollars of inflows. The SEC has not yet approved any spot Ethereum ETFs.

The agency also oversees organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\nThe agency\u0027s jurisdiction was further expanded in 2010 following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act to include municipal advisors among others.\nThe agency\u0027s leadership is made up of up to five commissioners appointed by the President based on advice and consent from the Senate. There can not be more than three commissioners in the same political party.\nThere are also multiple divisions within the agency including ones focused on enforcement, corporation finance, economic and risk analysis, examinations, trading and markets and investment management.\nAll play unique roles in bolstering the agency. For example, the Division of Corporation Finance makes sure investors are provided with material information to then make informed investment decisions while the Division of Enforcement investigates possible violations of the federal securities laws.\nThe SEC\u0027s three objectives\nThe agency is tasked with protecting investors and aims to ensure that investors have access to accurate and relevant information about securities being offered for public sale and that they are protected from fraudulent or manipulative practices.\nThe SEC also works to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets by regulating exchanges, securities brokers, dealers, and other market participants.\nLastly, the SEC plays a role in facilitating the capital-raising process for companies by overseeing the issuance of new securities and ensuring compliance with regulations.\nPast and current SEC chairs have said many cryptocurrencies could be defined as securities, according to news reports. Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton cracked down on initial coin offerings in 2017 and raised concerns that they could be offering much less investor protection than in more traditional markets which could lead to more fraud and manipulation.\nThe current chair, Gary Gensler, has warned that crypto exchanges need to register with the agency. Over the past year, the SEC has cracked down on firms, including Coinbase and Kraken for allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, dealer and clearinghouse. The SEC also sued Binance in 2023 for similar charges along with alleging that the exchange lied to customers and misdirecting capital to separate investment funds owned by its former CEO Changpeng Zhao.\nThe agency brought charges against a Los Angeles-based podcasting studio Impact Theory for allegedly conducting an unregistered offering of NFTs. A month later the agency charged NFT project Stoner Cats 2 LLC with allegedly conducting an unregistered offering of NFTs.\nLawmakers are working on legislation to bring clarity to how cryptocurrencies should be regulated, but none have been signed into law yet.\nmandated the SEC to re-evaluate Grayscale Investments\u0027 proposal for a spot bitcoin ETF.\nThe court specifically addressed the SEC\u0027s treatment of spot bitcoin ETFs and bitcoin futures ETFs in their opinion. Prior to its approval, Grayscale showed in its proposed bitcoin ETF that it was similar to already approved bitcoin futures ETFs in both the underlying assets and in surveillance sharing agreements. It should have \"the same likelihood of detecting fraudulent or manipulative conduct in the market for bitcoin and bitcoin futures,\" the court said at the time.\nDisclaimer: This article was produced with the assistance of OpenAI’s ChatGPT 3.5/4 and reviewed and edited by our editorial team. © 2023 The Block.

    "content": "The positioning of ether options for May\u0027s end-of-month expiry shows investors have a lack of confidence in the chances for an imminent approval of a spot ether exchange-traded fund and anticipate significant price swings, an analyst said. May 23 marks the 240-day window for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to decide on a spot ether ETF proposal from VanEck. Following that, a decision on the ARK/21Shares filing is due by May 24 and a decision on Hashdex\u0027s proposal is expected by May 30. In January, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart set the chances of a May approval at 60%, then dropped his expectations to 35%, but finally decided that the applications would ultimately be denied. According to YouHodler Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha Lienkha, this growing doubt is playing out in derivatives markets. \"Ether options expiring at the end of May show us a significant volatility increase in the zone of the $3,600 strike price, so the possible surpassing of this price level by the spot market would be accompanied by elevated volatility. At the same time, the implied volatility curve could be adjusted by new facts or SEC rhetoric during the following month,\" Lienkha told The Block. May expiry options not valued over those for April Speaking to The Block, cryptocurrency derivatives trader Gordon Grant said that, over the past month, market participants have sold down April volatility in favor of May. He said this was evidenced by the upward-sloping term structure and compression in realized movements of the ETH +0.23% /USD price. RELATED INDICES See crypto indices However, Grant now observes that, following the sharp rally and partial reversal in the ether spot price earlier this week, this situation has now reversed — and that May is not excessively valued over April. \"There does not appear to be an excessively rich valuation of May in terms of the so-called calendar butterfly when compared to adjacent months,\" Grant added. For April expiries, Grant said that market participants appeared to have taken shorter positions, expecting levels of this month\u0027s implied volatility to remain stable or decrease and for actual movements of ether to be constrained as derivatives traders are factor adjusting the expected movement of implied volatility for this month compared to later months – and, in particular, the month of May. Ether increased by a muted 0.36% in the past 24 hours and was changing hands for $3,532 at 7:59 a.m. ET, according to The Block\u0027s Price Page. The GM 30 Index, representing a selection of the top 30 cryptocurrencies, has increased by 0.19% to 148.05 in the past 24 hours.

    "content": "Stanslavs/ shutterstock.com\nKraken is set to delist the privacy coin Monero XMR -0.43% from the platform for customers in Ireland and Belgium on June 10. In a notice posted earlier today, the crypto exchange clarified that all XMR trading and deposits will halt from May 10 and that all margin positions should be closed by this date to avoid forced closure. Kraken stated that XMR withdrawals will then be halted on June 10, at which time any remaining XMR balance will be automatically converted into bitcoin. Kraken’s decision follows Binance’s delisting of Monero from its main platform in February after placing “monitoring tags” on several privacy coins in January. Binance previously moved to delist privacy coins in Belgium in September 2023. Rival crypto exchange OKX also delisted Monero, alongside privacy-focused coins Zcash and Dash, in January.

It would then enter application three years after publication, around summer 2027. AMLR prohibits CASPs (crypto-asset service providers) from providing accounts for privacy coins, though such practice is already widespread. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets legislation (MiCA), which came into force in June 2023 and will be fully applicable from Dec. 30, 2024, already prohibits crypto assets with built-in anonymization.

    "content": "The crypto community erupted into panic over the weekend amid incorrect reports that the EU was banning anonymous crypto wallets and self-custodial payments. The reports seemingly misinterpreted comments from Patrick Breyer, a member of the European Parliament, on Thursday, confirming its economic and monetary policy committee\u0027s approval of the new EU Anti Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR) and its final text. The misinformation went viral, warning that “payments to self-custody bitcoin and crypto wallets are now illegal.” However, others were quick to respond to the overreaction. “This needs to be taken seriously but, as always, it\u0027s crucial to read the text of the actual legislation. TLDR self-custody is not illegal,” Freddie New, Head of Policy at Bitcoin Policy UK, said. “Fake news isn\u0027t it? I read the article and it says if you\u0027re hosting wallets for other people they need KYC (which is the same in America),” crypto influencer Jordan Fish, aka Cobie, added. “Seems maybe they\u0027re also ‘banning’ you sending from a CEX to self-hosted without identifying who it is. But since self-custody to self-custody is unaffected, and self-custody still allowed, just withdraw from CEX to your own self-custody?” Circle’s EU Strategy and Policy Director Patrick Hansen also moved to swiftly debunk the reports. “Self custody wallets are not banned. Payments to/from self custody wallets are not banned. P2P transfers are explicitly excluded from AMLR, as are self custody software and hardware wallets,” he said. “However, paying with crypto (for example to merchants) with a non KYC’d self custody wallet will be more difficult/banned depending on the merchants set up. This change, as well as the lower thresholds for anonymous cash payments, has unfortunately been agreed months ago,” he added. So, what does the AMLR actually mean for crypto in the EU? Hansen explained that the AMLR is not a crypto regulation — it is a broad anti-money laundering/counter-terrorist financing framework that applies to institutions classified as “obliged entities” or “OEs.” These include all financial institutions, as well as the so-called “CASPs” (crypto-asset service providers), but also other institutions like gambling services that could be prone to AML/CFT risk. However, the AMLR explicitly excludes providers of hardware and software, like Ledger, as well as self-custody wallets, like MetaMask, that do not have access to or control over users’ crypto assets. All CASPs, such as centralized crypto exchanges and custodial wallet providers regulated under Markets in Crypto-Assets legislation (MiCA), will need to follow standard KYC/AML procedures like customer due diligence. Yet they are already subject to these obligations under current AMLD5 legislation, Hansen explained. MiCA is a regulatory framework proposed by the European Union to govern digital assets and their markets that came into force in June 2023 and will be fully applicable from Dec. 30, 2024. “The AMLR (Art. 58) now explicitly prohibits CASPs to provide anonymous accounts, meaning a custodial crypto business cannot provide services for anonymous users. This is already prohibited under existing AML rules anyway, so nothing new,” Hansen said. However, others warned, this could impact non-KYC custodial Bitcoin Lightning wallets like Wallet of Satoshi. Additionally, CASPs will not be able to provide accounts for privacy coins, though such practice is already widespread, and MiCA already prohibits crypto assets with built-in anonymization.

It brings the transactions in line with the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR), the EU\u0027s implementation of the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) travel rule, but this is nothing new either, Hansen added. Regarding merchant payments, AMLR also limits cash payments to €10,000 ($10,830). There are no restrictions on using self-custodial wallets for buying goods or services in the EU. However, should customers want to use a CASP such as BitPay to buy goods or services with crypto, the CASP will need to verify users’ identity and implement additional KYC/AML measures if the transaction (single or combined) is worth more than €1,000 ($1,083). Not fully enforced for three years and it could have been worse “The AMLR is not a ban of self-custody payments, self-custody wallets or P2P transfers,\" Hansen concluded. “It mostly reiterates AML/CFT rules for CASPs and other OEs, but for the most part, these rules were already mandatory and common business practice anyway (from AMLD5, MiCA, TFR).” It also could have been worse, with Hansen describing the final version as a “great outcome” for the crypto industry. “Previous versions of the proposed AMLR proposed a way stricter approach that would have meant a KYC on the self-custody originator/beneficiary, but also thanks to industry efforts a risk-based approach with various options was finally agreed on.” Parliament proposed limiting merchant payments from a self-custody wallet to €1,000, which was removed from the final version. It also previously proposed including DAOs, DeFi, NFT platforms and even developers under AMLR’s scope, Hansen said, arguing the impact from the legislation would now be “extremely limited.” The approved AMLR text only needs to pass final, purely formal, approval in the European Parliament, likely at the end of April, and in the Council of the EU. It would then enter application three years after publication, around summer 2027, according to Hansen. EU markets watchdog moves closer to finalizing rules under MiCA The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) advanced its efforts to implement the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation by publishing its first report and launching a third consultation on Monday. The report outlines draft requirements for firms seeking authorization under MiCA, aiming to standardize the regulatory landscape for crypto assets within the EU. Additionally, the ESMA seeks feedback on rules to combat market abuse and ensure proper service delivery in the crypto sector, with the MiCA framework set to be fully enforced by December.
