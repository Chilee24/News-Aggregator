    "content": "In recent months, the Ethereum staking landscape has witnessed significant transformations, prompting a shift in investor preferences and reshaping the sector’s dynamics. According to on-chain data researcher and strategist at 21Shares, Tom Wan, key metrics indicate a notable change in the approach towards Ethereum staking, with restaking gaining prominence as a preferred method. Ethereum Restaking Landscape Wan’s observations, shared on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), highlight a steady increase in ETH staking deposits from restaking, rising from 10% to 60% since 2024. Restaking can be accomplished in two primary ways: through ETH natively restaked or by utilizing a liquid staking token (LST). By staking their ETH, users secure additional applications known as Actively Validated Services (AVS), which yield additional staking rewards. A significant player in the staking landscape is EigenLayer, which has emerged as the second-largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol on the Ethereum network. Related Reading: Are The Odds In Bitcoin Bulls Favor? These Analysts Forecast BTC’s Future EigenLayer has achieved a significant milestone with the release of EigenDA, its data availability Actively Validated Service (AVS), on the mainnet. According to a research report by Kairos, this launch marks the beginning of a new era in restaking, where liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) will become the dominant way for restakers to do business. Currently, 73% of all deposits on EigenLayer are made through liquid restaking tokens. The report highlights that the growth rate of LRT deposits has been significant, increasing by over 13,800% in less than four months, from approximately $71.74 million on December 1, 2023, to $10 billion on April 9, 2024, demonstrating the growing confidence in EigenLayer’s approach to restaking and contributing to the shifting tides in Ethereum’s staking landscape. According to Wan, the rise of liquid restaking protocols has also contributed to a decline in the dominance of Lido (LDO), a staking service solution for Solana (SOL), Ethereum, and Terra (LUNC). On the other hand, Etherfi has emerged as the second-largest stETH withdrawer, with 108,000 stETH withdrawn through the first quarter of 2024. This trend exemplifies the increasing popularity of liquid restaking protocols, allowing stakers to withdraw and actively utilize their staked assets while still earning rewards. Ether.fi Set To Surpass Binance In ETH Staking Data provided by Wan also shows a decline in the dominance of centralized exchanges (CEXs) in ETH staking. Since 2024, CEXs have seen their share of staking decline from 29.7% to 25.8%, a significant drop of 3.7%. As a result, the decentralized staking provider Kiln Finance has surpassed Binance and become the third-largest entity in terms of ETH staking. With Ether.fi poised to follow suit, it is expected to surpass Binance’s position shortly, according to the researcher.

    "content": "As the BTC halving event gets closer, Bitcoin’s market behavior is becoming more unpredictable. Even though it went up and down a lot last month, BTC has now gone over $72,000 again, and it looks like it might jump much higher soon after the halving. Crypto investors are searching for new tokens that weren’t slowed by the recent downturn and could lead to significant gains in the coming weeks. Many experts have pointed out three emerging players—Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20), Slothana ($SLOTH), and Sponge V2 ($SPONGE), suggesting they could see gains in the 100-150x range. Let’s dig into the specifics and discover exactly what they bring to the table. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet the Best Presale Coin Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Bitcoin Going Through Big Price Changes Ahead of Halving – But No Matter How It Performs, These Three New Tokens Are Prime for a Bull Run Bitcoin (BTC) recently surged past $72,000 ahead of the upcoming reward halving event scheduled for April 20th. This price increase provided a boost to some projects, while the broader crypto market remained relatively stable. Bitcoin rose 8% over the past two weeks, reaching its highest level since March 14th. Typically, Bitcoin has seen price rallies after the halving events rather than before them, making this pre-halving rally unusual. The halving refers to when the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks gets cut in half. Currently, miners receive 6.25 BTC per block mined. After the halving, that reward will drop to 3.125 BTC per block. Reducing the mining rewards slows the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation. Historically, these supply shocks from halving events have preceded bull markets for Bitcoin, as reduced supply puts upward pressure on prices. Open interest in Bitcoin futures hit record highs above $25 billion recently, suggesting that many investors are gearing up for big changes in the market caused by the halving event. While some analysts think this rally could continue towards $100,000, others view it as unsustainable and expect a “sell-the-news” event after the halving. Regardless of Bitcoin’s moves, a few smaller crypto projects positioned themselves to outperform the larger players and bring significant gains — Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20), Slothana ($SLOTH), and Sponge V2 ($SPONGE). \u003e\u003e\u003eGet the Best Presale Coin Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) Gears Up for Launch – A New Eco-Friendly Crypto with $10M in Early Investment Set for Significant Growth Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) is a new crypto project inspired by the popular meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE). It is set to launch on the upcoming Doge Day, April 20th. Compared to many established cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin20 will have a relatively small initial market capitalization. A lower starting market cap could potentially allow early investors to see larger percentage gains when the project grows over time. The $DOGE20 presale has already raised over $10 million from investors attracted by its environmentally-friendly proof-of-stake model and staking rewards. However, the presale period is closing soon and will end on Doge Day. A key feature is the ability for token holders to earn staking rewards, generating a passive income stream by holding their $DOGE20 tokens in a crypto wallet. The projected annual staking reward rate is 52% for the first couple years after launch, providing additional motivation for early adoption. Unlike cryptos using energy-intensive proof-of-work mining, Dogecoin20 is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum using a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This is designed to reduce the environmental impact by removing the need for power-hungry mining rigs. As environmental sustainability grows in importance, $DOGE20’s eco-friendly consensus model could appeal to conscious crypto investors. Combined with its staking rewards and low initial market cap, it aims to attract investors seeking potential for major profit. The current Dogecoin20 presale price is just $0.00022 per token, establishing a relatively low entry point before the upcoming launch and price surge. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet Dogecoin20 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Slothana ($SLOTH) Surges on Solana – $10M Presale Success as Investors Rush to Secure Their Tokens Slothana ($SLOTH) is a new crypto project built on the Solana blockchain that has rapidly raised over $10 million in its presale. This significant early fundraising highlights Slothana’s arrival as a notable new player within the Solana ecosystem. Many crypto projects are now building on Solana instead of Ethereum due to Solana’s faster transaction speeds and greater scaling potential. $SLOTH’s choice to use Solana’s blockchain aligns with this emerging trend of exploring alternatives to Ethereum. One unique aspect of $SLOTH is its simplified presale investment process. Rather than having multiple rounds, investors can directly exchange their SOL tokens for $SLOTH tokens at a fixed rate of 10,000 $SLOTH per SOL. This streamlined approach avoids the complexities often seen in other crypto presales. There are certain rumors that Slothana’s team may also be responsible for Smog ($SMOG), a previous Solana project that delivered 30x gains for early investors. While speculative, this potential connection has generated buzz around $SLOTH. The timing of $SLOTH’s launch matches with the annual “Doge Day” celebrating Dogecoin and meme coins, likely boosting its initial popularity among investors interested in meme-themed crypto projects. Moving forward. $SLOTH aims to build on its successful presale fundraising and rapidly growing community interest. However, the presale window is closing soon, so investors looking to participate should act quickly before the opportunity passes. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet Slothana Now\u003c\u003c\u003c SPONGE V2 ($SPONGE) — New Play-to-Earn Game and Attractive Staking Rewards Bring Potential for Major Gains SPONGE V2 ($SPONGE) is an updated version of the original $SPONGE meme crypto token. The previous $SPONGE token achieved significant success, reaching a market capitalization of $100 million and providing early investors with 100x returns on their investment. One of the new features introduced in $SPONGE V2 is a Play-to-Earn game inspired by the popular SpongeBob SquarePants animated series. This game element aims to increase user engagement and interaction with the project’s meme-based theme. As an incentive for long-term holders, investors who lock up their original Sponge V1 tokens for an extended period will receive four years’ worth of staking rewards in the form of $SPONGE V2 tokens. This reward system is designed to reward early adoption and encourage long-term participation. The process for transitioning from the original $SPONGE token to Sponge V2 involves a “bridging” mechanism detailed in the project’s whitepaper, allowing V1 token holders to migrate their holdings to the new V2 version. The upcoming $SPONGE V2 token sale presents an investment opportunity with clear incentives such as staking rewards. Given the original $SPONGE token’s success in achieving a 100x price increase, some investors may view Sponge V2 as having potential for similar gains in the meme coin market segment. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet Sponge V2 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Conclusion With the BTC halving on the horizon, Bitcoin has seen significant price changes recently, but ultimately returned to over $72,000. Market uncertainty has investors searching for new opportunities, looking for tokens that weren’t slowed down by the recent downturn in the market. Numerous experts are recommending these three new meme coins as prime candidates for significant growth and explosive performance in the weeks ahead — Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20), Slothana ($SLOTH), and Sponge V2 ($SPONGE). The interest in their presales indicates their potential for significant returns, with predictions suggesting possible gains in the 100-150x range.

    "content": "With Bitcoin ripping higher and closing in on breaking all-time highs, one analyst on X thinks $150,000 post-halving is “programmed.” The analyst remains upbeat in a post, highlighting several fundamental developments that could drive the world’s most valuable coin to new valuation and more than 2X from spot rates. Currently, the path of least resistance remains northward. Buyers have shaken off the bears of the past trading month, finding anchor from the March 20 bull bar. On April 8, the coin soared above the key liquidation level at around $71,800. Bitcoin has since cooled off, but the leg up remains, and it may form the basis of another breakout above $74,000. Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView For bulls to be firmly in control and align with the analyst’s outlook, there should be a follow-through of the April 8 surge, ideally with rising trading volumes. This could catalyze demand, even placing Bitcoin above $74,000 and fresh 2024 highs before the highly anticipated Halving event. Eyes On Bitcoin Halving: A Supply Squeeze In The Making? As the analyst explains, the “Halving” event is a crucial catalyst for this potential surge. Less than ten days away, this event is a protocol-driven occurrence that will see the network reduce block rewards to 3.125 BTC, down from the current 6.25 BTC. Related Reading: Filecoin Bull Run On The Horizon? Analyst Sees 250% Surge This reduction, combined with sustained demand, will likely create a scarcity of Bitcoin, potentially driving up its price. Bitcoin halving countdown | Source: Coinwarz Ahead of Bitcoin’s Halving, the analyst said the amount of BTC held by exchanges is dwindling. To illustrate, Coinbase’s holdings stand at a six-year low. However, this is not an isolated event; data shows that major exchanges like Binance are seeing decreasing supply. At the same time, over-the-counter (OTC) desks, which handle large, private cryptocurrency transactions, are reportedly running low on Bitcoin, indicating strong institutional demand. This suggests a potential supply squeeze set to only worsen in the coming months. Impact Of Spot BTC ETFs: London, Hong Kong In The Picture Already, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) issuers, the analyst added, are on a buying spree, gobbling up over $300 million of BTC every day. Since these issuers are acting on behalf of investors, both retail and institutions, they are actively infusing capital into the market, a huge boost for prices. It should be noted that the surge from Q4 2023 to early January was primarily because of the anticipated spot Bitcoin ETFs. The spillover effect and the billions flowing into the asset make BTC more liquid and resilient against aggressive sellers. Spot BTC ETF tracker | Source: Lookonchain on X Additionally, the London Stock Exchange plans to list exchange-traded notes (ETNs) backed by Bitcoin in Q2 2024. Like the spot ETFs in the United States, this product will inject liquidity into the market and legitimize the coin as a worthy asset class, similar to gold.

    "content": "The Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross indicator attained overheated values coinciding with the recent local top in the price. Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Surged To 3.17 During Recent Peak An analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained that the NVT Golden Cross may have served as an indicator of the recent top in cryptocurrency prices. The “NVT” refers to an on-chain metric that tracks the ratio between Bitcoin’s market cap and transaction volume (both in USD). This ratio is generally used to determine whether the asset’s price is fair or not. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Capitulate: $5.2 Billion Sold At Loss When the indicator has a high value, the asset’s price (the market cap) is high compared to its utility (the transaction volume). Such a trend may suggest that the coin could be overvalued currently. On the other hand, the low metric could suggest the network isn’t valued fairly compared to its high ability to transact capital, and as such, its price may be due to an uplift. In the context of the current discussion, the NVT itself isn’t interesting, but rather, a modified version called the NVT Golden Cross is. This metric compares the short-term trend of the NVT (10-day moving average) against its long-term trend (30-day MA). Like the NVT, this variant is also used to estimate the fairness of the asset. Historically, values greater than 2.2 have been a signal that BTC is overheated, as the short-term trend is notably outpacing the long-term at these levels. Similarly, values under the -1.6 level may indicate that the cryptocurrency is undervalued; hence, its price may likely form a bottom and find a rebound soon. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross rose to relatively high levels earlier. This growth happened as the asset’s price rallied towards the $71,000 level. The metric had touched the 3.17 mark in this surge, which suggests the coin may have become too overpriced. Indeed, the asset followed this by observing a sharp drawdown, which took it back under the $65,000 level. As the quant has marked in the chart, a similar pattern of the NVT Golden Cross hitting these high levels and resulting in a price correction was observed at different points over the last few years.

According to Tapiero, the observed correlation in the market points to concerns regarding “monetary debasement” fueled by a substantial increase in the Treasury market over the past five years. Tapiero’s bullish stance centers on the unique scarcity of Bitcoin as a digital asset, emphasizing its potential to outperform traditional assets like gold.

    "content": "Shiba Inu has achieved a significant milestone by surpassing 4 million addresses. This feat marks a historic moment for the token, symbolizing its growing popularity within the digital asset community. Analysis of address metrics on Glassnode reveals a steady uptrend in Shiba Inu’s address count over the past few months, culminating in this impressive milestone. Related Reading: Uniswap Bloodbath: UNI Price Crashes 16% On SEC Lawsuit Fears Address Growth Signals Potential, But Activity Paints A Different Picture While the increase in total addresses may initially appear promising, a closer examination of Shiba Inu’s activity metrics paints a contrasting picture. Despite the surge in address count, the number of active addresses has experienced a notable decline from previous highs. This discrepancy suggests that while there is a growing number of addresses associated with Shiba Inu, the level of actual activity within the network remains relatively low. Source: Glassnode Furthermore, the analysis of new addresses follows a similar downward trajectory, indicating a decrease in the rate of adoption or interest in the token. These trends raise questions about the sustainability of Shiba Inu’s growth and its ability to maintain momentum in the highly competitive cryptocurrency market. Shiba Inu Price Action Stagnates Amidst Uncertainty Against this backdrop of mixed signals, Shiba Inu’s price action has experienced a period of stagnation. Although there was a notable spike in price around March 5th, coinciding with increased address activity, the token has since struggled to maintain momentum. Currently trading around $0.000027, Shiba Inu’s price reflects a lack of clear directional bias, signaling uncertainty among investors and traders. Shiba Inu is now trading at $0.000027. Chart: TradingView Analysts attribute Shiba Inu’s stagnant price movements to a combination of factors, notably including prevailing sentiments across the cryptocurrency market and a lack of significant developments specific to the token. Despite its widespread recognition and community support, Shiba Inu’s valuation remains susceptible to external influences and market dynamics, indicative of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Related Reading: CEO Throws Cold Water On May Ethereum ETF Approval – Impact On Price While Shiba Inu enjoys a dedicated following, its price trajectory underscores the importance of monitoring both internal and external catalysts that could impact its valuation. Analysts caution investors to exercise prudence and recognize the nuanced relationship between Shiba Inu’s price and the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics. Trading Volume Indicates Stability Amidst Fluctuations Meanwhile, in addition to price action, the trading volume for Shiba Inu has remained relatively stable in recent times. With trading activity hovering around $527 million, there have been no significant spikes or declines observed in the near term. This stability suggests that while the overall market sentiment may be uncertain, there is still a consistent level of interest and participation in Shiba Inu trading activities.

    "content": "Following an extended period of stasis, the price of XRP has suddenly begun to rise, fueling several bullish predictions regarding the altcoin’s direction from several cryptocurrency analysts. Bullish Timelines For XRP The most current positive forecasts came from cryptocurrency expert and XRP enthusiast BarriC, who has established multiple timelines for the digital asset to rise to unprecedented heights in the long term. Taking to the X (formerly Twiter) platform, BarriC voiced his opinions, noting that as time goes on, crypto investors might have fewer chances to purchase cheap XRP. According to the analyst, inexpensive XRP today is defined as less than $0.80. Related Reading: Analysts Say XRP Price Is Ready To Breakout, Here Are The Targets Furthermore, the expert underscored his prediction that XRP would trade between $1 and $3. BarriC specifically contended that by the time this bull market ends, a cheap XRP would be between the aforementioned price levels. Moving on, BarriC has regarded the crypto asset as undervalued between the $10 and $15 threshold in the next 4 to 5 years, particularly around the subsequent Bitcoin halving event and bull cycle between 2028 and 2029. If, toward the conclusion of the next bull run, XRP is cheap, trading between $10 and $15, then the analyst is expecting it to reach much higher prices at the peak of the bull cycle. BarriC envisions a significant surge from the anticipated $10 to a triple-digit landmark. Following the succeeding halving and bull cycle, which is expected to occur by 2032 and 2033, the analyst expects the token to also be undervalued at $100 and $500. Concluding his forecast, he affirms that market participants will always have access to affordable prices. However, it is up to those interested in the altcoin to decide how much funds they are willing to invest. $1,000 Is Possible In The Long Run It is worth noting that the analyst previously projected a $1,000 price mark for XRP. According to BarriC, XRP’s path over the coming several months and years promises to be exciting. He believes XRP’s price will rise as the cryptocurrency market expands and changes, and as a result, it will be poised for massive growth and more widespread adoption.

Other prices set aside by the expert to watch out for include $1, $5, $10, $50, $100, and $500. Whether in the short term or long term, BarriC is confident the token will change people’s lives.

    "content": "With so many different casino sites now available to pick and choose from, finding the right one can be overwhelming. Thankfully, there are a few things that players can keep an eye on when looking for a new one to consider, with those who like to use cryptocurrency also now able to find some of their own advantages that may not be possible to experience with some of the more traditional sites that are in the market. Cryptocurrency has boomed in recent years and has become a preferred option for players worldwide. Although many may associate virtual currency with the peaks and troughs that can be experienced in terms of its price, value and the volatility that can be witnessed, those who have a little detailed knowledge about the wider benefits that can be enjoyed have started to understand just how advantageous they can be when applied to casino gaming. As a result, finding the right casino site has become even more important than ever for all types of players, regardless of the payment method that they prefer to use. While this is a vital aspect that needs to be considered, it’s also worth recognizing that sites can offer differences in terms of the overall security offered, the collection of games and types that build their portfolios, as well as the bonuses and promotions that might be offered to entice an individual to join them over another site that is available. Look at reviews and consider previous feedback The very first port of call for any player who is looking to find the right online casino and enjoy a positive experience should be to look at any reviews that have been left by their peers or experts across the iGaming industry. Reviews left by these individuals can typically be trusted as they will usually want others to know about their own personal experiences and give an insight into what can be expected. They are not being incentivized to leave positive remarks, and where they deem things are not quite right, they aren’t usually afraid to share their criticisms. Additionally, reviews can be a great way to gauge an overview of what to expect, as multiple reviews suggesting the same thing can be taken as a good yardstick. Security features and licenses need to be considered Cryptocurrency’s boom as a popular form of payment for casino gaming arguably stems from the security features that it contains. Compared to traditional fiat currency, there are so many more advantages and benefits that can be obtained, through the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts. These technologies encrypt the transaction from start to end, but they make it transparent and keep the users of the transaction anonymous. Virtual currency can also be used to create provably fair gaming, which means players can ensure the games that are being offered are not rigged, as their randomness can be checked. In terms of security, aside from using crypto, players should identify the security measures that are in place. A good place to start would be to check the type of gambling license that is offered. This will be a good indicator of what protocols are in place, as they require certain standards to be met. Elsewhere, it’s important to look at the security features that can be easily spotted, such as the encryption technologies that may be used on each web page visited (the padlock in the URL address bar), as well as those used when making a financial transaction or the security measures that are needed when logging in. Games being offered The best casino sites will offer thousands upon thousands of games to pick and choose from. Before signing up, a prospective player should look at the library that is offered and go through each of the categories to determine whether it is right for their gaming experiences. In doing so, you’ll know what to expect as you’ll be able to see which software providers are on board, as well as the quantities of game types. For instance, if you have a preference for high-paying slot games, then you may want to check out whether Megaways or Jackpot titles are available. If there are, it would be a good idea to know how many, as this can help to prolong and increase the experiences that are obtained from the chosen site. For crypto players, it’s worth taking a look at whether Crash games are available, in addition to traditional casino games that allow crypto payments, including the use of altcoins, as these will further enhance any experience. Looking at bonuses and promotions Everyone wants to get as much as they can for their money to improve satisfaction with their spend, and the best way to achieve this with casino gaming is to make the most of the bonuses and promotions that are offered. These can be the main way in which casinos diversify themselves and separate from the crowded pack. Players should do as much research regarding each bonus being offered (looking at T\u0026Cs, etc.) and determine what they want to experience. Not all bonuses are the same, but they can each have a significant impact on how a casino is enjoyed. A lot about finding the right casino can be about the benefits that can be enjoyed. Final Thoughts There are so many different things that need to be considered when trying to find the right casino site, especially as there are so many available to choose from. If you want to use cryptocurrency, then there are some things that need to be thought of specifically, but many of those also apply to those using fiat currencies.

    "content": "On-chain data shows Bitcoin has been going through a “euphoria wave” for two months. Here’s how long it was in this phase during the last bull run. Bitcoin Has Been In Euphoria Wave Phase According To Supply In Profit According to the latest weekly report from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the current BTC cycle is similar to the last one regarding the “Supply Profitability State.” This indicator is based on the “Percent Supply in Profit,” which keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that’s currently carrying a profit. Related Reading: Dogecoin Slows Down: What Needs To Happen For New DOGE Highs? This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see the price at which it was last transferred. Assuming that this last transaction was the last point at which it changed hands, the price at its time would reflect the coin’s current cost basis. Naturally, if this cost basis is lower in value than the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, then the coin in question carries some net unrealized gain. The Percent Supply in Profit adds up all such coins and calculates what percentage of the supply they make up for. The supply Profitability State signals BTC’s current phase based on the market’s profitability status. The chart below shows the trend in this indicator over the past few years. Looks like the metric has been giving a green signal in recent weeks | Source: Glassnode\u0027s The Week Onchain - Week 15, 2024 In the chart, the analytics firm has highlighted three important lines for the Bitcoin Percent Supply in Profit. The middle line (colored in blue) represents the cumulative mean of the metric, while the other two signify +1 (green) and -1 (red) standard deviation (SD) from this mean. When the Bitcoin Percent Supply in Profit is above the +1SD (approximately 95% of the supply being in the green), the market may be considered to be in the euphoria or pre-euphoria phase. Similarly, the Supply Profitability State would indicate a bottom discovery phase for values less than -1SD. The zone between these two corresponds to the “bear/bull transition” phase. From the chart, it’s visible that during the last bull run, Bitcoin first saw a 1.5-month-long pre-euphoria wave, during which the metric tested the +1SD line. The asset followed up with a period of decline and consolidation, which put the Supply In Profit back under the +1 SD mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Two Important On-Chain Levels: What Happened Last Time Finally, the coin observed a sharp rally, broke past the +1SD barrier, and went on to achieve new all-time highs, which naturally set the Supply In Profit to 100%. Bitcoin seems to have witnessed a similar pattern this time around. A two-month-long pre-euphoria phase was followed by a drawdown, which has now been succeeded by a two-month-long euphoria wave during which the cryptocurrency has achieved new records. If the euphoria wave lasts for a period similar to the last bull run, then four or more months might still be left for this Bitcoin bull rally. BTC Price Bitcoin had recovered above $72,000 earlier, but it appears that the asset has retraced back towards the $69,400 level.

    "content": "The Bitcoin Halving is almost here, bringing about the most significant event in the Cryptocurrency market ever. Each event has had a dramatic impact on supply, demand, and price appreciation post-halving. But with Bitcoin price already setting a new all-time high before the halving for the first time ever, how might this change post-halving performance? Let’s take a closer look. What is the Bitcoin Halving? The Bitcoin Halving is a recurring event happening approximately every four years. By design, it is intended to increase the scarcity of BTC and strengthen the security of the network. However, it has the unintended effect of bringing more participants, speculation, and volatility to Crypto markets, driving Bitcoin price to astronomical new highs. Currently, miners unlock about 900 new BTC each day while contributing to the security of the Bitcoin network. After the next halving, this will be reduced to roughly 450 new BTC each day. This abrupt change in supply, coupled with growing demand is often an event worth paying attention to, as the following data will reveal. Past post-halving performance examined The first ever Bitcoin halving occurred on November 28, 2012. BTCUSD traded at around $10. Within one year, Bitcoin price climbed by nearly 10,000% to over $1,200 per coin. At this point, the top Cryptocurrency was still in its infancy, and few paid attention to the impact the halving had on price action. The second halving took place on July 9, 2016, some four years later. Cryptocurrencies were still relatively unknown at this point in time. However, new altcoins were starting to gain traction and the industry surrounding Bitcoin begane to develop. 16 months later, BTCUSD rallied from $570 at the July 2016 halving to just under $20,000 per coin, representing a 3,400% post-halving performance. By the third halving, which took place on May 11, 2020, the world had started to realise the correlation between BTCUSD performance and the proximity to the halving event. The halving happened just months following the COVID pandemic and unprecedented money supply expansion, resulting in a perfect storm for Bitcoin and investors. Within a year, Bitcoin soared from under $9,000 per coin to more than $65,000 per BTC. Although this is substantial in USD terms, this was only a 625% gain compared to 3,400% and 10,000% previously, setting the precedence for diminishing returns. Why the 2024 Bitcoin Halving could be different The Bitcoin Halving in 2024 is pegged for mid-April, and is already gearing up to be the most important event in Crypto history. While the phrase “this time is different” is considered the most dangerous in investing, this time, when it comes to Bitcoin, things are very different to the past. Despite the enormous bull markets that follow each halving, none of these rallies set a new all-time high beforehand. In 2024, Bitcoin has already set a new all-time high, which could either mean further diminishing performance, or a shocking rally that surprises the masses and only adds to the price tag of each BTC further. With each Bitcoin Halving, the market participants increasingly took note of its powerful impact on price appreciation. The halving is a publicly known event, and in 2024, the post-halving performance could have been front-run by so-called smart money, whales, and institutional investors, who are aware of the type of gains that are possible. Whether or not this means less performance post-halving remains to be seen. However, the reduction in new BTC available to miners should still impact the delicate balance of supply versus demand in favour of more price appreciation ahead after the event. Factors fuelling increased profit potential in Crypto The emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States are one of the major factors causing the new price record ahead of the halving, and could further ignite a bull market post halving. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been absorbing as much as 10 times the new supply from miners, and post halving this could increase to 20 times the new available supply if ETF demand remains consistent. Combined with demand from retail investors hearing about the halving in the media and in social circles, price could still rise substantially, even though Bitcoin is currently trading above former all-time highs from 2021 at $68,000 per coin.

If there is a move above the $3,880 resistance, Ethereum could even rise toward the $4,000 resistance. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,600 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,520 level. The first major support is near the $3,500 zone. The next key support could be the $3,400 zone. A clear move below the $3,400 support might send the price toward $3,320. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,240 level.

This has no doubt caused concerns in the XRP community, considering the impact that the derivatives market has on a crypto’s price. $1.32 Million XRP Positions Get Liquidated Data from Coinglass shows that $1.32 million has been liquidated from the XRP market in the last 24 hours. Long positions account for a majority of these liquidations, with $1.04 million in long positions being wiped out during this period.

For instance, the total trading volume and open interest have dropped by 36.90% and 2.69%, respectively, which suggests that crypto investors are choosing to stay out of the XRP market. Meanwhile, there has also been a decline in the options volume, further suggesting that crypto investors have reduced their bets on the the altcoin. This is, however, not surprising considering how XRP has maintained a tepid price action despite the broader crypto market enjoying significant price gains at different times. Despite XRP’s current market conditions, there are still those betting heavily on a bullish future trajectory for the crypto token. This includes crypto expert Zach Rector, who has stated that the altcoin will “not miss the bull run” despite its current price action. He alluded to XRP’s fundamentals as one reason for his belief. More recently, he mentioned that XRP will soon experience a supply shock with increased token burns on the horizon. These token burns help reduce the number of tokens in circulation and can help drive up the token’s value through scarcity. Time To Accumulate More Tokens Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto recently mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that it was time to accumulate more XRP. He made this statement while highlighting an ascending triangle on XRP’s monthly timeframe, which “screams bullish.” In anticipation of this bullish move, the analyst urged crypto investors to “accumulate more, and then just sit back and wait for the magic to happen.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Drops Trading Strategy To Profit Off Shiba Inu’s Next Leg Up Above $0.00003 As to how high XRP could rise, Egrag stated that “the measured move of the Ascending Triangle could potentially reach either $17 or $27.” The analyst had also recently claimed that the altcoin would rise to $5 by July. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.6, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "content": "The better-than-expected United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) released on April 10 is already sending shock waves through the financial market. Bitcoin and most crypto assets are trading lower, extending losses recorded on April 9, weighing negatively against optimists. United States CPI Data Came In Hot According to Trading Economics data on April 10, CPI, a key economic metric for gauging inflation, rose 0.4% in March, pushing the annual inflation rate to 3.5%. Notably, this surpassed economist predictions and, most importantly, dashed hopes for the United States Federal Reserve (Fed) to slash rates aggressively this year. United States CPI data | Source: Trading Economics However, amidst the market jitters, Matt Hougan, the CIO of Bitwise Asset Management, offered a contrarian perspective as fear permeated the Bitcoin and crypto market. In a post on X, Hougan downplayed the influence of the CPI data on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Related Reading: XRP Heading To $100-$500? Analyst Provides Speculated Timeframes The executive argues that investors and traders should track other market factors like spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows and rising government deficits. In Hougan’s assessment, these can strongly influence price, even lifting Bitcoin higher since they are currently aligned. Time To Buy The Bitcoin Dip? As such, even with the fall in BTC, the drop could offer potential buying opportunities for long-term holders. Some supporters believe the “hot” CPI data only exposes the vulnerabilities of fiat currencies. This would potentially drive investors to use Bitcoin as a hedge. Moreover, this upbeat sentiment is backed by solid demand for gold, a store of value asset preferred by traditional finance investors. Analysts anticipate Bitcoin will follow a similar path as investors seek to protect value amid rising inflation. Further bolstering the bullish sentiment is the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF launch in Hong Kong before the end of April. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has been assessing various applications. Leading Chinese asset managers have submitted some. If the product is approved, it could further channel more capital to BTC, boosting inflows from the United States.

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has shown an impressive performance in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, as highlighted in a recent report by market intelligence data research firm Messari. The research firm finds key factors contributing to Bitcoin’s price increase, market cap dominance, and the emergence of new trends in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Inscription Activities Drive Bitcoin Fees Up Analyzing the key figures detailed in the report, Bitcoin’s price experienced a significant increase in Q1 2024, rising 68.78% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to reach an all-time high (ATH) of $73,100. This price increase propelled Bitcoin’s market cap dominance to 49.7% in March 2024. Interestingly, the research firm notes that such dominance is a typical feature at the start of a new halving cycle, with Bitcoin often leading the way for other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: XRP Price Drops After Massive Whale Dump, Casting Doubt On $1 Target In April BTC’s price increase QoQ. Source: Messari Another relevant figure is the inscription activity in Q4 2023, which drove fees up by 699.4% QoQ. However, in Q1 2024, subscription-related fees decreased by 41.9%. Despite declining total fees, inscription-related transactions still accounted for 18.4% of Bitcoin’s total fees, demonstrating their continued relevance. Average daily transactions and daily active addresses also experienced a decline of 15.3% and 4.7% QoQ, respectively. The report suggests that the decline in transaction activity may be attributed to decreased activity from bots or “super users.” This shift aligns with the decrease in inscription-related activities and fees. Inscription-related activity initially surged in February 2023, leading to a considerable transaction increase. Although Q1 2024 witnessed a decline in inscription-related activity QoQ, it remained significantly higher year-over-year (YoY), indicating its continued impact on the network. ETFs Amassed 212,000 BTC In Q1 Messari highlights that Q1 2024 showed the growth of programmable layers in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Established layers such as Rootstock and Stacks led the way regarding total value locked (TVL), while newer layers such as BOB and Merlin experienced rapid growth. TVL’s 127% QoQ growth was primarily in non-BTC assets, as Bitcoin-locked amounts lagged behind the Lightning Network and alt-L1 networks, which host significant amounts of BTC. Ultimately, the approval and launch of nine spot ETFs and one ETF conversion marked a significant milestone for Bitcoin’s legitimization by the US government and traditional finance (TradFi). The report notes that these ETFs garnered over $12 billion in inflows within the first month. Notably, BTC ETFs surpassed silver ETFs in assets under management (AUM) but still lagged behind gold ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs inflows during the first three months of trading. Source: Messari Institutional BTC holdings were also surpassed by MicroStrategy, the largest institutional holder, with 215,000 BTC. The ETFs accumulated 212,000 BTC in inflows during Q1, further establishing Bitcoin’s prominence in the financial markets.

    "content": "Crypto experts continue to be bullish on the XRP price despite the poor performance that the altcoin has exhibited in recent times. Some of these experts see the cryptocurrency’s price rising higher from its current level, with one analyst expecting XRP to rise as high as $20 in the coming bull market. XRP Price On The Verge Of Breakout One of the crypto experts that has shown incredibly bullish sentiment toward the XRP price is Matthew Dixon, the CEO of crypto rating platform, Evai. Dixon took to X (formerly Twitter) to share with the crypto community that the XRP trading volume had been seeing positive headwinds in recent times. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Warns Of Burgeoning Bitcoin Fire Sale, Here’s What It Means At the time, the Evai chart shared by the the crypto CEO showed that XRP had recorded an approximately 42% increase in its daily trading volume to cross $2.1 billion. Using this increase in trading volume, Dixon believes that it shows the rising interest in the altcoin. Naturally, increased interest often translates to increased demand, which can be bullish for a cryptocurrency’s price. This was the thought shared by the Evai CEO who believed the surge in trading volume and interest meant that the XRP price was on the verge of a breakout. However, this does not seem to be the case, at least in the short term, since the XRP price continues to trend around the same level since Dixon first made the post. It is hovering around $0.61 at the time of this writing, with a0.96% gain in the last 24 hours. Can Price Get To $20? Predictions for the XRP price going into the next bull market have had a wide variety, from very conservative to very ambitious. For many, though, the expectation is that the XRP price will rise very quickly as regulatory clarity from the Ripple vs SEC case is fast approaching. Crypto analyst Armando Patoja takes the ambitious route with his own prediction, forecasting an over 3,000% price increase for XRP. According to Patoja, the predictions that put XRP’s future price at $5 severely underestimate the ability of the altcoin. On his own, the crypto analyst believes that the XRP price has the potential to rise even further to reach between $10 to $20. Patoja posits that saying XRP will reach just $5 is like expecting Bitcoin to top out at $1,000 in 2015. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Bullish Reversal In On-Chain Metrics, Can SHIB Price Recover? There people saying #XRP will reach $5 are significantly underestimating. This is similar to predicting #Bitcoin would cap at $1,000 in 2015.

Thoughts? — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) April 6, 2024 Despite the growing XRP community, it is no doubt that Patoja’s prediction has been received with a grain of salt. One community member responded to the post saying XRP could not possibly rise that high because major projects who were building on the XRP Ledger have been abandoning it for other chains because it is a dead chain. Due to the lack of builders, they do not believe that XRP has the steam to run that high.

    "content": "The digital currency world is buzzing with some serious drama and exciting developments. From Tron taking on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a landmark legal battle to Borroe Finance ($ROE) gearing up for a massive expansion, there’s plenty to unpack in today’s crypto narrative. \u003e\u003eBUY $ROE TOKENS NOW\u003c\u003c Tron Strikes Back: A Legal Showdown with the SEC Tron, a major player in the blockchain arena, has thrown down the gauntlet in a New York federal court. At the heart of this legal drama? The SEC’s allegations that Tron’s digital assets, TRX and BTT, were involved in unregistered securities activities. But Tron isn’t just standing by—no, they’re challenging the SEC’s claims head-on. Tron’s lawyers are swinging hard with arguments that the SEC is out of bounds, trying to enforce U.S. securities laws on what they claim are “foreign defendants.” They’re making a bold statement: these token sales don’t meet the traditional criteria that define securities, specifically under the Howey Test. Tron’s defense hinges on the detail that their ICO (Initial Coin Offering) for TRX and BTT’s IEO (Initial Exchange Offering) didn’t directly target U.S. persons or accounts, positioning them outside the SEC’s regulatory grasp. This point might just be their ace in the hole as they push back against the SEC’s expansive reach.

Because Borroe Finance’s $ROE tokens are priced to sell at just $0.020, offering an attractive entry point into this promising platform. \u003e\u003eBUY $ROE TOKENS NOW\u003c\u003c Why Invest in $ROE?

The analyst said that historically, when Bitcoin closes two consecutive months above the upper Bollinger Band on the monthly chart, prices tend to double within three months. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin will surge to over $140,000 by July 2024, just three months after the Bitcoin halving event. Related Reading: Forget Bitcoin!

At press time, the coin is changing hands above $71,800, convincingly breaking above the liquidation level of around $72,000. Bitcoin price trending upwards on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView Despite the bullish breakout, whether the uptrend continues remains to be seen. Of note is that BTC prices tend to collapse before the Halving, which is set to take place in the coming weeks, dumping to as low as 20%. BTC fell after peaking at $73,800, dropping to around the $60,000 level before snapping back higher to current levels. A refreshing close above $74,000 might form the basis of even more gains in the days ahead, perhaps towards $100,000 in the weeks ahead. BTC might breakout | Source: Analyst on X Another analyst suggests that Bitcoin could rally to $140,000 within four weeks, especially if it follows a similar price pattern to December 2020. After breaking above the $20,000 high of 2017, Bitcoin continued to rally, peaking at around $70,000 for a nearly 3X surge. Currently, buyers are eyeing the $74,000 mark and the all-time high. If this level is surpassed, as it was in late 2020, the possibility of Bitcoin at least doubling to $140,000 becomes more likely. Will Halving, Macroeconomic Factors, And Spot ETFs Drive Prices? The current bullish sentiment might continue. Possible drivers include interest in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). So far, billions have been channeled to these products, lifting demand and thus prices. The upcoming Halving event could further buoy demand, lifting prices even higher in the coming months. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Makes Bold Prediction For Crypto Market – $5 Trillion In 2024 Beyond Bitcoin-driven fundamentals, analysts are also looking at market events, especially in the United States. Some speculate that the United States Federal Reserve (Fed) might not slash interest by at least three times this year as labor conditions become firm and inflation slows down. If the Fed reduces interest rates, reversing their hawkish outlook, BTC could lead other safe havens in an uptrend.

    "content": "Crypto analyst Kamaz recently dropped a bullish trajectory analysis regarding Shiba Inu on its journey to reaching above the $0.00003 mark again. In his latest update, Kamaz noted three bullish price targets for SHIB in a long position after noting a potential market upswing. Interestingly, this bullish prediction comes amidst a wider market uncertainty and with Shiba Inu registering a bullish reversal in on-chain metrics. Analyst Drops Bullish Trading Strategy Kamaz’s analysis is based on a 4-hour chart timeframe which he shared on social media. At the time of analysis, SHIB was trading at $0.00002883 and recent candle formation shows the bulls trying to reverse the formation of bearish candles which has already lasted for 24 hours at this point. Related Reading: Solana Open Interest Drops $370 Million Amid Network Troubles, $200 Still Possible? The analyst recommended opening a long position, with three consecutive targets materializing by April 12. The earliest target is just above $0.0003. Particularly, this target coincides with the low of the last candle formation on March 31. If Shiba Inu can break through the $0.00003 resistance level and hold steady above it, this puts Kamaz’s next target just below $0.0000315, which also coincides with the March 21 high of $0.000031336. Kamaz’s final SHIB target is at $0.000032930, the crypto’s highest on March 28, representing a 14% increase from the current price level. This small profit potential for reaching the final target makes it interesting to note that Kamaz’s prediction is of a short-term price outlook. SHIB has, in fact, gone past these price targets in the current bull cycle to reach as high as $0.000044 on March 5. However, the crypto has since corrected over 20% from this peak. Cryptocurrencies are volatile, so Kamaz’s analysis came with setting a firm stop loss at $0.00002810 to avoid getting caught in a reversal. Current Shiba Inu Outlook According to Kamaz, his analysis was based on various reasons ranging from SHIB turning resistance to support, inside 1-day bullish order block, and inside discount, among others. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Warns Of Burgeoning Bitcoin Fire Sale, Here’s What It Means On-chain metrics are also pointing to a bullish reversal for SHIB in the near future. These metrics include increased accumulation from whales and a meteoric surge in SHIB burns. Fundamentals and constant updates from the Shiba Inu team also point to a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. One of these is the recent update for Shiba Eternity, Shiba Inu’s collectible card game. According to crypto analyst Armando Patonja, SHIB is on the verge of breaking out of a triangular formation, which could see it surging to the $0.000048 price for the second time this year. Once Shiba Inu breaks $0.000048, the next target is $0.0006, over 100% higher than today’s price.

This movement can be attributed to a risk-off sentiment among investors, largely in anticipation of the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures today.

Despite the magnitude of this news, the immediate market reaction has been muted. Hong Kong To Launch Spot Bitcoin ETFs By End Of April According to a Tencent News report, Harvest International Asset Management and Huaxia Funds (Hong Kong) Limited have been officially approved to manage virtual assets, signaling their entry into the cryptocurrency sector in Hong Kong. This development is significant as it introduces mainland China’s leading public fund companies into Hong Kong’s virtual assets industry. Currently, there are 18 funds in Hong Kong authorized to manage cryptocurrency assets, with Harvest International and Huaxia Fund being among the first public funds to venture into this space. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Two Important On-Chain Levels: What Happened Last Time Harvest International emerged as the pioneer in submitting a proposal for a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong as of January 26. Following this initial submission, both companies have now secured the necessary qualifications to issue cryptocurrency-related fund products, including Bitcoin spot ETFs. This move enables retail investors to access these products through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The urgency to update the virtual asset management funds list stems from the SFC’s plan to unveil the first batch of Bitcoin spot ETFs by April 15. The initial batch was anticipated to include Huaxia Fund, Bosera Fund, and Value Partners Financial, alongside Harvest International. However, Bosera and Value Partners were notably absent from the updated list due to their lack of an independent responsible officer (RO) qualified in cryptocurrency asset management. These funds are reportedly collaborating with Hashkey Capital and VSFG, both qualified crypto asset management organizations.

Huaxia’s swift approval by the SFC, achieved in just two weeks, underscores the rapid pace of development in this area. The application process for a Bitcoin spot ETF in Hong Kong involves extensive collaboration with over 20 institutions, including custodian banks and market makers. Following the SFC’s approval, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is expected to spend approximately two weeks preparing for the ETF launch. Notably, this move opens up the crypto sector to Chinese retail investors, coming three months after the US SEC’s approval of the first batch of Bitcoin spot ETFs on January 11.

    "content": "The market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has pointed out what may need to happen before Dogecoin can continue its uptrend and reach new highs. Dogecoin Has Notable On-Chain Resistance Near $0.20 In a new post on X, IntoTheBlock has discussed the recent trend in the price of DOGE and what it would take for the memecoin to register a new high for the year. According to the analytics firm, Dogecoin must solidly break above the level where on-chain resistance is currently the strongest. In on-chain analysis, a level’s potential to act as resistance or support is based on the number of coins that were last bought at it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Two Important On-Chain Levels: What Happened Last Time Below is a chart that shows this investor cost basis distribution for DOGE at price ranges near the cryptocurrency’s current spot value. The distribution of tokens based on where they were last transacted on the blockchain | Source: IntoTheBlock on X Here, the size of the dot represents the number of coins acquired within the corresponding price range. In terms of the levels ahead, the prices around $0.20 have held the cost basis of the most number of tokens out of the ranges listed. To be more particular, about 32,000 addresses bought 3.78 billion DOGE around this mark. Since this price is above the current spot value of the asset, all of these investors would be holding at a loss. Generally, the cost basis is a special level for investors, and as such, they are prone to reacting when the asset retests. Investors holding at a loss may tend to show a selling reaction when such a reaction happens. This is because investors like these may fear that the cryptocurrency will dip again shortly, so exiting at the break-even mark might not sound like a bad idea, as they would at least be able to avoid any losses in the future. Of course, if only a few investors are involved, any such reaction from the market wouldn’t be relevant to the Dogecoin price. However, if a large number of investors show this reaction, the asset may very well feel some visible fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin 40% Of Way Through Bull Run If This Metric Is To Go By This is why the strength of an on-chain level’s ability to act as resistance or support lies in the number of coins acquired there. More coins mean a potentially larger reaction once the level is retested. As the $0.20 level holds the cost basis of a notable number of investors, it’s possible that it could act as a source of major resistance when Dogecoin retests it next. IntoTheBlock says that, for DOGE to continue its recent rend, it would have to break past this barrier solidly.

    "content": "In a recent analysis, Stanislas Bernard, the founder of Sinz 21st.Capital, delved into the complexities surrounding Hong Kong’s consideration to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs against the backdrop of China’s escalating economic crisis. With the nation grappling with a record debt-to-GDP ratio of 288% in 2023, and witnessing one of the most severe housing market collapses in three decades, the financial instability has triggered an unprecedented capital flight towards overseas markets. The Perfect Timing For A Spot Bitcoin ETF? Amidst these turbulent economic times, Hong Kong’s potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs stands out as a pivotal development that could not only be a safe haven for Chinese investors but also significantly influence Bitcoin’s valuation, potentially catapulting it to the elusive $100,000 mark. China’s economic woes have been intensifying, marked by a towering debt ratio and a plummeting housing sector that has investors scrambling for alternatives. “China currently faces a significant economic downturn, exacerbated by soaring debt and malinvestments in real estate. The crisis, becoming well-known in 2021 with the default of Evergrande Group, has now spread, causing a ripple effect that will likely slow down the Chinese economy for years to come,” Bernard pointed out. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Sub $70,000 As Hong Kong Readies April-End ETF Launch This backdrop of economic instability has incited a significant shift in investor behavior, notably among Chinese investors who, faced with stringent capital controls, have sought refuge in ETFs that offer exposure to foreign markets. Yet, this avenue has been fraught with its own challenges. “Investors are paying premiums as high as 43% on certain US-focused ETFs due to quota limitations, which speaks volumes about the desperation to find safer investment harbors,” Bernard notes. Such premiums underscore the pervasive fear and uncertainty that have gripped the Chinese market, driving investors towards seemingly any available exit from the volatility of the domestic market. The Role Of Hong Kong Bernard believes that not only Hong Kongers but also Chinese mainlanders will flock to Bitcoin ETFs. “They are pretty integrated. Mainland is HK’s largest trading partner. Would not be possible to approve a spot ETF and then close it to mainland. They will enforce transaction limits instead,” the expert said. In the midst of these developments, Hong Kong’ Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is reportedly considering the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs already by the end of April, as reported yesterday. This move is viewed as a strategic effort to capture a portion of the capital flowing into Bitcoin, especially in the wake of the SEC’s approval of similar ETFs in the US, which saw a meteoric rise with $12 billion of net flow. Related Reading: Bitcoin 2 Months Through “Euphoria Wave,” How Long Was The Last One? “Hong Kong is scrambling for a change. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs could unlock a vast reservoir of stranded Chinese capital into Bitcoin, providing a much-needed life raft for investors,” Bernard explained. The anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by Hong Kong authorities has been met with significant enthusiasm within the crypto community. Influential figures such as Bitcoin Munger and Stack Hodler have been vocal about the potential impact of this development on Bitcoin’s price. “Hong Kong ETFs approval have accelerated to next week. Most accounts on CT weren’t making a big deal about them, but they are a big deal. They are going to take us to $100k+ in due time. Tick tock!” stated popular Bitcoin analyst Bitcoin Munger (@bitcoinmunger). He refers to the regional yearly year-over-year supply change from West to East. Regional yearly year-over-year supply change | Source: X @bitcoinmunger Stack Hodler (@stackhodler) further emphasized the urgency among Chinese investors to find secure investment avenues outside the traditional system, “Chinese investors were panic-buying a Gold fund at a 30% premium this month as they attempt to get their wealth into something outside the Chinese system. The approval of Hong Kong spot ETFs could be the turning point, offering a sanctioned avenue for wealth preservation amidst the crumbling real estate market.” Overall, the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong is poised to be a landmark development, not just for the region but for the global market. By offering a secure and regulated channel for investment, it could serve as a catalyst for significant capital inflow into Bitcoin, reinforcing its status as a viable store of value. “As we stand at the cusp of this historic development, the implications for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market could be profound. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong could indeed be the harbinger of a new era, potentially driving Bitcoin’s value to new heights,” concluded Bernard. At press time, BTC traded at $70,945.

    "content": "In anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event, which is expected to occur later this month, Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel believes that the price impact may already be factored into the market to a certain extent. Thiel shared his insights in a recent interview with Bloomberg, in which he discussed the potential catalysts for further price increases and their implications for the mining industry. Related Reading: From Hat To Heights: Dogwifhat’s $17 Crypto Leap Electrifie Investors Bitcoin Halving Impact Mitigated By ETF Surge? The “halving” event, a software code update that occurs approximately every four years, is often regarded as a key driver of Bitcoin’s price appreciation. The update will reduce the block reward for miners by half, meaning they will receive fewer Bitcoins as a reward for validating transactions on the blockchain. However, Thiel noted that the impact of The Halving may not be as significant this time, as the recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has already attracted substantial capital to the market. Thiel explained: The ETF approval, which has been a huge success, has attracted capital into the market and essentially brought forward what could have been the price appreciation we typically would have seen three to six months post-halving. So I think we are seeing part of that now already and that has put forward some of the demand. While the halving event is expected to reduce the daily supply of new Bitcoins by approximately 450, Thiel believes the price impact may be relatively modest. However, the Marathon CEO expressed excitement about the positive price trend leading up to the halving, stating: As miners, we are very excited to go into a halving, where for once prices have not declined prior to the halving rather prices have gone up so everybody is obviously maximizing to that. Balancing ETF Inflows And Previous Halving Patterns Thiel’s observations come amidst the noteworthy inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, which have amassed nearly $12 billion in just three months of trading in the United States. While these inflows may have contributed to the current price appreciation, historical data reveals that Bitcoin still possesses considerable growth potential leading up to The Halving. To gain a comprehensive understanding, it is crucial to examine the recent surge in Bitcoin’s value, which has soared by nearly 370% from its bear market low of $15,400 to an all-time high (ATH) of $73,700 on March 14, 2024. In conjunction with this surge, past halving events provide valuable insights into Bitcoin’s price movements and the likelihood of surpassing the significant milestone of $100,000. During the first halving in November 2012, Bitcoin’s price experienced a remarkable surge from a low of $13 to a peak of $1,152 the following year, illustrating an impressive increase of 8,753%. Similarly, the second halving event in July 2016 witnessed Bitcoin’s price ascending from $664 to a new ATH of $17,760, reflecting a surge of 2,580% after the halving. The most recent Halving event in May 2020 saw Bitcoin’s price reach a significant milestone of $67,000, surging from a low of $9,730, which accounted for a substantial increase of 593% following the halving. Related Reading: Ethena (ENA) Is ‘The LUNA Of This Cycle’ With 20x Potential: Expert In perspective, while the potential scenario outlined by Thiel suggests that The Halving may be partially priced in due to the influence of ETF inflows, historical patterns suggest that Bitcoin still has plenty of room to run before the event. Several market pundits have also set their price targets for this bull run at the coveted $100,000 level in light of the upcoming halving event. However, it remains to be seen how the price of Bitcoin will react, taking into account factors such as the influx of capital through ETFs, historical data, and potential market dynamics. The daily chart shows that BTC’s price is trending downward. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Currently, BTC is trading at $68,400, down 0.4% from yesterday’s price.

    "content": "The recent volatility in the Bitcoin (BTC) price and its struggle to consolidate above the $70,000 mark has raised questions about the sustainability of its ongoing bull run. However, market expert Charles Edwards, co-founder of Capriole Invest, believes that the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Ethena Labs (ENA) could significantly extend and boost Bitcoin’s bull market to new heights. In a recent post on social media site X (formerly Twitter), Edwards suggested that Ethena’s actions, such as constraining over-leverage in derivatives markets and reducing spot supply, can propel Bitcoin’s price higher for a longer period. Bitcoin Bull Market Boost To provide further context as to why Edwards is suggesting this possibility, on April 4th, Ethena Labs announced its intention to engage in a cash-and-carry trade involving Bitcoin. According to the protocol’s announcement, Ethena Labs can manage risk and provide a more stable backing for its product by buying and shorting Bitcoin. Related Reading: Solana Open Interest Drops $370 Million Amid Network Troubles, $200 Still Possible? One of the key factors Edwards highlights is Ethena’s ability to constrain over-leverage in Bitcoin derivatives markets. By doing so, Ethena aims to prevent excessive risk-taking and potential market instability. Additionally, Ethena’s taking spot supply off the market can reduce selling pressure, thus supporting Bitcoin’s price and prolonging the bull market. The protocol also noted that Bitcoin derivative markets offer superior scalability and liquidity compared to Ethereum (ETH). This characteristic reportedly makes Bitcoin a suitable asset for delta hedging, a risk management strategy employed by Ethena. With $25 billion of Bitcoin open interest available for Ethena to delta hedge, the capacity for its synthetic dollar product, USDe, to scale has increased significantly. Ethena Labs noted in their announcement the following: In just 1 year, BTC open interest on major exchanges (exc. CME) has grown from $10bn to $25bn, while ETH OI has grown from $5 to $10bn BTC derivative markets are growing at a faster pace than ETH and offer better scalability and liquidity for delta hedging Weighing The Risks While Edwards’ statement is optimistic about Ethena’s impact on Bitcoin’s bull market, one user raised concerns about potential downsides. Edwards acknowledges that execution risks, such as custody failure or delta neutrality failure, could have adverse effects. Edwards identifies custody risk as the most significant risk in this context. However, he highlights that any negative impacts will likely be short-lived, and market forces will ultimately dictate Ethena’s net annual percentage yield (APY). Related Reading: Bitcoin To $150,000 Is “Programmed” With Halving Approaching: Analyst In short, by limiting over-leveraging in future markets and reducing spot supply, Ethena could significantly support the price of BTC and extend the current bull run. The daily chart shows that BTC’s price has been trending downward over the past 24 hours. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Currently, BTC’s price has experienced a significant decline, plummeting to the $68,800 level. This marks a 4.3% decrease compared to Monday’s price. In parallel, Ethena’s native token, ENA, has also followed the overall downtrend of the market, reflecting BTC’s price movement with a 4% decrease. Presently, ENA is trading at $1.22.

After a surge over the weekend that brought it close to shattering its all-time high, the digital asset has dipped back below the crucial $70,000 mark in the last 24 hours. This sudden correction has left investors wondering if the predicted surge to $80,000 is still on the table. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Polkadot Shines – Is Now The Time To Buy DOT Before $10? Bitcoin Erases Weekend Gains Just days ago, Bitcoin bulls were celebrating as the price climbed to near record highs exceeding $70,000. This bullish momentum fueled optimism, with analysts like Markus Thielen predicting a swift climb towards $80,000. However, that optimism has been tempered by the recent price drop. Bitcoin has plummeted roughly 6% from its peak, effectively erasing the gains made earlier this week. While the price has recovered slightly to hover around $69,200, it remains below the psychological barrier of $70,000. Is The $80,000 Dream Dead? The recent correction has undoubtedly dampened spirits, but some analysts are still confident that Bitcoin’s journey to $80,000 is far from over. Proponents of this view point to a few key factors that continue to fuel their bullish sentiment. Stablecoin Inflows: A Beacon Of Hope? One factor cited by Thielen is the continued strength of stablecoin inflows. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar, are often used as an entry point for investors into the crypto market. Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView According to Thielen, these robust inflows suggest sustained investor interest despite the short-term price fluctuations. Additionally, he highlights a recent technical chart pattern breakout, specifically a symmetrical triangle, as another bullish indicator. Technical analysts believe such breakouts often signal a continuation of the prior trend, which in this case would be positive for Bitcoin. On-Chain Data Bolsters Bullish Case Some analysts point to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock, which reveals significant buying support at current price levels. This data suggests that a large number of addresses (essentially unique identifiers for cryptocurrency wallets) purchased Bitcoin within the range of $68,200 and $70,325. This buying activity indicates potential resistance against further price dips, as these addresses would likely be hesitant to sell at a loss. Bitcoin price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko Bullish And Bearish Forces The current situation presents a classic tug-of-war between Bitcoin bulls and bears. While the recent price correction has shaken some confidence, strong stablecoin inflows and on-chain buying activity suggest underlying bullish pressure. However, they remain cautious, pointing to the slowdown in investments specifically targeted at spot Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) as a potential concern. These ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Source: CoinShares Meanwhile, a report by CoinShares, a digital asset manager, highlights a significant decrease in inflows to such ETFs in recent weeks, suggesting that some institutional investors might be adopting a wait-and-see approach.

    "content": "Data shows that Bitcoin investor sentiment has cooled to the lowest level since February, something that could facilitate a rebound in the price. Bitcoin Fear \u0026 Greed Index Now Points At Just ‘Greed’ The “Fear \u0026 Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the general sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency sector. This metric uses a numeric scale from zero to hundred to represent the sentiment. To calculate the score, the index considers the data of five factors: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Hits 10% After Crash: What Happened Last Time All values of the indicator above the 53 mark suggest the presence of greed among the investors, while below the 47 level implies a fearful market. The region between these two corresponds to the neutral sentiment. Here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear \u0026 Greed Index looks: The value of the index appears to be 71 at the moment | Source: Alternative As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear \u0026 Greed Index currently has a value of 71, implying that the investors share a majority sentiment of greed. Just yesterday, the index’s value had been notably higher than this, implying that there has been a bit of a cooldown of sentiment in the past 24 hours. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the index over the past year. The value of the indicator seems to have registered a plunge recently | Source: Alternative Besides the three core sentiments, there are also two “extreme” sentiments: extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs at values above 75, while the latter occurs under 25. The Bitcoin Fear \u0026 Greed Index was 79 yesterday, implying that the market had been extremely greedy. The indicator has been regularly inside this zone for the past month, so the current normal greed values go against the trend. The sentiment among investors has naturally been so high recently because the BTC price has gone through a sharp rally in this period and has explored fresh all-time highs (ATHs). The Bitcoin price has historically tended to go against the majority’s expectations. And the stronger this expectation has been, the more likely such a contrary move will occur. Due to this reason, the extreme sentiments have been where reversals in the asset have been the most probable to take place in the past. For instance, the current ATH of the asset formed when the index was at a value of 88.

The fact that it has fallen out of the extreme greed zone, though, may be conducive to a bottom forming. The earlier bottom, around 20 March, also formed when the index exited the zone. The current level of the Bitcoin Fear \u0026 Greed Index is not only lower than it was then but also the lowest since 11 February, when the asset was still trading around $48,000.

    "content": "The recent ratio between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices suggests a potential decline in risk appetite within the crypto market. The ratio has reached its highest level since April 2021, indicating a stronger demand for Bitcoin than its smaller rival, Ethereum. This development has led crypto asset trading firm QCP Capital to speculate that this shift in the ratio could be an early indication of a transition from “fear of missing out” (FOMO) to outright fear. Bitcoin And Ethereum Performance Regarding recent market trends, the second quarter of 2024 has begun with relatively subdued activity. Bitcoin’s price has dipped below the $70,000 mark and has remained range-bound between $65,000 and $68,000 for the past few days despite briefly touching the $70,000 mark on Monday. Related Reading: XRP To $20 And Ethereum To $20,000: Crypto Analyst Reveals When This Will Happen According to QCP’s analysis, the inflow of funds into the spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) market has not been substantial enough to drive significant price movements in either direction. As a result, the company has observed that funding rates have stabilized, and the front end of the forward curve has declined from previous highs of 50% to less than 20% currently. Interestingly, while the front end of the forward curve has decreased, the back end remains elevated. This has led to interest in rolling spot-forward basis positions further out, potentially driven by the continued demand for long-dated Bitcoin calls extending into 2025. The daily chart shows that ETHBTC’s ratio is below the 0.50 level. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com On the other hand, Ethereum’s performance has been relatively weak. QCP also notes that the ETHBTC ratio cross-tests a critical support level after breaking below 0.05. Notably, there has been sustained selling of Ethereum calls, resulting in lower volatility and downward pressure on the price. Ultimately, QCP finds that these developments are prompting speculation as to whether this could be an early sign of FOMO turning into fear, particularly about Ethereum’s role as a proxy for altcoins. While Bitcoin may find support from topside demand and ETF inflows, Ethereum’s performance and its impact on altcoins will be important factors to watch closely. Will BTC Experience A Double-Top? Renowned crypto analyst Crypto Con has raised an intriguing question about whether BTC is poised for a double top similar to the patterns observed in 2013 and 2021. Analyzing previous market cycles, Crypto Con highlights that more evident double tops, such as those witnessed in the first and third cycles of 2021, triggered significant initial surges on the Fisher Transform indicator. In contrast, the 2017 double-top formation showed a more subtle initial rise in June. Notably, all final cycle tops ended with a regular bearish divergence, where the price reached higher levels while the indicator declined, as seen in the chart below. BTC’s past double top patterns.

Crypto Con suggests that if the Fisher Transform indicator can consolidate around these levels without spiking to the line seen in 2013 and 2021, it could indicate a higher likelihood of a single top formation, which is the analyst’s most likely outcome, for December 2024, marking the top of this cycle.

    "content": "Authur Hayes, the co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of cryptocurrency exchange and trading platform, BitMEX has released another blog post, predicting a major fire sale and a potential price decline for Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Fire Sale Imminent In his blog post, Hayes provided a detailed analysis, explaining his perspectives on how the Bitcoin halving event would adversely affect the price of the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu Price To Rise 5000% To $0.001 – Here’s When The Bitcoin halving is an occurrence that takes place every four years which reduces Bitcoin miner block rewards by half. This, in turn, decreases the amount of Bitcoin created and leads to an increase in the cryptocurrency’s value. While most analysts in the crypto market anticipate a bullish rally for Bitcoin and other altcoins during the halving event, Hayes holds a more contradictory view, suggesting that the halving period could instead initiate a more bearish action than expected. Hayes has acknowledged that the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are likely to pump during the halving period, at least in the medium term. However, the BitMEX co-founder has also predicted that the price action of Bitcoin both before and after the halving event could potentially turn negative. He revealed that because the 2024 Bitcoin halving coincides with a period of diminished liquidity in the United States Dollar (USD), it could potentially ignite a “raging fire sale for crypto assets.” The crypto founder also foresees the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plummeting around this time. As a result, Hayes has advised the broader crypto community to refrain from trading cryptocurrencies during this period. He emphasized that when the majority of the market participants agree on a specific outcome, such as a rally induced by the Bitcoin halving, the market tends to move in the opposite direction. Despite his captivating predictions, Hayes conceded that the crypto market could defy his bearish forecasts, essentially recognizing the speculative nature of his prediction. Hayes Says April Is The Best Time To Short Sell In his blog post, Hayes unveiled that the period from April 15 to May 1, 2024, would be precarious for risky assets in the financial sector. This is attributed to tax payments draining liquidity from the system and Quantitative Tightening (QT) accelerating during this timeframe. Related Reading: Expert Maps Out Timeline For The XRP Price To Cross $1,000 The crypto founder has suggested that this period might potentially present a prime short position for traders, indicating that April could be the ideal month for short selling.

    "content": "Cardano (ADA) risks a significant price decline as several on-chain metrics paint a bearish sentiment for the crypto token. This coincides with a recent technical analysis by a crypto analyst, who predicted that ADA could drop to as low as $0.4. ADA Sees Decline In Trading Volume Data from the on-chain analytics platform Messari shows a decline in ADA’s trading volume from its recent peak. The crypto token recorded a daily trading volume of $1.53 billion on March 14 but has been on a steady decline since then, recording a daily trading volume of $445.83 million on April 10. Related Reading: Here Are The Drivers Behind The Bitcoin Price Crash To $68,000 Furthermore, data from IntoTheBlock shows three other on-chain metrics signaling a bearish sentiment for the crypto token. The first is the ‘Net Network Growth,’ which has experienced a 0.17% increase in the past week. This metric measures the total number of ADA addresses, meaning more users have left the ecosystem than new ones have come this last week. The second metric is the ‘In the Money,’ which has seen a 0.20% decline in the last seven days. This metric measures the number of ADA holders that are currently in profit at the crypto token’s price level. Meanwhile, large transactions on the Cardano network have also dropped lately, with a 2.60 decline. These large transactions refer to transactions that are over $100,000, suggesting that ADA whales are cooling off on investing in the crypto token. These bearish on-chain metrics further strengthen crypto analyst Alan Santana’s analysis, in which he mentioned that ADA could drop between $0.4444 and $0.3450. Back then, he noted that ADA still had a bearish outlook from a technical analysis perspective, and this outlook would extend until ADA found a strong support level on the charts. ADA’s Derivatives Market Also Shows Bearish Outlook Data from Coinglass shows that the bears are also firmly in control of the ADA ecosystem. In the last 24 hours, $632,720 has been wiped out from ADA’s derivatives market, with long positions ($502,170) accounting for most of these liquidations.

Meanwhile, trading volume in ADA’s derivatives market has dropped by over 11%, suggesting a declining interest in the ADA token among crypto investors. Furthermore, the Options trading volume paints a more bearish picture, dropping by 92% in the last 24 hours.

However, top cryptocurrency expert and trader Benjamin Cowen cautions that if the price of BTC follows a previous pattern, there may be a correction.

A similar trend that could trigger a correction | Source: Benjamin Cowen on X In response, a pseudonymous user commented on Cowen’s post and reminded the expert that he forgot the arrow backup. Responding to the user, Cowen stated that he believes the outcome of the next phase will depend on whether or not ALT/BTC pairs have collapsed by then. Furthermore, he affirms there could be a move on the upside if they have not broken down. Meanwhile, in the event that they have broken down, the pattern can transit to something new. It is worth noting that the Bitcoin halving event is forecasted to take place within the next 11 days. Given Bitcoin’s halving previous significant impact on price, BTC could be positioned for a notable price surge in the coming days. However, if Cowen’s recent prediction manifests, it could paint a different picture for the crypto asset during the halving event. The expert’s prediction has sent quite a frenzy in the crypto community, with analysts like Peter Brandt supporting his insights. Peter Brandt acknowledged Cowen’s projections noting that previous Bitcoin bull markets have exhibited a similar fundamental trend. What To Expect During The Halving Event As the halving event approaches, the cryptocurrency data analytics platform Kaiko has laid out a perspective to watch out for.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price was up by 8% in the past 7 days, valued at $70,770.

    "content": "As the Bitcoin (BTC) “Halving” approaches, expectations increase about how the flagship cryptocurrency will perform. Bitcoin (BTC) is recovering momentum after facing a significant correction in the first few days of Q2, and some analysts are forecasting new heights for the number one cryptocurrency soon. Related Reading: Beyond Halving: Expert Predicts Bitcoin To Soar Above $200,000 With Surprising Catalyst Are The Odds In The Bulls Or Bears Favor? Bitcoin had its best quarterly close during Q1, 2024. Despite BTC’s stellar performance, as Q2 started, the market was dragged by the leading cryptocurrency’s price correction. Since then, Bitcoin has been steadily recovering, testing the $70,000 resistance level over the weekend. As the week started, BTC appeared to have regained support above the $70,000 level. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez seems to think that Bitcoin’s performance so far reflects a positive sentiment from investors. In an X post, Martinez shared a chart that paints an optimistic picture, at least for now. When you compare support (1.4 million addresses holding 893,000 $BTC between $68,220 and $70,325) with resistance (474,000 addresses holding 285,000 #BTC between $70,760 and $71,200), the odds appear to favor the #Bitcoin bulls! pic.twitter.com/pceCyGa8mb — Ali (@ali_charts) April 9, 2024 According to Martinez’s post, the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) indicator seems favorable to the bulls. Per the chart, the addresses holding BTC at the support level massively outnumber those holding Bitcoin at the resistance level. The chart suggests that Bitcoin is at “stable support” as 474,000 addresses hold 285,000 BTC between $70,760 and $71,200. Meanwhile, 1.4 million addresses hold the flagship cryptocurrency between $68,220 and $70,325. When compared, the addresses and BTC held at the support level nearly triple those in the resistance zone. To the analyst, bulls are the current victors as “odds appear to favor” them. Analyst Forecast Bitcoin To 90,000 Soon Captain Faibik, another crypto analyst, also seems to perceive more bullish momentum for Bitcoin. In an X post, the analyst suggests that BTC’s “bullish pennant upside break is confirmed on the daily chart.” Per the chart, the flagship cryptocurrency’s price started a consolidation period in early March, forming a pennant pattern. This pattern saw an upside breakout after Monday’s daily candle closed above the $70,000 price range. Due to this breakout, the analyst forecasts a surge to the $88,000-$90,000 price range this month. $BTC Bullish Pennant Upside Breakout is Confirmed on the Daily timeframe Chart.. ? Now, Send Bitcoin to the 88-90k this Month. ??#Crypto #BTC #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/ok2DGPXsAb — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) April 9, 2024 At the time of writing, Bitcoin remains above the $70,000 support level, only 5% below its most recent all-time high (ATH) price of $73,373. Despite the positive resistance, BTC’s price performance shows a slight decrease of 2.3% from yesterday. Similarly, its daily trading volume and market capitalization have mildly dropped. According to CoinMarketCap data, BTC’s daily trading volume is down by 6%, while its market cap of $1.38 trillion represents a 2.1% decrease. Nonetheless, Bitcoin remains 8.4% above its price seven days ago, trading at $70,378. Further bullish sentiment, fueled by the upcoming “Halving” event, could help the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization consolidate its support above the current levels.

It is worth noting that Jelle’s forecast is based on his observation of a “bullish pennant” formation, a technical pattern that suggests a potential surge in the price of BTC. According to the analyst, the asset might experience some volatility this month. Jelle emphasized that a bullish pattern is forming, coinciding with the upcoming BTC halving in a few weeks.

Historically, the event has triggered bullish price movements, as reduced supply often leads to increased demand and speculative buying. The Bitcoin halving is currently less than 20 days away.

    "content": "Crypto gaming, aka GameFi, has been one of the biggest trends in the industry during the past few years. The last market cycle, in particular, was a strong one for the growth of decentralized gaming. As with all trends, the sector plateaued somewhat at the start of 2024 but as of March 2024, it’s quickly picking up steam again. The latest statistics from the industry indicate that cryptocurrency gaming as a whole has increased by as much as 35% since January 2024. Interestingly, its growth spurt actually mirrors that of the universally popular Bitcoin (BTC), albeit at a smaller percentage. Meanwhile, according to CoinGecko, the total value of gaming tokens currently in operation stands at well over $28 billion. Crypto Gaming Explained As its name suggests, the crypto gaming segment is a fusion of digital gaming with decentralized currencies. Also known as GameFi (a portmanteau of gaming and finance), crypto gaming projects offer players new ways to participate in and profit from gaming experiences, while the integration of leading coins like BTC and ETH into existing genres has generated an array of crypto-friendly platforms offering everything from Bitcoin pokies to MOBAs and MMORPGs. At its core, crypto gaming makes use of blockchain tech to provide gamers with radical new in-game economies and governance systems. In contrast to traditional gaming sectors, where in-game assets like character skins and loot boxes are controlled by centralized servers, in crypto gaming economies, players genuinely own their digital assets in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These unique digital assets can then be sold and traded in decentralized marketplaces, providing real-world value and, in some cases, a tangible income. Moreover, the presence of blockchain technology enhances the security of decentralized gaming projects. For instance, games built on the Ethereum chain or any of its level 2 chains will utilize smart contracts to both enforce gameplay rules and automate in-game transactions. Plus, the interoperability aspect of some blockchain ledgers can facilitate the use of digital assets across different games and platforms. The Latest Developments in Crypto Gaming For much of GameFi’s existence, the sector has been dominated by titles like Axie Infinity, the Ethereum chain gaming project from Sky Mavis studios. But there are at least 398 active blockchain games now in the market (based on 2022 statistics from Dapp Radar), suggesting that there’s robust interest in such innovations from both the investor side and the gaming community. So far in 2024, a few emerging projects have broken ahead of the pack. MetaCene, a new Web3 MMORPG, has just finished private round-A funding, pulling in $10 million (including support from Animoca Ventures). MadWorld, a mobile NFT shooter, also picked up $11 million in its seed round, with backing from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz. On March 13th, RON, the native token for the Ethereum scaling network focused on gaming, Ronin, hit a new all-time high of $4.56. Ronin is most known for the 2022 flagship game, Axie Infinity, but here in 2024, a new blockchain game is behind its resurgence. The arrival of Pixels, an NFT and token-driven farming game, onto the chain from Polygon has caused a flurry of interest. Although Pixels is defined by single-token Tokenomics, unlike Axie Infinity’s double-token mechanics, its governing coin PIXEL was nevertheless distributed through airdrop based on the total value of RON staked. Not only that, but a few days later March 13th, Kaidro, another Ronin game, underwent its first minting. As an incentive, new users could mint a free NFT for 24 hours, undoubtedly contributing to yet another surge in interest in both Ronin and its native token. Another coin doing well this spring is GALA, the native cryptocurrency for the Gala Games NFT platform. Now truly in a bull run, the coin underwent a 100% price increase in a span of just two days. Within one week, the increased market capitalization added over $1 billion to its cap, reaching as high as $2.072 billion. As a result, the coin has become a standout performer in the top 100 cryptocurrencies of 2024. The Ethereum-based project has also just achieved a golden cross, with its 30-day moving average crossing above its 200-day stats. This is despite its current value sitting way below its recorded all-time high of $0.8248 (November 2021), indicating the potential for a strong upward trend as crypto gaming continues to pick up traction. New Gaming Projects to Look Out For In addition to the standout GameFi projects discussed above, several other coins on the horizon are showing significant promise for growth and stabilization during 2024: Sponge V2 (SPONGEV2) — this upgraded, tokenized version of the existing Sponge ecosystem is currently generating a lot of interest for its high-yield staking capacity. Last year, the project’s market cap swelled to an impressive $100 million from $1 million, and staking yields for SPONGEV2 are set at 212%. 5th Scape (5SCAPE) — a metaverse project, 5th Scape defines itself as the “world’s first AR and VR crypto gaming ecosystem”. Still in the presale stage, so far, it’s already raised over $1.5 million. Disclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

    "content": "Polygon (MATIC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) both recently experienced bearish price performance on the charts and initially worried investors and traders. Yet, two major crypto analysts took note of their price movements and are now projecting a positive price outlook in their future. Alongside them, Pullix (PLX) has a 100x growth potential, and can push towards new heights in 2024 and beyond due to its innovative exchange. We will go over each one of these cryptos to determine which is one of the best cryptos to buy now. Polygon (MATIC) to Retrace to $1 According to Ali Martinez Polygon (MATIC) has recently undergone a broader period of a downward momentum, and this is evident across all of its on-chart metrics. For example, the year-to-date (YTD) Polygon price movement indicates a 22% decline, while its down 16.4% in the past month. As for the weekly price momentum, the Polygon crypto moved down 10%, as it initially reached $1 before retracing to $0.88. According to major crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the MATIC crypto, as it remained strong above $0.87. According to the analyst ,we could see a rebound to $0.95 or $1. Based on the Polygon price prediction, it can end 2024 at $1.37. Shiba Inu (SHIB) to Climb 2x Based on Captain Faibik Analysis Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also moving downwards in value, despite initially having a year-to-date (YTD) climb of 140%. The Shiba Inu price is down 12.3% on the weekly chart, and 24% on the monthly chart. In addition, during the week, the Shiba Inu crypto climbed from a low point of $0.00002595 to a maximum value of $0.0000309. Crypto analyst Captain Faibik recently went over the on-chart data and noted how the crypto is prepared for another 2x rally. As a result, sentiment is bullish on its future, and according to the Shiba Inu price prediction, it can end 2024 at $0.000060. Pullix (PLX) to 100x Fueled by Massive Ecosystem Growth Pullix (PLX) is a hybrid exchange platform that has begun to get accumulated by traders globally fueled by its vast ecosystem and massive token utility. A key catalyst for this growth is its hybrid approach, as the platform combines elements of CEXs and DEXs to create a unified platform in which anyone can get access to any asset, including cryptocurrencies. From CFDs, to OTC derivatives, and perpetual futures, anyone can begin trading with zero commissions, and tight spreads. The Pullix Beta Trading Platform went live, and real money deposits and trading are now available. In addition, users can stake their PLX to the automated market makers (AMMs) on the Pullix platform, and can get passive income with high APY. The token is now listed on BitMart, XT.com, MEXC, Uniswap, and even on the data aggregators CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. As a result of all of these aspects, analysts are projecting a major 100x price increase by Q4, 2024, making it one of the best cryptos to buy now. Summary While both Polygon and Shiba Inu did see a price decline in the past trading sessions, they have the potential to reach new heights throughout 2024 based on the latest analyst projections. However, Pullix can still be a better buy as analysts are projecting a 100x price increase, which can provide the most significant ROI, positioning PLX as the best new crypto to invest in.

    "content": "Once again, the price of Bitcoin rose bullishly, breaking through the $70,000 barrier, demonstrating strength for an upward movement. Bitcoin At $82,000 Remains The Target Following the recent recovery observed today, Crypto Jelle, a popular cryptocurrency expert and Bitcoin enthusiast, has made a bullish forecast for the crypto asset, citing the $82,000 level in the short term. Crypto Jelle highlighted that after a fakeout, Bitcoin retested the cycle highs of 2021, bounced, and then broke out once more. According to the analyst, BTC now has just one more obstacle to surpass as a result of the retest. Related Reading: Are The Odds In Bitcoin Bulls Favor? These Analysts Forecast BTC’s Future Furthermore, he affirms that the race toward new highs will begin when the largest cryptocurrency asset manages to break and hold over $71,500. As a result, the crypto analyst anticipates a rally soon, placing the coin’s next target at around $82,000. BTC retested 2021 cycle high | Source: Crypto Jelle on X Jelle has addressed a pressing issue in the crypto community. He mentioned some are still concerned about the next 3% move, whereas the higher timeframe chart seems more optimistic. Thus, he has urged investors to be patient and hold onto their bags to enjoy the positive move, as the crypto asset appears to be poised for significant growth in the upcoming months. With the impending halving event anticipated to occur this month, Jelle’s prediction could develop in a short period. Halvings have historically been seen to have a significant effect on the coin. If this year’s halving mirrors past trends, BTC could surge to $82,000 in weeks and even further upward. Several analysts believe that the event could propel the price of BTC to $150,000 before the end of the year. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $70,344, indicating a 1.84% increase in the past 24 hours. Both its overall market cap and trading volume have also risen by 1.87% and 13% respectively in the past day. Speculated Price Target For BTC This Month Ever since BTC witnessed a price recovery, many bullish predictions have surfaced concerning its next trajectory. Another analyst who has predicted BTC to reach above the $80,000 range is Adrian Zidanic. Related Reading: 12 Days Until Bitcoin Halving: Why $100,000 Isn’t Much Further Away During an episode on Thinking Crypto, Tony Edward the show’s host, drew attention to Zidanic’s prediction, in which the expert pointed out a bullish ascending triangle that is emerging in the Bitcoin chart within this consolidation phase. Zidanic foresees a breakout occurring shortly, with $86,500 as his target price. Although his projections acknowledge a greater likelihood of a positive scenario unfolding within the month. Examining the chart, Edward expressed his optimism that the aforementioned price could manifest post-halving. Edward believes it could move further to $90,000, underscoring his price range between $85,000 and $90,000 and urging the community to be patient.

    "content": "TLDR The United States-based cryptocurrency firm and exchange Coinbase has secured restricted dealer licenses in Canada, doubling on global expansion amid a regulatory crackdown. NuggetRush’s presale heads for the $4 million mark as investors rush its launchpad round just before it goes live. The meme coin’s allure comes from its use cases—P2E gameplay, social impact, various rewarding avenues, and stringent security measures. Coinbase has registered as a restricted dealer under the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). According to CSA, restricted dealer registration is a special type of dealing registration for firms that do not neatly fall into any other category. International dealers are not allowed to trade with Canadian customers in equity or debt securities of Canadian issuers other than government issuers. According to the new requirements, local crypto trading platforms should comply with stricter custody standards, limitations on leveraging, and a prohibition on trading stablecoins without obtaining prior written consent from the CSA. In light of growing crypto regulatory measures, the spotlight turns toward projects like NuggetRush (NUGX) at the intersection of blockchain innovation, profitability, and security. This new meme coin has seen rising momentum since the start of its presale, selling about 271 million tokens so far. This article details NuggetRush’s ongoing blockchain ICO as it witnesses a massive influx. \u003e\u003e Buy NuggetRush Now \u003c\u003c NuggetRush (NUGX): Secure And Exciting DeFi Adoption NuggetRush goes beyond the meme coin status with its innovative Play-to-Earn gaming model, GameFi, and NFT (non-fungible token) owning and staking feature, attracting significant attention from investors. NuggetRush is one of the best altcoins that offers an exciting NFT-packed mining game experience. The platform also facilitates easy trading of game assets, while its token holders benefit from active community participation and the social allure of meme coins. NuggetRush has completed its presale. Also, NuggetRush aims to reach a market capitalization of $100 million, making it one of the top altcoins with the capacity for success. NuggetRush is one of the highly anticipated launches in the meme coin sector. Rising interest in the presale saw it blast through the $3.75 million milestone, selling nearly 271 million tokens. Transparency and community-driven governance are at the core of NUGX’s ecosystem. Its smart contract has undergone a comprehensive audit by SolidProof, a respected cybersecurity firm, ensuring stringent security measures are in place. Also, the smart contract will be renounced post-launch, giving full control to the RUSHGUILD members – a truly decentralized approach. As a governance token, the RUSHGUILD members also have the decision and voting rights to influence how the ecosystem and game are developed, alongside access to discounts and exclusive content. NuggetRush’s well-strategized functionalities and multiple earning schemes reflect its prospects in the fast-rising meme coin sector. These features can pave the way for a potential long-term bullish momentum for NUGX, with its DeFi coin price reaching new highs. \u003e\u003e Buy NuggetRush Now \u003c\u003c Conclusion Coinbase’s expansion into Canada has cleared the hurdle of a “restricted dealer” registration. Since the country set up new crypto policies last year, this registration is a significant milestone, as it will accelerate the adoption of digital assets, foster economic empowerment, and reshape the financial system in Canada. The blockchain ICO sector also feels the regulatory checks, creating the demand for projects that promote integrity and accountability. NuggetRush is turning heads across the crypto divide because of its tangible utility and focus on social impact, amongst other exciting and rewarding propositions. Its presale, which has sold millions of tokens, is over. Visit NuggetRush Presale Website Disclaimer: This is a sponsored story.

    "content": "As anticipation builds for potential price surges in Cardano and XRP, a new contender, Raboo, enters the cryptocurrency scene, igniting excitement among investors. With an entry-level token presale price of just $0.0036 and predictions of a 100x surge in 2024, hot new crypto Raboo is poised to disrupt the $62 billion meme market, drawing significant attention and speculation from crypto enthusiasts. Riding the Ripple: Unveiling XRP’s Potential and Price Projections in 2024 XRP offers several compelling features, including its speed and efficiency in cross-border payments, low transaction fees, and scalability. These attributes make XRP attractive for financial institutions and remittance companies. Price predictions for XRP vary widely among analysts. Some foresee a potential surge to $1 or higher in 2024, considering the release of a Ripple stablecoin. Others are more conservative, anticipating further declines. Despite its potential, XRP has faced SEC lawsuits in the past. In March of 2024, the SEC demanded that XRP’s mother company, Ripple, pay almost a $2 billion fine. It is fighting the judgment, but the XRP price is still trending sideways. Cardano (ADA): Scaling New Heights in Blockchain Innovation and Price Performance Cardano (ADA) stands out with its innovative features and vision for a decentralized future. One of Cardano’s key strengths lies in its peer-reviewed development approach, ensuring robustness and security in its protocols. Cardano prioritizes scalability, aiming to accommodate a wide range of applications while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, its focus on interoperability fosters seamless integration with other blockchain networks, enhancing its utility. The live Cardano price today reflects its stability and growing adoption, attracting both investors and developers alike. With a 24-hour trading volume of $430,034,733 USD, Cardano demonstrates strong liquidity and market interest. Its commitment to research-driven development and community governance further solidifies its position as a leading blockchain platform in the cryptocurrency space. Raboo: Revolutionizing Crypto Investment with Memes and Rewards Raboo, the hot new crypto sensation, is magnetizing investors with its innovative approach and enticing features. Its unique tokenomics framework offers an exhilarating journey through meme culture, providing meme enthusiasts with a platform to engage in entertaining activities and earn rewards. The integration of social-fi and artificial intelligence (AI) elements for meme generation represents a dynamic fusion of technology and creativity, injecting an additional layer of excitement into the crypto space. By incorporating AI, Raboo offers users an innovative platform where memes are not just static images but interactive and engaging experiences. Moreover, the social-fi aspect amplifies the communal aspect of meme culture, fostering a vibrant community where members can connect, collaborate, and compete in fun-filled activities. Raboo hosts thrilling crypto prize draws and giveaways, fostering community engagement and rewarding participants with valuable tokens and rewards. With an engagement-focused approach and a vibrant community spirit, Raboo stands out as a promising investment opportunity, appealing to both meme aficionados and crypto enthusiasts alike. Conclusion While Cardano and XRP may see potential surges, the excitement surrounding Raboo indicates a promising future for the crypto market.

    "content": "Ethereum Layer-2 solutions to hit $1 trillion in market cap by 2023 based on data from investment manager VanEck. According to the report, they can capitalize on Ethereum’s primary challenge, its limited capacity to process, store and compute data. Two of the largest scaling solutions include Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP), which have seen solid price performance as-well. However, another project built on Ethereum is also rising, and that’s KangaMoon (KANG) which spiked 290%. Today, we will go over their price performance to see how far they can rise, and to see which will be one of the top DeFi projects. KangaMoon (KANG) Up 290% KangaMoon (KANG) can experience a remarkable level of growth as it has already begun to dominate the charts following its monumental rise in value from $0.005 to $0.0196 marking a 290% increase. It’s also raised over $4.3 million and can raise $4.7 million during the week. The key reason for this massive momentum is because the crypto goes beyond the classic trope of meme coins and introduces a vast ecosystem that rewards players with massive token utility. On top of the platform, there is a Play-to-Earn (P2E) element, coupled with Social-Fi features and a community-driven approach. Players can create their own KangaMoon character and through it, can enter tournaments, fights, or even place bets on battles in order to get rewards in the form of KANG tokens or NFTs. In fact, there are now over 5,800 KANG holders, and the community has over 20,000 registered users. Based on the latest analyst projections, the crypto can spike 100x following its launch, making it one of the top DeFi projects. Arbitrum (ARB) to Spike to $2.32 by the End of Q4, 2024 Arbitrum (ARB) has displayed a price correction phase in the short-term, where it dipped 30.3% in the past 30 days. However, the year-to-date (YTD) climb for the Arbitrum price was by 24%, and during the past week, it moved up from $1.44 to $1.69. If the Layer-2 solutions for Ethereum do hit $1 trillion in market cap, the Arbitrum crypto has massive growth potential, and could soon regain significant bullish attention. According to the Arbitrum price prediction, it can end 2024 at $2.32. Optimism (OP) to Reach $5.50 by the End of the Year Optimism (OP) is another Layer-2 scaling solution which showcased a year-to-date (YTD) growth of 43%. Moreover, during the previous week, the Optimism price spiked from a low point of $3.02 to $3.79, and at this rate, it is closer towards breaking the $4 price barrier. Moreover, according to the on-chart metrics, the Optimism crypto’s RSI and MACD data are optimistic, and signal a potential price uptrend. According to the Optimism price prediction, by Q4, 2024, it can reach $5.50. Summary It’s clear that Layer-2 solutions are the future, and with that in mind Arbitrum and Optimism have major growth potential. For the time being, the most bullish performance was however experienced by KangaMoon which has surged 290% and can reach a growth of 100x following its launch. These aspects position it as the best DeFi crypto to jump into in 2024 and beyond. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) Presale Today!

    "content": "Cryptocurrencies are a recent addition to the trade scene, but they’ve already found a place alongside metals, forex and indices. Now, thanks to the Pullix (PLX) trading platform, traders can access all these different markets in one place. Certain analysts hint that this DeFi coin may rise by 100x in 2024. Let’s see why. Combining the Best Features of CEX and DEX Pullix (PLX) is the world’s first hybrid trading platform. In other words, Pullix combines the best of DEX and CEX into one platform. Therefore, traders can access all asset classes on Pullix, including cryptocurrencies, Forex, gold, OTC derivatives and more. You can trade all these through just one platform, which is more convenient than most trading platforms. With this many options to choose from, your portfolio will automatically be diversified and your chances of making profits multiply. This DeFi project also boasts complete privacy, as it requires no sign-up KYC checks. As the demand for privacy continues growing, this feature could make Pullix a fan-favorite for countless individuals. Recently, Pullix released the beta version of this platform and countless individuals are rushing to take part in it. The Role of the PLX Token The PLX token lies at the center of the Pullix ecosystem. This DeFi coin is full of utility. For example, traders who possess PLX tokens enjoy reduced trading fees, access premium features and more. To stand out from most DeFi coins, PLX is also the very first “Trade-to-Earn” crypto. In other words, Pullix will reward PLX stakers with a portion of their daily earnings. This will improve liquidity and engagement since the more trades are made, the more rewards there will be for stakers. Another exciting aspect of PLX is its token burn mechanism. To clarify, Pullix implements a burn event, which will reduce this DeFi coin’s supply over time. Therefore, scarcity will set in and increase PLX’s value in the future. With this development, long-term PLX token holders stand to benefit. A Potential 100x Jump for this DeFi Crypto Currently, PLX is worth just $0.094. However, demand for it is skyrocketing. Major crypto exchanges and data aggregators such as MEXC, CoinMarketCap, BitMart, CoinGecko and Uniswap have already listed this DeFi token. As more Tier-1 exchanges opt to list PLX, more eyes will be drawn to it. Pullix will also enter flourishing markets like the OTC derivatives one. According to BIS, this market grew by 13% in the second half of 2022 to reach $20.7T before the year ended. This DeFi project strategically positions itself to dominate this market and capitalize on its growth. Therefore, market analysts forecast a 100x surge for PLX within Q3 of 2024. Pullix (PLX): One of the Best DeFi Projects Right Now In conclusion, Pullix is a game changer in the trading space. With its innovative features, traditional trading might be disrupted. As Pullix keeps gaining traction and popularity, the PLX DeFi coin also experiences growth each day. Thanks to its low market cap, it will need a small amount of new funds for its price to 100x – making PLX the best DeFi crypto to buy.

    "content": "Franklin Templeton’s digital assets division has released a note to its investors introducing Bitcoin-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs), highlighting a surge in activity within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The asset manager attributes this increased momentum to various factors, including the emergence of Bitcoin (BTC) NFTs called Ordinals, the development of new fungible standards like BRC-20 and Runes, the growth of Bitcoin Layer 2 (L2s) solutions, and the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Ordinals Shine According to the Bitcoin ETF issuer’s report, activity in the Bitcoin NFT space is gaining momentum. In particular, Ordinals have seen a significant increase in trading volume over the past few months. This growth is evident in Bitcoin’s dominance in terms of trading volume, which surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in December 2023, as shown in the accompanying chart. BTC Ordinals growth since late 2023.

Binance Coin Futures Market Under Pressure With Negative Funding Rates In addition, several collections of Bitcoin Ordinals are emerging as dominant players in the NFT market, both in terms of trading volume and market capitalization. These collections include NodeMonkes, Runestone, and Bitcoin Puppets, which have an aggregate market cap of $353 million, $339 million, and $168 million, respectively. They are the most notable collections. In terms of trading volume over the past 30 days, the report shows that these three collections recorded trading volumes of $81 million, $85 million, and $38 million, respectively, over the past month. The asset manager further claimed that what distinguishes BTC Ordinals from NFTs on other blockchains, such as Ethereum or Solana, is that they contain raw data recorded directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This feature contributes to the attractiveness and growing popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals, as evidenced by market cap and trading volume figures. Franklin Templeton, known for its involvement in the ETF market, was one of the issuers that launched a spot BTC ETF in the United States earlier this year. Its ETF, which trades under the ticker name “EZBC,” has seen total inflows of 281.8 million since its January 11 launch, according to BitMEX research data as of April 3. Despite its zero-fee structure, Franklin Templeton’s ETF has seen a significant difference in flows compared to the leading players in the newly approved ETF market, such as Blackrock (IBIT) and Fidelity (FBTC), which have seen flows of over 14 billion and 7.7 billion, respectively. Binance To Discontinue Support For BTC NFTs In a recent blog post, crypto exchange Binance announced it would discontinue support for Bitcoin-based NFTs on its marketplace. Less than a year after their introduction, Binance will no longer facilitate airdrops, benefits, or utilities associated with BTC NFTs, citing a need to streamline its product offerings in the NFT space.

Binance states that users who own Bitcoin NFTs are advised to withdraw them from the Binance NFT marketplace via the Bitcoin network before May 18, 2024. Effective April 18, 2024, users can no longer purchase, deposit, bid, or list NFTs via the BTC network on the Binance NFT Marketplace. Any existing listing orders affected by this change will be automatically canceled simultaneously. The 1-D chart shows that BTC’s price is trending upward. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Currently, BTC is trading at $68,300, up a modest 3% in the last 24 hours. It is approaching the significant milestone of $70,000, a level the cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain several times.

    "content": "Every trader and analyst is talking about meme coins in the crypto market. Among the thousands now available, three stand out: Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and KangaMoon (KANG). While you may be familiar with PEPE and SHIB, as they are well-established, KANG is a Stage 5 presale star that may become the next $1 meme coin in 2024. Pepe (PEPE): Trading in the Green Recently, Pepe (PEPE) has been riding a bullish wave. According to CoinMarketCap data, the Pepe price increased from $0.0000053 to $0.0000070 over the last 30 days. Its market cap surged from $2.25B to $2.94B during that time. Not only that, but the technical analysis of the Pepe coin shows bullish signs. For example, this meme coin is now trading above its 21-day EMA. There are now 15 technical indicators showing buy signals for Pepe as well. Thus, experts made a bullish Pepe price prediction. They forecast a surge to $0.000012 for PEPE within Q2 of 2024. Shiba Inu (SHIB): One of the Meme Coin Titans Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is another meme coin that is seeing a bullish trend. Notably, the Shiba Inu price has jumped from $0.000026 to $0.000027. Crypto analyst Crypto Faibik predicts this meme coin will soon see another 2x bullish rally. From a technical analysis perspective, the Shiba Inu crypto will continue surging. At the moment, Shiba Inu is now trading above its 50 and 100-day EMAs. Not only that, over 19 SHIB technical indicators are in the green. As a result, prominent market analysts foresee a jump to $0.000041 within Q2 of 2024 in their Shiba Inu price predictions. KangaMoon (KANG): A Member of the Best New Meme Coins KangaMoon (KANG) is a new player in the meme coin space. This rising presale star has already raised over $4.2M and is projected to reach $5M. Moreover, those who bought in early now enjoy a 290% ROI. Unlike most meme coins, KANG is a coin with utility. In KangaMoon’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, players use the KANG token as the main currency to buy in-game items and level up their characters. And it doesn’t stop there; KANG holders will gain access to exclusive challenges that will reward them with more tokens or in-game items. Another exciting aspect of KangaMoon is its community-driven focus. Most importantly, KangaMoon rewards its most active community members with free KANG tokens before its official launch. As a result, over 20,000 community members are now rushing to share/like/retweet KangaMoon’s social media posts. This meme coin is currently worth just $0.0196 as it is in Stage 5 of its presale. Experts believe it could be worth $1 when it lists on a Tier-1 CEX platform in Q2 of 2024, which seems reasonable given the pace at which P2E gaming is growing—it’s anticipated to reach $885M by 2028. Will KangaMoon Outpace Pepe and Shiba Inu? KangaMoon could soon leave Pepe and Shiba Inu in the dust. With its low market cap of $19.6M, the meme coin is poised to require fewer new funds to push it higher. This strategy gives KangaMoon a leg up on its rivals and could set it up for a big win. Thus, follow the links below and obtain a 10% bonus if interested in KANG. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) Presale Today!

    "content": "Bitcoin, one analyst notes on X, is looking healthy for the first time since the coin soared to over $70,000, printing all-time highs back in March 2024. The assessment is due to funding rates dropping to within ordinary levels, an indicator that volatility is also falling and moments of fear of missing out (FOMO) are fading. BTC funding rate is dropping | Analyst on X Funding Rates At “Normal Levels” As FOMO Dissipates In crypto perpetual trading, the funding rate is the fee exchanged between market participants. These fees are market-determined and are adjusted every eight hours or so. Depending on market conditions, they can be positive or negative. However, they play a critical role in determining momentum. Of note, bulls pay a fee to bears When perpetual prices are higher than the spot price. This, in turn, discourages buying in the perpetual market and incentivizes buying into the spot, bringing prices closer. Related Reading: CEO Throws Cold Water On May Ethereum ETF Approval – Impact On Price Whenever prices rally, as has been the case since the start of the year when Bitcoin has generally been in the green, those who enter long have to pay sellers to keep prices from deviating, as mentioned above. However, at spot rates, the rate leveraged buyers are paying is slightly lower as FOMO drops. Once prices rapidly expand, ideally above March 2024 highs, this funding rate will likely increase to February and March 2024 levels. Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView So far, Bitcoin is changing hands above $70,800 at spot rates and within a bullish formation. Of note is that buyers are in charge of reversing losses posted on April 8. Even so, for the uptrend to remain, prices must break out above $72,500 and the April 8 high on rising volume. BTC will likely float to over $73,800 and enter price discovery in that case. Bitcoin Rises After CPI Data In The United States, Institutions Pouring In? With FOMO dissipating and “normalcy resuming,” the analyst said the coin is now better positioned to soar higher, backed by organic momentum generated from market participants. After dipping slightly on April 9, the coin rose following positive news about the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States. While the “hot” CPI pushed other assets lower, Bitcoin prices bounced to spot levels. Experts say the coin might benefit as risk-averse traders shift to safe-haven coins to shield their value from raging inflation.

As institutions pour in, buying shares of spot BTC ETFs issued by players like Fidelity, the demand for the underlying coin might soar to fresh levels, lifting prices. Moreover, some analysts are bullish, saying prices will benefit once GBTC stops offloading coins.

    "content": "The cryptocurrency bull market has mostly sustained its impressive momentum, and despite some blips in price growth, investors are getting more optimistic. While this is noteworthy, the true opportunities lie within the smaller altcoin markets, where a handful of tokens have recently stood out prominently. Specifically, 5th Scape (5SCAPE), Smog (SMOG), and eTukTuk (TUK) are capturing significant investor interest. We provide comprehensive insights into these projects here, covering all the essential details you need to know. 5th Scape Takes On The VR World 5th Scape (5SCAPE) is dedicated to pioneering the world’s inaugural Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) ecosystem, aimed at connecting the brightest minds. Their ambitious vision encompasses developing VR games, hardware, and animations, supported by a meticulous strategy. The key to 5th Scape’s success lies in ensuring broad accessibility and compatibility with existing headsets and hardware. To achieve this, the team is focused on creating VR games that seamlessly integrate with popular headsets like Oculus Rift and Meta Quest 3. Additionally, they plan to develop a proprietary VR headset and AR gaming chair once firmly established in the industry. Regarding specific VR game development, the team has unveiled several titles in progress, including Cage Conquest, Epic Cricket Arena, Immersive Kickoff, Archery Master, and Thrust Hunter. Cage Conquest holds particular significance as a combat sports-based game set for initial release, tentatively scheduled for the second quarter of 2024. The project’s native token, 5SCAPE, serves as the foundation of the ecosystem, acting as essential fuel for various interactions. It functions as the universal currency across all 5th Scape games, hardware products, and the developer marketplace. Token holders enjoy exclusive discounts compared to other payment methods, making it the preferred mode of payment for game access and in-game transactions. 5SCAPE token holders also have the opportunity to stake their tokens, earning rewards through active project engagement. Additionally, the 5th Scape team aims to empower token holders by enabling them to vote on fund distribution for marketplace projects, encouraging community involvement in significant project development decisions. In terms of tokenomics, 5SCAPE has a total token supply of 5.21 billion. The 5th Scape presale aims to distribute 80% of the total supply, with a fundraising target of up to $15 million. The presale is conducted in 12 stages, with the current price set at $0.00285 and the listing price at $0.01. To date, it has raised over $3.8 million. Smog Dominates Meme Coin Conversations Meme coins consistently dominate the landscape of rapidly expanding cryptocurrency tokens, competing fiercely for top positions. This trend has been unmistakably apparent over the past year, with numerous meme coins consistently outpacing the broader market. It is expected that this trend will continue into the future, with the meme coin sector remaining one of the most dynamic and effective avenues for generating returns. Among the contenders in the meme coin category, Smog (SMOG) emerges as a significant player. This Solana-based meme coin has rapidly gained traction on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), achieving a $2 million market capitalization on Jupiter. The forthcoming airdrop, alongside an ongoing 10% discount offer, suggests the potential for substantial growth. SMOG follows the footsteps of successful predecessors like Bonk and Myro, both of which experienced remarkable growth trajectories. Notably, SMOG’s DEX trading volumes have even surpassed those of Uniswap in recent times. With its impressive momentum, SMOG stands poised to surpass the achievements of SPONGE, which surged 50x from $2 million to $100 million. Consequently, SMOG emerges as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies for investment at present, with the imminent airdrop potentially propelling it to the forefront as the leading meme coin of 2024. eTukTuk Puts The Environment First eTukTuk (TUK) embodies this principle while setting itself apart with a unique framework and specific application, capitalizing on industry advancements and innovations made over the past decade. By integrating blockchain technology and AI advancements, eTukTuk addresses carbon emissions by advocating for environmentally friendly transportation alternatives. The initiative aims to drive the global shift toward electric vehicles, with the eTukTuk EV as its flagship product, offering an affordable and reliable alternative to traditional TukTuks. Supported by an ecosystem of efficient charging stations, it assists drivers in maximizing earnings while providing various benefits to all involved parties. Your engagement as a user not only contributes to the solution but also allows you to enjoy the benefits of reduced carbon emissions. The significance of the TUK token becomes evident as it provides users with advantages through the expansion of the network’s efficient charging stations. In addition to environmental benefits, the team emphasizes the positive impact on underserved communities facing financial disparities and higher living expenses. Despite the ambitious goal of “permanently eradicating carbon emissions from our planet,” the project underscores its commitment to environmental improvement. eTukTuk seamlessly integrated the Layer 2 opBNB from the BNB Chain, demonstrating its dedication to efficiency and innovation, and presenting attractive opportunities for early adopters in the cryptocurrency sphere. This transition was driven by the adoption of the Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism on the BNB Chain, a methodology that experienced significant growth last year. Currently, the TUK token is available at a presale price of $0.0295, having garnered over $2.7 million in funding. Staking opportunities are also accessible, with immediate staking of the token post-purchase offering an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 143%, further enhancing its appeal. Conclusion The ongoing crypto bull market is set to be remembered in the annals of cryptocurrency history for the emergence of numerous prominent altcoins. Among them, 5th Scape (5SCAPE), Smog (SMOG), and eTukTuk (TUK) stand out as notable examples, highlighting the extensive roster of rapidly ascending altcoins. We recommend promptly exploring their presale opportunities and following their social media channels for updates. Check Out Smog Disclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

    "content": "In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, 2024 marks an important moment for the crypto space, offering seasoned investors and newcomers the chance to discover undervalued tokens and hidden gems with potential for significant growth. Currently overlooked, these potential titans promise significant returns and a revolution in the application and perception of blockchain technology. The challenge lies in discerning these opportunities within the market’s volatility and unpredictability. It requires thoroughly analyzing market dynamics, technological innovations, and community trends. This list introduces four promising tokens, defined by their innovative solutions and potential to reshape the crypto ecosystem. A balanced approach—merging optimism with caution—is crucial as we explore these undervalued tokens. The crypto market’s rewards come with inherent risks, stressing the need for informed decision-making. This list aims to guide you through cryptocurrency’s complex landscape, helping you towards opportunities where innovation and potential for growth align. BLD (Agoric): Pioneering DeFi innovations The crypto market is experiencing significant growth in blockchain’s integration into traditional industries, with the market valuation of Web3 expected to reach USD 116.51 billion by 2033. BLD, with its foundational role in the Agoric ecosystem, is well-placed to capitalize on these trends. Its integration into the Cosmos ecosystem and the broader interchain economy enhances its appeal, offering a versatile utility in a market increasingly inclined towards interoperability and decentralized applications. BLD’s unique proposition lies in its dual role of ensuring platform security through staking and facilitating governance within the Agoric ecosystem. It is designed to support the economic vitality and decentralization of the network, offering stakeholders a say in governance decisions and rewarding them for their participation. The token’s scarcity, tied to its staking mechanism, introduces a unique economic dynamic that could attract investors looking for tokens with a limited supply. The recently launched orchestration capabilities of Agoric are a key enhancement to BLD’s ecosystem, seamlessly bridging the complexity of multi-chain applications. This innovation elevates the platform’s technological prowess and empowers developers with the tools to create more integrated and efficient DeFi solutions. Through its orchestration, Agoric overcomes the challenges of asynchronous communication and disparate blockchain protocols, further strengthening BLD’s position in the market. The strong community support for BLD underscores its growth and adoption. Agoric has demonstrated a robust commitment to engaging its community through initiatives like monthly community calls for transparency and involvement and developer bounties to incentivize innovation. Such engagement promotes the token and signals confidence in the ecosystem, attracting new users and developers. The growth potential of BLD is further amplified by Agoric’s strategic positioning and technological advancements. The use of JavaScript for smart contracts potentially taps into the global JavaScript developer community, lowering the barrier to entry for creating dApps on Agoric’s platform. Additionally, with multiple stakeholder partners and a focus on network participation and governance, the increasing demand for DeFi solutions and broader blockchain adoption rates suggest a promising future for BLD, with the potential for significant price appreciation and long-term growth. For those interested in investing in BLD, it is actively traded across prominent exchanges like Gate.io, CoinEx, Osmosis, Coinlist Pro, and HTX. Prospective investors should engage with the Agoric community through forums and social media, which can provide valuable insights and opportunities for direct participation in the ecosystem’s growth. ALGO (Algorand): The efficiency expert Algorand is charting a course toward solving the blockchain trilemma, ensuring speed, security, and decentralization in harmony. Its status as a carbon-negative network places it at the forefront of eco-friendly blockchain solutions, with a rapidly expanding ecosystem encompassing DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 projects. The blockchain sector increasingly embraces sustainable practices, with Algorand leading the charge. Its commitment to carbon negativity sets a precedent for environmentally conscious blockchain networks, meeting the rising demand for green technologies in the digital asset sphere. Algorand’s cornerstone is its effective resolution of the blockchain trilemma through a pure proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This approach guarantees high security, swift transaction speeds, and genuine decentralization, making Algorand a favored platform among developers and institutions. Its collaboration with El Salvador to develop governmental blockchain infrastructures and the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) underscore its growing impact and dependability. Recent strides include partnerships with academic entities like the University of Florida to bolster blockchain education and DeFi innovations. The Algorand Foundation’s launch of significant funds, such as the $300 million Viridis DeFi fund and a $250 million fund with SkyBridge and NAX, aims to nurture decentralized applications on its network, highlighting Algorand’s dedication to ecosystem growth and blockchain adoption. The Algorand community’s vibrant support and enthusiasm, visible in social media discussions, showcase the platform’s advanced technology, sustainability initiatives, and potential to revolutionize the DeFi sector. This robust community support is a testament to Algorand’s bright future and influence on the digital finance landscape. With recognition from global asset managers like Grayscale Investment and the creation of its first NFT marketplace, Algorand’s prospects are promising. These developments, along with forthcoming events and platform updates, position Algorand as a leading blockchain network poised for significant growth and innovation in the cryptocurrency market. For those looking to dive into Algorand, engaging with its ecosystem through ALGO tokens, exploring its DeFi and NFT offerings, or participating in community discussions are great starting points. Algorand stands as a prime example of innovative and sustainable blockchain technology, offering a glimpse into the future of decentralized finance and digital governance. AVAX (Avalanche): The interoperability pioneer Avalanche (AVAX) has emerged as a significant player in the blockchain space, with rapid developments and a strong market performance that underscores its potential. Launched in September 2020, Avalanche has become known for its fast smart contracts platform. It addresses some critical limitations of older blockchain platforms, like centralization, slow transaction speeds, and scalability issues. Its mainnet anniversary was marked by a $230 million private sale of AVAX tokens to bolster its public ecosystem, showcasing robust investor confidence and its status as one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies. Avalanche’s strategic focus has been enhancing its ecosystem through key partnerships and initiatives. Its strategic emphasis on real-world assets (RWAs) and GameFi, ahead of 2024, has positioned Avalanche at the forefront of these burgeoning blockchain narratives. Strategic partnerships with banking giants like JPMorgan Chase and CitiBank to leverage Avalanche for RWA projects, alongside the launch of Avalanche Vista, a $50 million fund dedicated to RWA research and development, have been pivotal. These moves align with predictions that $3 trillion worth of assets will be tokenized within the next five years, positioning AVAX for significant growth. Avalanche’s on-chain transactions have seen a considerable uptick, driven by GameFi activity and an increase in the monthly subnet transaction count. Over 300% growth in GameFi activity since October and a 36% surge in subnet transactions underscore Avalanche’s growing appeal. The network’s processing capacity of more than 19 million transactions in January, along with its comprehensive ecosystem hosting over 270 projects, including Tether, SushiSwap, Chainlink, Circle, and The Graph, speaks to its scalability and the robustness of its infrastructure. The community around Avalanche is notably bullish about its future, reflecting a strong belief in the project’s roadmap and its ability to revolutionize the DeFi sector. The successful AP4 activation on the Fuji Testnet, which brought cheaper fees, increased processing speed, and full support from Moralis for easier dApp development, has further fueled community enthusiasm. Avalanche’s market performance, strategic initiatives, and strong community support paint a promising picture for its future in the blockchain industry. ECLD (Ethernity Cloud): Decentralizing Cloud Computing with Blockchain The integration of blockchain into the cloud computing industry marks a fundamental shift towards enhanced security and privacy. Ethernity Cloud is at the forefront of this evolution, offering a decentralized platform that promises to revolutionize the way we think about data storage and processing. With its native token, ECLD, playing a critical role in this ecosystem, Ethernity Cloud leverages blockchain technology to ensure data confidentiality, making it an intriguing prospect for potential growth. The unique value proposition of Ethernity Cloud lies in its approach to addressing the inherent vulnerabilities and inefficiencies of traditional centralized cloud services. The platform enhances opportunities of DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure network) applications through a decentralized computations ecosystem, addressing reliability, security, and efficiency challenges. The platform’s integration of EVM smart contracts, multi-chain architecture, and IPFS for robust data storage solutions highlights its commitment to technological innovation and security. Ethernity Cloud’s community engagement is a testament to its dedication to transparency and user empowerment. The platform encourages active participation through developer bounties, governance roles, and an open dialogue with its user base. This encourages a strong sense of community and trust, further solidifying the token’s position in the market. In the past few months, Ethernity Cloud has seen significant growth related to liquidity initiatives and community programs such as the Liquidity Reward Program and a partnership with Gleam for an airdrop campaign. The growth potential for ECLD is promising, driven by the increasing demand for decentralized cloud computing solutions. As businesses and individuals become more aware of the importance of data privacy and security, Ethernity Cloud’s solution stands out as a compelling alternative to traditional offerings. With DePIN’s ecosystem continuing to grow, Ethernity Cloud has the potential to offer even more innovative solutions for managing physical resources on a decentralized blockchain network, connecting the digital and physical worlds. This positions ECLD as a token with not only immediate utility but also long-term value within the ecosystem. Getting involved is straightforward for those interested in exploring the possibilities with Ethernity Cloud. The platform and its token, ECLD, are accessible on several exchanges, offering plenty of investment opportunities. Additionally, joining the Ethernity Cloud community through forums, social media, and participating in governance allows investors to directly contribute to and benefit from the platform’s growth. Risk vs. reward While undervalued tokens present promising opportunities, navigating the landscape of cryptocurrency investment comes with its inherent risks and potential rewards. Market volatility remains a significant concern, with prices subject to dramatic fluctuations that can affect investment value quickly. Regulatory changes also pose a risk, as the evolving legal framework around cryptocurrencies can impact market stability and investment security. Technological risks, including security vulnerabilities, add another layer of complexity, necessitating vigilant security practices to protect investments from theft and fraud. To manage these risks effectively, diversification across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes is key, helping to mitigate the impact of any single investment’s poor performance. Thorough research and due diligence are crucial, enabling investors to make informed decisions and understand the intricacies of their investment choices. With a balanced approach, incorporating careful planning and risk management strategies, investors can potentially realize significant gains, capitalizing on the long-term growth prospects of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion The tokens spotlighted in this list, BLD, ECLD, AVAX, and ALGO, represent significant yet undervalued, opportunities in the dynamic crypto market. Each brings unique advantages and innovative solutions to the table—BLD with its focus on secure, JavaScript-based smart contracts for the Agoric ecosystem, ECLD in revolutionizing cloud computing through decentralized and secure data processing, AVAX in spearheading DeFi and asset tokenization to bridge traditional and blockchain finance, and ALGO by addressing the blockchain trilemma to offer a balanced mix of speed, security, and decentralization. These tokens are set to benefit from the crypto market’s anticipated growth, fueled by technological strides, strategic alliances, and the expanding DeFi space. They’re at the forefront of promoting cross-chain interoperability, boosting transactional efficiency, and contributing to a safer, more inclusive digital financial environment, marking them as prime candidates for investment consideration. Investors should conduct detailed analyses and consider diversifying their portfolios to include these promising tokens. Such a calculated approach is vital for navigating the forthcoming wave of crypto advancements. With the scene set for a significant market evolution, the critical question for investors shifts from readiness to engage with these opportunities to contemplation of their future growth: Will these undervalued tokens reach their full investment potential as the cryptocurrency era progresses? Time will tell. Disclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

    "content": "Analysts from CryptoQuant have revealed that the influence of the 2024 Bitcoin halving on the price of BTC has notably diminished. According to the crypto analytics firm, the highly anticipated halving event is no longer the key driver for a bullish momentum in BTC. Bitcoin Halving Effects On Prices Is Fading CryptoQuant wrote in a recent research report that the upcoming Bitcoin halving event scheduled this April may not deliver the desired price shock expected by most crypto analysts and investors in the space. According to the analytics firm, the influence of the Bitcoin halving event has been dwindling over time, with the price of the cryptocurrency and a potential bullish rally being driven by a new change in market dynamics. Related Reading: VeChain On The Edge: Insider Says VET Will Reach The Finish Line Notably, CryptoQuant disclosed that the demand from long-term and large-scale investors, whales, has become one of the primary factors pushing the price of BTC upward. The Head of Research at CryptoQuant, Julio Monero disclosed on Tuesday, April 9, that the demand for Bitcoin from permanent holders has recently outpaced issuance for the first time in history. In its report, CryptoQuant also highlighted an 11% month-on-month increase in large-scale Bitcoin investors holding between 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, reaching unprecedented levels. This elevated demand is in sharp contrast with BTC’s supply dynamics and is poised to increase further after the halving event concludes. Currently, long-term Bitcoin holders are accumulating more tokens than the new investors entering the market. CryptoQuant revealed that permanent holders have also been adding as much as 200,000 BTC to their portfolio every month while long-term holders are amassing seven times more BTC per month. “We argue that the effect of the halving has been diminishing, as the new issuance of Bitcoin gets smaller relative to the amount of Bitcoin selling from long-term holders,” the analytics firm wrote. Analysts Remain Optimistic About Halving Influence Despite CryptoQuant’s report on Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamics, numerous analysts still expect a significant uptick in Bitcoin’s price following the halving event. Analysts like Joe Consorti have predicted BTC’s price to rise to $100,000 following the Bitcoin halving. Additionally, he has expressed optimism about a potential bullish rally for the cryptocurrency during this period. Related Reading: Solana Open Interest Drops $370 Million Amid Network Troubles, $200 Still Possible? Moreover, due to historical trends revealing a correlation between the Bitcoin halving event and a price surge for the cryptocurrency, various crypto investors have predicted a similar bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency this year. Recently, open interest in Bitcoin surged to new all-time highs above $18 billion. This increase suggests that traders and investors are still bullish on Bitcoin’s future value, seeing any price dips as buying opportunities before a potential rally.

    "content": "A pattern in the holdings of the Bitcoin long-term holders may suggest that the current bull run is 40% of the way to completion. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Distributing Recently In a new post on X, Glassnode lead analyst Checkmate discussed the recent behavior of the long-term Bitcoin holders. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) here refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins for over six months. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. Since the LTHs hold for significant periods, they are considered quite resolute. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whale Takes $52.3 Million In DOGE Off Binance, Sign Of Buying? And indeed, they display this resilience in their behavior, rarely selling despite whatever is happening in the broader market. As such, the times they sell are all the more noteworthy. Historically, the LTHs have taken to distribution during bull runs when the asset has broken its previous all-time high (ATH) price. Due to their long holding times, these investors amass large profits, which they start to spend when a high amount of demand comes in during bull rallies that happily take coins off their hands at high prices. Checkmate explained that the recent ATH break of the cryptocurrency has looked similar to any other past one, with the LTHs already having started spending for this round. The chart below shows the trend in the supply of Bitcoin LTHs over the past few years. The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent weeks | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin LTHs have recently observed their supply heading down. Remember that when it comes to increases in this metric, there is a delay associated with when buying is happening and when this supply is going up. This is natural because the newly bought coins must age for six months before they can be considered a part of the cohort’s holdings. When it comes to drawdowns, though, the same delay doesn’t emerge, as the age of the coins instantly resets back to zero, and they exit the group. Thus, the latest distribution from the LTHs is indeed happening. “In the prior two cycles, new demand for Bitcoin was able to absorb this LTH sell-side for around 6-8 months while pushing prices multiples higher,” explains the Glassnode lead. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) In Buy Zone That Earlier Led To 112% \u0026 87% Surges The chart below shows that the LTH supply has typically gone through a drawdown of around 14% during these bull run selloffs. The data for the drawdown in the LTH supply over the various cycles | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X Checkmate notes that, based on this historical average drawdown in the LTH supply, the current Bitcoin cycle would be around 40% completion for this process.

This bullish sentiment is backed by many traders, who are betting on a Bitcoin rally above $100,000, as per data shared by Greeks.Live. Bitcoin is already reacting positively to the growing bullish sentiment, as it crossed the $71,000 resistance for the first time in more than a month. Meanwhile, traders believe BTC remains one of the best cryptos to buy now, as the halving could fuel a rally above $100,000. NuggetRush (NUGX) Hits $3.75M, Gamers Back the Project for Early Success NuggetRush (NUGX) generated a lot of frenzy in its crypto ICO phase as it unveiled a one-of-a-kind gaming ecosystem. The NuggetRush game is built around the gold rush in a hyperrealistic virtual world where players are allowed to create their own NFT characters and assemble a team of miners as they go in search of gold and other precious minerals. The in-game rewards players find can be converted into rare popular NFTs, cash, and even real gold. The allure of NuggetRush’s reward system made it one of the hottest prospects. In addition to this, NuggetRush aims to extend its use into the real world via the novel impact gaming model. The NuggetRush team has announced that it will support poor artisanal miners residing in underdeveloped regions. This social impact model has made NuggetRush one of the top DeFi projects. NuggetRush was able to secure over $3.75 million in presale while selling over 270 million NUGX tokens. With the presale of NuggetRush sold out, the team is preparing for its airdrop, which is in just two weeks’ time. Following its airdrop and exchange listing at $0.02, NUGX has been forecasted to hit a price of $1.00, making it one of the best gaming tokens for every investor to buy right now. \u003e\u003e Buy NuggetRush Now \u003c\u003c Polkadot (DOT) Hit 600,000 Active Addresses Over the last few weeks, Polkadot (DOT) has been bustling with activity.

More than half of the active addresses were from Moonbeam, the popular cross-chain smart contract platform. The number of unique Polkadot non-zero balances has also been increasing, crossing $5.6 million. However, DOT has struggled over the past few weeks, dropping from $12.00 to its current range of $9.00. However, as we reenter a bull market, DOT has been predicted to top the $15.00 range, making it one of the best altcoins to buy. Closing Thoughts The options market shows that traders are optimistic about Bitcoin hitting $100,000 after halving. Meanwhile, the recent milestone signifies the recent growth in the Polkadot network, while NuggetRush is poised for significant growth in the coming months.

    "content": "A review of the trends of top crypto projects in the crypto industry shows that Solana (SOL) will be shutting its telegram bot called Solareum after suffering a notable breach that resulted in over $500,000 exploit. On the other hand, Polygon (MATIC) is looking to add another node to its zkEVM scaling protocol. Meanwhile, KangaMoon (KANG) is on course to reach a new milestone amid the consistent growth of the meme project’s presale. Solareum Trading Bot on Telegram to Seize Operation A trading bot that facilitates the trading of Solana-based tokens on Telegram, known as Solareum will be shut down. This is following a security breach that saw over $523,000 worth of Solana coins stolen from the user’s wallet on March 29th. Over 300 users are estimated to have fallen victim to the exploit. Responding to the breach on X, Solareum refuted the allegations from users, suggesting that they were responsible for the exploit. Meanwhile, the tweet admitted that there may be a chance that they got exploited prior to the drain. New Node Will be Added to Polygon (MATIC) zkEVM Out for Testing Polygon (MATIC) will be adding the cdk-erigon RPC node to its zkEVM mainnet in a move that is calculated to enhance the performance and sync times for the Polygon network. According to a tweet from Polygon Foundation on X, the integration of the cdk-erigon RPC node on the Polygon network will bring over 10x less disc space and 150x faster sync times. This development can be attributed to Polygon’s move to ensure a more steady network and less outage in the future. Currently, the RPC node is undergoing tests before its full implementation on the Polygon network. KangaMoon (KANG) Raises $4 Million in Overall Presale Funds as Project Enters Stage 5 Following the steady rise of the KangaMoon’s (KANG) presale, the top crypto coin has raised $4M so far in presale. With over 5,800 investors buying the KANG’s presale, the token has entered stage 5 of the presale. Notably, over 20,000 members have registered on the KangaMoon platform, making the project one of the top-performing projects on the blockchain. Meanwhile, the KANG token has generated over 290% ROI for early investors. At the current trajectory, the token is likely to see a 700% growth before the end of the presale. This makes KangaMoon one of the top crypto projects to invest in now. Meanwhile, the KANG token is sold for just $0.019 with a 10% deposit bonus attached. This represents cheap crypto with exponential growth potential. The team has announced plans to list the token in a major CEX exchange in Q2 and that has led to analysts projecting a 50x rally in the coming months. Meanwhile, members can earn the KANG token by engaging in KangaMoon’s social media campaigns. As a platform, KangaMoon facilitates the meeting and interaction of meme enthusiasts through the SocialFi structure. Similarly, the GameFi feature spices things up with its immersive play-to-earn gaming adventure that rewards players with NFTs, collectibles and the KANG token.

    "content": "On-chain data shows the recent Bitcoin drawdown has shaken up the short-term holders, leading them to make large exchange deposits at a loss. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Have Transferred Huge Volume In Loss To Exchanges As analyst James Van Straten pointed out in a post on X, the BTC short-term holders have recently participated in a large amount of loss-taking. The “short-term holders” (STHs) are the Bitcoin investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. The STHs make up one of the two main divisions of the BTC market, which is done on the basis of holding time, with the other cohort being known as the long-term holders (LTHs). Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders No Longer Extremely Greedy: Rebound Signal? Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the STHs would reflect the weak-minded side of the market, while the LTHs would be the persistent diamond hands. Given their fickle nature, the STHs usually easily react whenever a notable sector change occurs, like a price rally or crash. Recently, BTC has registered a significant drawdown, so these investors would likely have made some moves. Indeed, on-chain data would confirm this. Below is a Glassnode chart shared by Straten, which reveals the trend in the transfer volume in loss (in USD) going from the wallets of the STHs to centralized exchanges. The value of the metric appears to have been quite high in recent days | Source: @jvs_btc on X As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin short-term holders have recently deposited a large number of tokens holding a loss into exchange-affiliated wallets. Exchange inflows usually suggest demand for using the services these platforms provide, which can include selling. As these latest deposits from the STHs have come following a sharp drop in the price, it would appear possible that the panic-sellers indeed made these inflows. As the Bitcoin price is currently near the all-time high (ATH), most of the STH group would be holding a profit. So, all this loss volume can only come from those who bought at the recent highs. This isn’t the first time the market has observed such quick capitulation from FOMO buyers this year. The chart shows that the exchange transfer volume in loss from the STHs also spiked very high during the plunge that followed the latest price ATH. The spike back then was even greater in scale than the one witnessed recently and suggested the shakeout of the holders who the news of the ATH had driven in.

    "content": "Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, thinks the U.S. government’s decision to sell some of the Bitcoin (BTC) it has acquired through seizures might be good for long-term hodlers, investors who keep their tokens long-term to profit off its value appreciation. Back’s comments come after reports revealed the U.S. government started selling some of the 30,000 BTC it seized from the Silk Road sting. He points out that government sales could lead to more dollars being printed, pushing the value of BTC higher. BTC is once again poised to surge after breaking the $71,000 resistance level and holding above it for the second time since an all-time high (ATH) was set at $73,750. Investors investing in BTC ETFs have been one of the main driving forces pushing Bitcoin to new highs. Emerging crypto InQubeta (QUBE) is one of the top ICOs going on as its presale has brought in over $13.3 million. InQubeta has now raised more than top DeFi projects like Solana (SOL), proving it could compete with the top ten cryptocurrencies when launched. Experts Dub InQubeta (QUBE) the Best Defi Crypto to Buy in 2024 InQubeta seeks to create a decentralized ecosystem where anyone can easily invest in artificial intelligence (AI) startups. Its ecosystem is intended to operate as an alternative to mainstream investment firms for people who can’t meet the income or net worth requirements often associated with these firms. There are also over 1.4 billion people who don’t have access to banking services, which means they can’t use traditional investment services even if they qualify. InQubeta will redefine how AI investments work by using a crowdfunding protocol to create a network where anyone can invest in artificial intelligence startups. Here’s how InQubeta’s developers expect the ecosystem to work: AI startups that are eligible to use InQubeta’s crowdfunding space get access to its marketplace where users can create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) These startups use these tokens to digitize any investment opportunities they have to sell to investors on the marketplace. The authenticity of each token can be verified easily on the blockchain’s history, so there’s no way to duplicate them Fractionalization enables investors to purchase small fractions of these tokens/investment opportunities with QUBE to suit their budgets. Like stocks, these tokens increase in value as their makers expand their market capitalizations InQubeta’s investment space provides investors with lots of liquidity since any tokens purchased can be easily resold. Investing in AI isn’t the only route to generational wealth on the InQubeta network. QUBE hodlers are positioned for tremendous gains since analysts predict prices will surge as much as 10,000% once listed on exchanges. QUBE sells for $0.028 today but could be valued at over $2 before the year ends. Adam Back Believes U.S. Government Selling Seized BTC Could Have a Positive Effect While Adam Back believes the recent sales of large sums of BTC by the U.S. government could have a positive effect on the market, some analysts have different perspectives. Some wonder about the government’s motives behind these sales, including possibly trying to suppress BTC’s price. The launch of spot exchange-traded funds highlights how market dynamics can be affected by governments as the new asset class is responsible for billions streaming into the Bitcoin market. The government selling large amounts of BTC could increase volatility in the market as it absorbs the new supply. EOS (EOS) Has Surged 7% in the Past Seven Days EOS offers its users a high-performance blockchain that runs on the EOS virtual machine. It competes with the Ethereum network as one of the most programmable digital currencies around. EOS’s price could surge as much as 14x if Bitcoin enjoys the exponential growth many analysts expect. Summary EOS, BTC, and QUBE are three of the top cryptos to invest in right now. While BTC has enjoyed the most growth, QUBE and EOS could outgrow it this year. QUBE is expected to surge as much as 100x, while the most growth BTC investors can expect at this point is about 2x.

    "content": "The Bitcoin price has somewhat slowed down since reaching the unprecedented high of $73,000, moving mostly sideways since mid-March. However, with the halving event less than a fortnight away, all eyes will be on the premier cryptocurrency and all that pertains to it over the next couple of weeks. According to a recent on-chain observation, the BTC supply on exchanges has been on a steady decline over the past few months. This trend has sparked discussions on what this could mean for the Bitcoin price, both in the short and long term. $7.55 Billion Transferred Out Of Exchange Wallets In The Past Month Prominent crypto pundit Ali Martinez took to the X platform to share that a significant amount of Bitcoin has been moved out of crypto exchanges over the past month. The relevant metric here is Glassnode’s Balance on Exchanges, which tracks the total amount of a cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this case) held across all exchange addresses. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Go On 1.2 Million BTC Buying Spree, Is Retail Finally Here? A decrease in the value of this indicator implies that investors are making more withdrawals than deposits of Bitcoin into centralized exchanges. The metric’s increase, on the other hand, indicates that more BTC is flowing into these exchanges than leaving. Chart showing Bitcoin balance on all exchanges | Source: Ali_charts/X According to Martinez, about 111,000 BTC (worth approximately $7.55 billion) have been transferred out of known crypto exchange wallets in the past month. Typically, an exodus of funds (of this magnitude) suggests a significant shift in the sentiment of Bitcoin investors. While the exact rationale behind such a massive movement of Bitcoin remains unclear, the flow of funds from trading platforms suggests a growth in investor confidence. This implies that BTC owners are more interested in holding their assets in the long term rather than selling for short-term gains. Furthermore, this continuous downward trend in BTC’s balance on exchanges could set the stage for a bullish rally for the Bitcoin price. A sustained drop in the BTC’s supply on centralized exchanges could result in a supply crunch – a scenario where the supply of a particular asset is lower than its demand, leading to a surge in its value. Another potential bullish catalyst for the Bitcoin price is the upcoming halving event, which is expected to occur on April 18, 2024. With the miners’ rewards slashed in half and the production of Bitcoin slowed, this event is expected to impact the value of BTC positively. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at around $69,537, reflecting a 2.7% increase in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Breakout Of The Year?

At spot rates, BTC is down roughly 11% from 2024 peaks and struggling to generate sufficient buying pressure, looking at the formation in the daily chart. Will History Support Bitcoin And Rally To Fresh Highs? Taking to X, the analyst highlights historical price patterns using the 2-week Fisher Transform indicator, a tool for picking out potential reversal zones like double tops or bottoms.

Fisher transform indicator on BTC | Source: Analyst on X By the end of 2022, Bitcoin had fallen to as low as $16,000, accelerated by the collapse of FTX and the bankruptcy of several other popular crypto hedge funds, including Three Arrow Capital (3AC). The analyst also emphasizes the importance of the indicator in differentiating between a double top, mirroring 2017 and 2021, and a potential single peak later this year. Bitcoin prices trending sideways on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView Presently, the trader said prices are approaching 2017 levels. Then, prices created what the analyst described as a “more subtle initial rise” before peaking six months later at over $20,000. If this leads, and the indicator “pauses” where it is, Bitcoin will likely record a “single top.” However, only time will tell where this top will be at. Hedge Funds Were Selling At Tops? This prediction comes amid significant bearish bets by leveraged hedge funds. Data from the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) reveals that these funds held record “short” positions in Bitcoin futures contracts by last week. Observers note this was the largest short position since 2017, at over 16,000 contracts. By shorting, they expected prices to dump, which is precisely what’s happening at spot rates.

However, even as hedge funds short, another analyst, responding to the trend, said the futures premium remained high. This is a development that some of these crypto hedge funds are taking advantage of. The number of shorts could increase in the days ahead as United States Federal Reserve officials appeared to be hawkish and upbeat economic data started pouring in. Being a data-driven central bank, the Federal Reserve might not slash rates as fast as initially projected.

Via a statement on X, Edwards pointed to PENDLE, a token operating within the DeFi space, citing its exceptional total value locked (TVL) and market cap as primary indicators of its undervaluation. “Perhaps the most undervalued alt right now is PENDLE.

Since the start of January, PENDLE has seen a remarkable 590% increase in price, with a 220% spike in just the last four weeks alone, making it one of the top-performing assets in the broader cryptocurrency market. This surge aligns with a significant rise in Pendle’s TVL, which escalated from just under $240 million at the beginning of January to over $4.6 billion recently. Related Reading: “Where It Should Be”: Crypto Analyst Remains Firm On $1.7 Prediction For Cardano (ADA) Delving into the reasons behind PENDLE’s impressive trajectory, crypto researcher 100y.eth offered a detailed explanation on X, focusing on the token’s distinct utilities and tokenomics. “Pendle Finance revolutionizes DeFi by allowing the tokenization and separation of yield-bearing tokens into PT (Principal) and YT (Yield), tradable on Pendle’s AMM. This innovation is at the core of Pendle’s current popularity,” the researcher stated. Further shedding light on the factors driving PENDLE’s accumulation, 100y.eth referred to significant whale activity. “According to lookonchain, whales are still in the phase of accumulating PENDLE, a testament to their belief in its long-term value,” the researcher noted, citing substantial withdrawals from exchanges as indicative of investor confidence. Whales continue to accumulate $PENDLE! 0xe675 withdrew 295,443 $PENDLE($1.95M) from #Binance 3 hours ago and 372,752 $PENDLE ($2.46M) from #Binance 3 days ago. 0xAa4c withdrew 115,500 $PENDLE($764K) from #Binance 30 mins ago and 384,500 $PENDLE($2.54M) from #Binance 4 days ago.… pic.twitter.com/w1MZTUHSZp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 10, 2024 The essence of PENDLE’s appeal lies in its vePENDLE system, which enhances its governance model and incentivizes long-term holding. “Magic resides in vePENDLE. By locking PENDLE, users receive vePENDLE, engaging more deeply with the ecosystem. This mechanism not only fosters community governance but also amplifies rewards for liquidity providers,” the researcher added.

    "content": "Data shows Bitcoin is currently nearing two notable on-chain price levels. Here’s what happened the last time BTC broke above them. Bitcoin Is Approaching Vaulted Price \u0026 MVRV +1SD Currently In a new post on X, Glassnode leads on-chain analyst Checkmate points out that BTC has been near two on-chain price levels recently. The first of these levels is the “MVRV +1SD.” The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is a famous indicator for Bitcoin. In short, it compares the value that BTC holders are currently carrying (that is, the market cap) against the value they put into the cryptocurrency (the realized cap). Related Reading: Bitcoin 40% Of Way Through Bull Run If This Metric Is To Go By This metric is generally used to determine the scale of profit or loss that the market as a whole is carrying right now. Based on this, the fairness of the coin’s price may be judged. In the context of the current discussion, the +1 standard deviation (SD) of the MVRV ratio from its mean is of relevance. More specifically, the price level at which the market would satisfy this MVRV ratio condition is of focus. The other on-chain level of interest here is the “Vaulted Price.” This indicator is a product of the “Cointime Economics” framework that Checkmate came up with alongside David Puell from Ark Invest. In reference to this metric, the paper reads: Vaulted Realized Price may be considered to be a pricing level that reflects the ‘potential energy’ stored in the system. Somewhat counter-intuitively, the more long-term coin accumulation that takes place, the larger the uncertainty becomes between the proportion of truly lost vs. HODLed supply. Vaulted Realized Price will trade lower in this instance, as more cointime accumulation takes place, and uncertainty regarding future distributive pressure builds (and vice-versa). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in these two indicators, as well as some other “original” on-chain levels, over the past few years: Looks like the asset has been near these two levels in recent weeks | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin spot price earlier broke through the Vaulted Price and went to the MVRV +1SD (note that the labeling is flipped in the chart by mistake, as Checkmate has noted in reply to the post). Since then, the price has come down a bit and is trading under both of these levels. Nonetheless, it currently stands quite near to them and far above the other on-chain price levels like the realized price.

Obviously, what followed then was the bull run of 2021. It remains to be seen how Bitcoin’s interactions with these levels will be this time around and whether a similar euphoric run will follow with a potential break above them. BTC Price Bitcoin had shot up above the $72,000 mark earlier, but it has since slumped back again, and it’s now floating around $69,000.

    "content": "Over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to move significantly to the upside as the leading cryptocurrency has entered a consolidation phase below the $69,000 mark. This subdued volatility departs from Bitcoin’s usual fluctuations, raising speculation about a potential stagnation phase in its market trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Roar: Analysts Predict Surge To $82,000 Amid Bullish Pennant Formation Anticipation Builds For Bitcoin’s Next Rally The cryptocurrency community has closely monitored Bitcoin’s movements, especially as it approaches crucial resistance levels. Insights from prominent crypto analyst Captain Faibik shed light on Bitcoin’s current outlook. Captain Faibik suggests that Bitcoin could be on the brink of a significant breakout, contingent upon surpassing the $70,000 resistance threshold. According to the crypto analyst, the BTC “Bulls must Clear the $70,000 Resistance area to Confirm the upside Breakout.” $BTC is Bouncing back Nicely but still Consolidating within the Triangle. Bulls must Clear the 70k Resistance area to Confirm the upside Breakout.#Crypto #Bitcoin #BTC pic.twitter.com/NxAz8Y1ktq — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) April 5, 2024 Another crypto analyst, Jelle, Echoes similar sentiments and emphasizes the importance of patience among investors, particularly with the impending Bitcoin halving event on the horizon. Notably, the Halving is a pre-programmed event built into the Bitcoin protocol that occurs approximately every four years within the Bitcoin network to reduce the reward for mining new BTC blocks. Despite Bitcoin’s recent consolidation, anticipation for a potential rally above the $70,000 mark continues to build within the crypto community, especially as the halving is now less than 20 days away. This is because the halving ultimately decreases the supply of new BTC, and reduced supply often leads to increased demand and speculative buying. Hope For Bitcoin Bull Run Jelle’s analysis underscores the historical precedent of Bitcoin’s price movements, noting that previous all-time highs were often preceded by periods of consolidation and uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin Teeters On The Edge Of Glory: Will It Smash The $70,000 Resistance? Drawing attention to bullish indicators such as the pennant formation and strong support levels, Jelle predicts a breakout in the coming weeks, providing hope for investors seeking upward momentum in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. While #Bitcoin did not break $69,000 in one go, it looks like it’s forming a new higher low here. Hold $66,500, and we’ll be at $69k again soon. Be patient – the halving is approaching fast. pic.twitter.com/LgMjodV4mF — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) April 5, 2024 Meanwhile, current market data indicates a favorable environment for retail traders, with Glassnode reporting increased Bitcoin accumulation by short-term holders since December 2023.

    "content": "Ripple’s XRP has been treading water with a modest gain of around 2% in the last day, yet its year-to-date performance lags at a decrease of 1.96%. This performance highlights a tepid market response, stirring investor concerns regarding the future viability of XRP and its chances of reaching the coveted $1 threshold in 2024. Elsewhere, InsanityBets has already posted 50% gains and looks set to continue its rise from $0.0015 to $0.018 during its presale. This is a great opportunity to buy into a presale early, with huge gains still on offer! XRP’s Momentum Shifts After Overcoming Key Resistance Following a period of sideways movement, XRP’s value saw a dramatic upturn, surging by 20.44% in a matter of hours. This rally was short-lived, as it faced a setback at a resistance point of $0.7310, leading to a retreat influenced by bearish trends. The downturn saw XRP retract by 20.65%, dipping to a low of $0.580 before the market dynamics shifted in favor of the bulls. This shift allowed XRP to surpass a critical resistance level, briefly consolidating before market volatility intensified, leading to a further adjustment. Despite a subsequent 10.26% correction, Ripple’s price found stability, moving sideways momentarily. The landscape soon changed as bullish forces reclaimed strength, propelling XRP past a significant resistance marker and hinting at a positive market sentiment for the cryptocurrency sector. Indicators Point Toward a Bullish Outlook for XRP The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator presents a sustained green histogram, signaling a bullish outlook for XRP. The rising averages further support the possibility of continued value appreciation in the near future. Future Trajectory of XRP’s Price Should the market sustain XRP above the $0.60 support threshold, it’s anticipated that the bulls will challenge the $0.63 resistance level within the week. Holding at this juncture could pave the way for an assault on the higher resistance mark of $0.69 in the weeks to follow. However, a reversal in trend could see Ripple’s momentum wane, potentially revisiting the $0.60 support line. A bearish dominance would risk a further slide, positioning XRP to approach the lower support boundary of $0.58 shortly. In this dynamic landscape, Ripple’s XRP stands at a crossroads, with its potential to reach $1 hinging on its ability to navigate market fluctuations and maintain upward momentum. Why InsanityBet Will Outperform Ripple in 2024 InsanityBets revolutionizes the crypto casino sector with its unique focus on rewarding users. By redistributing 85% of platform fees and 90% of house profits directly to token holders, it guarantees a consistent return on investment, even if they lose their bet.

Priced attractively at $0.0015 with a market capitalization of $7.5 million, InsanityBets presents a substantial profit potential, promising significant rewards for a minimal market share capture. The token will rise from $0.0015 to $0.018 during the presale, so buy now! InsanityBets is here – check the website out and buy before the price rises. Disclaimer: This is a paid release.

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Recovery Rally: Breaking Through This Level Is Key To Bullish Momentum – Analyst Catalyst That Could Drive Bitcoin To $200,000 According to Tapiero, a significant macroeconomic factor is expected to drive Bitcoin’s price to new heights, offering investors an opportunity for substantial gains. Tapiero’s bullish stance on Bitcoin’s future price trajectory revolves around a unique correlation he observed in the market. Particularly, the expert highlighted concerns about “monetary debasement” driven by a notable 60% increase in the Treasury market over the past five years. This factor leads Tapiero to anticipate a surge beyond $200,000 for the digital gold, Bitcoin. While acknowledging the potential for gold to perform well in such a scenario, Tapiero remains particularly bullish on Bitcoin’s prospects.

With a 2.6% increase over the week and a 3.1% surge in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s upward trajectory continues to attract attention from investors and analysts alike. BTC price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart.

This significant development, as illuminated by Greek Live, carries a notional value of up to $45 million, with $8.5 million worth of premiums alone. Greeks Live further reported that this occurrence has propelled the entire market into a prolonged bullish momentum. In addition, with the halving event on the horizon, the prospect of reaching new all-time highs, including the milestone of $100,000, appears to be within reach. Bitcoin broke through the $70,000 zone without warning, one step away from a new all-time high.

    "content": "After a relatively stable period, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has slightly disappointed meme coin enthusiasts over the past week. After a period of solid growth, $DOGE experienced a drop in value, and now, unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like such a good option anymore. Although $DOGE has witnessed a price drop in the last seven days, crypto users hope that the situation could turn around and this meme coin could return to its old ways thanks to the upcoming Doge Day. However, everything points to the fact that another dog-themed meme coin will achieve much greater success with Doge Day approaching. It is the young Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20). This fresh meme coin has recorded astonishing results from the very start. Experts believe its peak will happen right after Doge Day, which is its launch day! \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy The Best Crypto Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Dogecoin ($DOGE) sees a significant weekly price drop while interest in its fresh alternative grows! Meme coin enthusiasts have eagerly awaited Doge Day and the Bitcoin Halving, believing that this is when Dogecoin ($DOGE) could shine! However, this positive sentiment towards Dogecoin has decreased dramatically over the past seven days, as $DOGE has experienced a price drop. Meme coin enthusiasts are now interested in what could happen with Dogecoin in the coming period. Will $DOGE continue last week’s downward trend, or is there still a possibility that this meme coin could bring joy to investors? Crypto influencer Trader Tardigrade believes that Dogecoin could pull itself out of this situation and reach a value of $2, $9, or even $40. Rekt Capital is not so optimistic about this meme coin and believes that in the best case, $DOGE could rally towards $0.30. But, to get a better perspective, let’s see what price predictions suggest for this meme coin for 2024. MONTH MINIMUM PRICE MAXIMUM PRICE APRIL $0.158 $0.187 MAY $0.143 $0.169 JUNE $0.139 $0.153 JULY $0.125 $0.153 AUGUST $0.116 $0.116 SEPTEMBER $0.101 $0.164 OCTOBER $0.0785 $0.157 NOVEMBER $0.0901 $0.0983 DECEMBER $0.0892 $0.0985 As you can see, the predictions for Dogecoin ($DOGE) for 2024 are not overly optimistic. Despite the hopes of meme coin enthusiasts, $DOGE will not be able to achieve any significant results this year. However, a new meme coin star has emerged in the meme coin community, causing quite a buzz. Dogeocin20 ($DOGE), a cryptocurrency generating significant interest as its launch day approaches, is capturing the spotlight. Let’s explore if this coin has the potential to outshine $DOGE and other popular meme coins. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Dogecoin20 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Crypto users focus on a new meme coin star, Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20)! The popular Dogecoin ($DOGE) may not be able to achieve any significant results during 2024, but the young meme coin star Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) could do so. The era of dog-themed meme coins is not over, and the $DOGE20 success so far speaks in favor of that. However, we should not ignore that Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) is not an ordinary dog-themed meme coin but a crypto that carries real utility and provides its investors with many opportunities. The opportunity to win staking rewards is particularly attractive to investors. Early investors are in the best position regarding staking rewards, so this is probably one of the reasons why Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) experienced such initial success. In record time, the Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) completed its presale with over $10 million raised, but users’ interest stayed the same even after that. As the launch day approaches, more and more crypto users notice the progress of this meme coin, become aware of its potential, and strive to grab it as soon as possible. If you missed investing in this meme coin during the presale, you will be glad to hear you have another chance to place this young meme coin star in your crypto portfolio! \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Dogecoin20 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c As launch day approaches, Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) surges and becomes increasingly popular! Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) has already earned the epithet “the best meme coin to buy now,” which is undoubtedly one of the factors that made it so desirable. However, even though the presale has ended, investors want to use this last chance to buy $DOGE20 at a unique price of only $0.00022 because they know this meme coin could bring them a lot. Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) launches on Doge Day, so hurry and invest in this 100x potential meme coin immediately! \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Dogecoin20 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Conclusion The fact that the “original” Dogecoin ($DOGE) experienced a significant drop in value last week does not mean that the meme coin mania is over. It does not even mean that the interest in dog-themed meme coins has decreased, and the growing hype around Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) speaks in support of that! As Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) prepares to launch on Doge Day, the clock is ticking for those who want to seize this last chance to buy this meme coin at a great price! If you failed to get Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) during the presale, do your best to correct that mistake and use the chance to grab it for just $0.00022.

Bitcoin Might Be Poised For New Peak This Month Bitcoin is presently exhibiting a downward pressure on low timeframes, falling to the $65,000 price level after briefly touching $71,000 on Monday.

As a result, Captain Faibik has set his price target around the $88,000 and $90,000 threshold this month. The post read: BTC Bullish pennant formation on the 12hrs timeframe Chart. Expecting an upside Breakout later this Week. In case of a Successful Breakout, Bitcoin might hit $88,000-$90,000 this month. The expert has also confirmed that the bullish pennant developed on the daily timeframe chart. Thus, the analyst is optimistic that the breakout will materialize soon. The analyst has also identified some buying pressure on low timeframes, triggering momentum for the crypto asset. “BTC Bulls are defending the 4-hour Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 200 around $65,600 and bullish pennant also in play,” he stated. However, for the Bitcoin bulls to regain momentum, they must reclaim the critical resistance level of $70,000. This suggests the bulls still have more work to do to reach the resistance level. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $66,125, with a decline of over 5% in the past 7 days. Its trading volume has plummeted by nearly 9% in the past day, while its market cap is slightly up by 0.81%. Possible Correction On The Downtrend While Faibik anticipates a recovery, some analysts are pessimistic about the asset’s movement and express worries about a potential pullback. One of the crypto experts who predicted a further correction in BTC is The Fomo Factory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flash Crash Washes Out 81,000 Crypto Traders For Over $220 Million The expert discussed possible outcomes and provided several worrying price targets for the coin. According to the analyst, Bitcoin could drop to $60,000, representing strong support, and to the $52,000 and $56,000 Fibonacci retracement line. The analyst further cautions against discounting a more significant retrace to the $48,000 and $42,000 region. This prediction casts a shady ground for the largest cryptocurrency asset as the Bitcoin halving event approaches. However, given the previous impact on the coin’s price, there is hope for a rally in the short term.

    "content": "New listings often spark excitement and speculation among investors, driving significant price movements. Two tokens that have garnered attention in recent times are Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Option2Trade (O2T). As these tokens navigate the complexities of the crypto market, the prospect of new listings raises the question: Will they propel Shiba Inu (SHIB) and O2T to the coveted $1 mark? Let’s delve into the dynamics of these tokens and assess their potential for reaching this milestone. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Riding the Listing Wave Shiba Inu (SHIB) has established itself as a prominent player in the meme coin space, drawing inspiration from its namesake, the Shiba Inu dog breed. With a vibrant community and widespread popularity, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen significant price movements in response to listing announcements on various cryptocurrency exchanges. The prospect of new listings often fuels bullish sentiment among SHIB investors, as it opens up access to a broader market and increases liquidity. As SHIB continues to ride the listing wave, investors are hopeful that these developments will propel its price towards $1.

The prospect of new listings for O2T presents an opportunity for the token to gain further exposure and attract new investors, potentially driving its price towards the $1 mark. The Impact of New Listings New listings have the potential to have a significant impact on the price trajectory of cryptocurrencies. When tokens are listed on popular exchanges, they gain access to a larger pool of investors and increased trading volume, which can lead to price appreciation. For tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Option2Trade (O2T), new listings represent an opportunity to expand their reach and increase market liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell these assets. As anticipation builds around potential listings for Shiba Inu (SHIB) and O2T, investors are closely monitoring developments in the crypto market for signs of bullish momentum that could push these tokens towards $1. Market Sentiment and Speculation Market sentiment plays a crucial role in driving price movements in the cryptocurrency market. Positive news and developments, such as new listings, often fuel bullish sentiment among investors, leading to increased buying activity and upward price pressure. As speculation mounts around the potential for Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Option2Trade (O2T) to reach $1, investors are closely watching market trends and analyst predictions for clues on future price movements.

While achieving this milestone may require sustained bullish momentum and broader market adoption, investors remain optimistic about the future prospects of SHIB and O2T.

    "content": "In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, new contenders constantly emerge, seeking to disrupt established players and claim their slice of the market pie. One such newcomer making waves is Hump (HUMP), a small-cap token that has skyrocketed in value since its recent launch. With its meteoric rise, Hump has garnered attention as it sets its sights on challenging established giants like Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (MATIC) in the coming years. The Rise of Hump: A Meteoric Ascent Hump’s ascent to prominence has been extraordinary, defying expectations and redefining the possibilities within the cryptocurrency landscape. Since its inception, Hump has charted an unprecedented trajectory of growth, experiencing an astonishing increase of over 5400% in just one week. At present, Hump trades at $0.01213, reflecting a remarkable 24-hour surge of 34.54%. With a market cap currently standing at $82.52 million, Hump has already made a significant impact on the market. However, industry experts foresee even greater achievements on the horizon, predicting that Hump could soar past the $1 billion mark within the next two weeks. This rapid ascent underscores the immense potential of Hump as it continues to captivate investors and carve out its place as a formidable player in the cryptocurrency space. Market Dynamics: ADA and MATIC Under Pressure The success of Hump can be attributed, in part, to the frustrations experienced by ADA and MATIC holders. Despite being established projects with promising fundamentals, both Cardano and Polygon have failed to deliver substantial returns to investors. Over the past year, Polygon has seen a decline of 21.78%, while Cardano has struggled to achieve a mere 30% increase in value. In contrast, Hump’s explosive growth has captured the attention of disillusioned investors, leading them to explore alternative investment opportunities in small-cap tokens like Hump. Hump’s Unique Value Proposition What sets Hump apart from other tokens is its unique positioning within the market. Positioned as the “Solana meme coin superstar,” Hump embodies a spirit of innovation and inclusivity that resonates with a diverse audience of crypto enthusiasts. With its adorable furry mascot and vibrant community, Hump transcends the realm of mere meme tokens, positioning itself as a symbol of progress and empowerment in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The Power of Community: Building Momentum A key factor driving Hump’s success is its strong community support. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that rely solely on market dynamics, Hump leverages the collective power of its community to drive adoption and growth. Through social media engagement, online forums, and community events, Hump has cultivated a loyal following of supporters who are passionate about its mission and vision. Listing on Centralized Exchanges: Expanding Accessibility Hump’s imminent listing on centralised exchanges (CEX) is expected to further boost its visibility and accessibility to a wider audience of investors. As more traders flock to Hump in search of lucrative returns, the token’s market dominance is likely to expand, posing a direct threat to the market share of Cardano and Polygon. With increased liquidity and trading volume, Hump is poised to solidify its position as a major player in the cryptocurrency market. Hump’s Roadmap: Charting the Course Ahead Looking ahead, Hump has ambitious plans to solidify its position in the cryptocurrency market. With a total supply of 6,900,000,000 tokens, Hump is well-positioned to disrupt the Solana meme coin scene and redefine the parameters of success in the crypto galaxy. By continuing to innovate and engage with its community, Hump aims to establish itself as a leading force in the world of decentralized finance, driving positive change and empowering individuals worldwide. Conclusion: A New Era Dawns Hump’s remarkable ascent signals a paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency landscape, with small-cap tokens like Hump poised to challenge the dominance of established players like Cardano and Polygon. As Hump continues to gain momentum and market share, ADA and MATIC may face challenges in retaining their position, potentially experiencing a decline in value as investors flock to alternative investment opportunities. With its innovative vision and passionate community, Hump represents more than just a token—it’s a symbol of progress and empowerment in the evolving world of decentralized finance. As we look towards the future, Hump stands as a beacon of hope, ushering in a new era of opportunity and possibility in the crypto galaxy.

    "content": "Investors and analysts are trying to predict Cardano’s (ADA) price’s future performance. As the price continues to show red numbers, a top crypto analyst considers that ADA is “right where it should be.” Related Reading: ADA Price Ready To Soar As Cardano Network Hits New 88.6 Million Transaction Milestone Cardano Loses 10th Spot Against Telegram’s Toncoin Cardano’s recent spotlight has highlighted its disappointing price performance and lack of appeal for traders. Despite its technology and strong community, the ecosystem lacks the activity and demand of other chains like Solana. Recently, Charles Hoskinson defended the project, stating that “Cardano always wins,” referencing a poll ranking the best Layer-1 networks. Moreover, Hoskinson took another jab at Solana’s network problem after its recent transaction failure rate reached 75%. Nonetheless, on Tuesday, ADA lost its spot in the top ten cryptocurrencies after being flipped by Toncoin (TON). According to CoinGecko data, Cardano’s market capitalization of $20.1 billion was surpassed by TON’s $23.3 billion market cap. As a result, ADA’s spot as the 10th largest cryptocurrency by this metric was taken by TON. ADA drops to be the 11th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Source: CoinGecko Per CoinMarketCap data, ADA remains in the top ten cryptocurrencies, ranking ninth on the website’s list before being flipped. ADA Is “Where It Should Be” Last week, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that ADA’s whale activity was “experiencing a lull.” To the analyst, whether this was a signal of further price consolidation or a drop remained to be seen. Some believe that TON’s overtaking of Cardano’s place on the list highlights some of the ecosystem’s problems. Martinez reiterated his prediction made around the time Bitcoin registered its latest all-time high (ATH) of $73,373. At the time, the analyst considered that ADA resembled the pattern observed from 2018 to 2021. During the period observed by Martinez, Cardano’s token went through a long consolidation period, with the price hovering between $0.026 and $0.082. After breaking out of this resistance level, ADA’s price surged to $0.35 in the following weeks before continuing its upward trajectory to its ATH of $3.09. According to the analyst, if that fractal continued during the following weeks, investors should “anticipate ADA consolidating in the $0.55 to $0.80 range. This would be followed by a surge to the $1.7 support level. After another consolidation period, the stage would be set for the token’s price to “breakout to $5,” the analyst considered. ADA’s price prediction and potential for fresh gains. Source: Ali Martinez on X Almost a month later, the analyst considers that “nothing has changed for Cardano.” Martinez reaffirmed the price consolidation between the $0.55-$0.80 range and subsequent breakout, as “ADA is exactly where it should be.” Despite the analyst’s optimistic forecast, ADA’s price of $0.5762 remains 81.5% below its 2021 ATH. At writing time, the token dropped 5.4% from the previous day. Additionally, its performance has decreased by 3.6% and 22.3% in the weekly and monthly timeframes. However, the token’s market activity has surged 6.6% in the last 24 hours, with a daily trading volume of $502.1 million.

    "content": "The crypto industry is an ever-evolving industry where new projects ascend to dominance and make investors millionaires within a short time. Currently, a top crypto project is in the ascendancy and looking to oust top meme coins like Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Pepe, etc. The meme project, which is still at its presale stage, is showcasing exponential growth potential that is capable of turning its investors into millionaires within a year. This meme coin is no other than KangaMoon (KANG). Here, you’ll find an in-depth analysis of the KANG project and why experts believe it will become the next blue-chip crypto. KangaMoon (KANG) Sets Blueprint for a Massive Meme Empire KangaMoon (KANG) is coming into the crypto industry armed with a strategic investment groundwork that’ll trump most of the top meme coins in the market, including Shiba Inu. For context, KangaMoon is setting up one of the biggest meme platforms that will act as a meeting place for meme enthusiasts. The KangaMoon platform has two standout features which include the SocialFi structure and the GameFi feature. Through the SocialFi structure, meme enthusiasts can meet and interact with like-minds on the Kangaverse. On the other hand, the GameFi feature facilitates a play-to-earn environment where members can journey through the gaming adventure while earning valuable rewards that include NFTs, collectibles, and KANG tokens. It’s no wonder then that over 20,000 meme enthusiasts have already joined the platform. While still in its presale phase, the KangaMoon project has already recorded an ROI of 290%.. There’s more growth to come for KANG, given that the token is set to hit CEX exchanges in Q2. As such, investing in the KANG presale for only $0.0196 is the best strategy to position oneself for the massive exponential growth potential. Crypto experts have projected 100x rallies in the coming months. That means the KANG price could hit $1 sooner than anticipated. Overall, KangaMoon is an emerging meme project that will serve as both a profitable investment venture for traders as well as an entertaining platform for meme enthusiasts on the blockchain. Accessing the Shiba Inu Project and Why KangaMoon May Outshine it Shiba Inu (SHIB) was one of the best meme coins in the meme coin market when it was launched in August 2020. The Ethereum-based token is the second most valued meme coin by market capitalization according to market stats. However, unlike KangaMoon, the Shiba Inu token harbors no significant utility. Meanwhile, the KANG token is a utility token of an emerging, high-potential KangaMoon meme platform. The KangaMoon platform is also an upgraded version of Shiba Inu’s Shibarium metaverse. This is because while the Shibarium metaverse allows members to interact and earn in-game rewards, it doesn’t rely entirely on the Shiba Inu token, as members can easily boycott the token in favor of ETH to make transactions. This lowers the utility of the SHIB token. Meanwhile, KANG remains the only utility token of the Kangaverse, a development that will increase the value of KANG over time.

    "content": "Ethereum Layer-2 solutions to hit $1 trillion in market cap by 2023 based on data from investment manager VanEck. According to the report, they can capitalize on Ethereum’s primary challenge, its limited capacity to process, store and compute data. Two of the largest scaling solutions include Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP), which have seen solid price performance as-well. However, another project built on Ethereum is also rising, and that’s KangaMoon (KANG) which spiked 290%. Today, we will go over their price performance to see how far they can rise, and to see which will be one of the top DeFi projects. KangaMoon (KANG) Up 290% KangaMoon (KANG) can experience a remarkable level of growth as it has already begun to dominate the charts following its monumental rise in value from $0.005 to $0.0196 marking a 290% increase. It’s also raised over $4.3 million and can raise $4.7 million during the week. The key reason for this massive momentum is because the crypto goes beyond the classic trope of meme coins and introduces a vast ecosystem that rewards players with massive token utility. On top of the platform, there is a Play-to-Earn (P2E) element, coupled with Social-Fi features and a community-driven approach. Players can create their own KangaMoon character and through it, can enter tournaments, fights, or even place bets on battles in order to get rewards in the form of KANG tokens or NFTs. In fact, there are now over 5,800 KANG holders, and the community has over 20,000 registered users. Based on the latest analyst projections, the crypto can spike 100x following its launch, making it one of the top DeFi projects. Arbitrum (ARB) to Spike to $2.32 by the End of Q4, 2024 Arbitrum (ARB) has displayed a price correction phase in the short-term, where it dipped 30.3% in the past 30 days. However, the year-to-date (YTD) climb for the Arbitrum price was by 24%, and during the past week, it moved up from $1.44 to $1.69. If the Layer-2 solutions for Ethereum do hit $1 trillion in market cap, the Arbitrum crypto has massive growth potential, and could soon regain significant bullish attention. According to the Arbitrum price prediction, it can end 2024 at $2.32. Optimism (OP) to Reach $5.50 by the End of the Year Optimism (OP) is another Layer-2 scaling solution which showcased a year-to-date (YTD) growth of 43%. Moreover, during the previous week, the Optimism price spiked from a low point of $3.02 to $3.79, and at this rate, it is closer towards breaking the $4 price barrier. Moreover, according to the on-chart metrics, the Optimism crypto’s RSI and MACD data are optimistic, and signal a potential price uptrend. According to the Optimism price prediction, by Q4, 2024, it can reach $5.50. Summary It’s clear that Layer-2 solutions are the future, and with that in mind Arbitrum and Optimism have major growth potential. For the time being, the most bullish performance was however experienced by KangaMoon which has surged 290% and can reach a growth of 100x following its launch. These aspects position it as the best DeFi crypto to jump into in 2024 and beyond. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) Presale Today!

    "content": "Bitcoin has again experienced a price decline since briefly climbing above the $72,000 mark on April 8. This price dip is believed to be due to a couple of factors, which no doubt present a bearish outlook for the flagship crypto. Inflation Data Expected To Come In Hot The March Consumer Price Index (CPI) data is scheduled to be released on April 10. Some market experts predict that the report will show a rise in overall inflation. This could lead to the Federal Reserve taking a hawkish stance on interest rates, negatively impacting Bitcoin’s price and the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Bullish Reversal In On-Chain Metrics, Can SHIB Price Recover? This would explain why Bitcoin’s price has declined lately, as crypto investors remain on the sidelines ahead of the CPI report. However, if the inflation figures come in favorable, this could restore investors’ confidence in the economic situation and provide a much-needed bullish outlook for the crypto market. Also, considering that January and February’s inflation data exceeded expectations, it is necessary to highlight what last month’s data exceeding expectations could mean in the long term. So far, the Fed has continued to hold interest rates steady at about 5.3%, and there was even optimism at the beginning of the year that there could be rate cuts at some point this year. However, with inflation continuing to stay well above the Central Bank’s target of 2%, there is a growing feeling that they might be forced to take drastic measures at some point. That is ultimately not good for Bitcoin’s price, especially since different crypto analysts gave bullish predictions partly based on their assumption that there would be several rate cuts this year. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Back In The Red The Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also contributed to Bitcoin’s recent decline. These investment funds experienced a net outflow on April 8 and 9, leading to a significant Bitcoin dump on the market. Specifically, these outflows came from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which recorded an outflow of $303.3 million and $154.9 million on April 8 and 9, respectively. Related Reading: VeChain On The Edge: Insider Says VET Will Reach The Finish Line Meanwhile, the other Spot Bitcoin ETFs have not recorded impressive inflows during this period, which shows their demand has slowed. For context, 6 out of the 10 Spot Bitcoin ETFs (excluding GBTC) recorded zero inflows on April 9, while 5 out of 10 recorded zero inflows on April 8. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) also recorded a relatively low inflow of $21.3 million that day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $69,300, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
