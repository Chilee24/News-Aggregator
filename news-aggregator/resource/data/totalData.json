It creates difficulty for Bitcoin wallet recovery, as highlighted in various examples. Therefore, it is important to include cryptocurrencies in estate planning or choose Dead Man�s switches for crypto.

Dormant wallets can indicate the removal of Bitcoin from active circulation, which enhances its scarcity. Bitcoin Theft Bitcoin wallets are not immune to theft.

Find out the Type of Bitcoin Wallet The first step to recovering your Bitcoin wallet is to know the type of Bitcoin wallet you want to recover.

You have to find the seed phrase on physical belongings, as it is the best chance at restoring your software wallet. If you don�t have the private keys or the seed phrase, then you can choose recovery tools to find the �wallet.dat� file. For example, Puran File Recovery is a popular tool for retrieving lost or deleted files and partitions. Recuva is also one of the popular choices for recovering deleted files from USB sticks, hard drives, and memory cards. Mac users can opt for TestDisk to recover lost partitions. However, these tools do not offer the assurance of recovering all your files and partitions. Restore Your Bitcoin Hardware Wallet You can restore Bitcoin wallet in the case of hardware wallets with the help of your PIN code. However, you would have only three attempts to enter the PIN code. Wrong attempts can cause the device to restart, and you can bid goodbye to your wallet forever. Therefore, use the PIN code method only if you remember it. Without the PIN code, you can use the seed phrase of the wallet. Most of the hardware wallet devices offer a card to write down your seed phrase. You should try looking for that card or any copies that you might have made. Look for it everywhere before you are sure that you have lost it. The last resort to recover your Bitcoin hardware wallet involves physically hacking into the wallet.

    "content": "Cryptocurrency exchanges are the biggest tools used in the crypto industry at the moment. The first crypto exchange was created in 2010, and then many others made their entry into the market, improving the accessibility of cryptocurrencies. However, centralized exchanges have posed significant limitations that restrict the potential for large-scale usage. Therefore, the best decentralized exchanges have emerged as helpful alternatives for crypto traders. The examples of centralized crypto exchanges such as FTX set the wrong precedent for crypto users. On top of it, the frequent complaints about downtime on popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase also showcase the crypto industry in bad light. Let us find out how decentralized exchanges solve the problems found in centralized exchanges and a list of popular decentralized exchanges you should try in 2024. Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains� Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects. How Does a Decentralized Exchange Work? You can compare the different entries in a list of decentralized exchanges with an enhanced understanding of their working mechanism. Decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, are peer-to-peer marketplaces that remove the single points of failure evident in centralization. As a result, they help take away most of the risks associated with centralized exchanges. Aren�t they meant to be the perfect solutions to problems with centralized exchanges? Do DEXs address only the risk of single points of failure? The first generation of DEXs aimed at replicating the user experience of centralized exchanges and used order books. However, such types of decentralized exchanges presented difficulties in usability and were expensive and inefficient. The reputation of decentralized exchanges improved when Automated Market Makers or AMMs were introduced in DEX design. Most of the top decentralized exchanges use AMMs, which are smart contracts that can automatically set the price of crypto assets on the basis of supply and demand. The new decentralized exchanges could allow anyone to swap tokens in a trustless environment and lock their tokens in liquidity pools. AMM smart contracts are responsible for establishing the exchange rate and the rewards for liquidity providers. At the same time, AMMs also offer an intuitive user experience in decentralized exchanges. 1Inch The first entry among the most notable DEXs is 1Inch, which offers the advantage of combining the best features of different DEXs. 1Inch helps you avoid confusion with queries like �Which is the best-decentralized exchange?� as it is a DEX aggregator. It works by finding the best prices by comparing liquidity across different decentralized exchanges. Crypto investors can rely on 1Inch for freedom from transaction or withdrawal fees. On top of it, 1Inch offers support for different crypto wallets, thereby ensuring better accessibility to the crypto space.

On top of that, Uniswap is the first decentralized exchange in the world to offer flexibility for trading ERC20 tokens. Uniswap also has its native token, UNI, which allows the owners to provide liquidity to the exchange and earn rewards. However, it has some limitations, such as offering support only for EVM-compatible crypto tokens. PancakeSwap PancakeSwap, as the name implies, has some similarities to Uniswap and other AMM-based decentralized exchanges. It is the most innovative solution on Binance Smart Chain, which contributes to lower gas fees for users. PancakeSwap is a worthy contender in this list of decentralized exchanges for its emphasis on user experience. Users can also stake the native tokens on PancakeSwap to earn rewards alongside capitalizing on the flexibility for yield farming. Most important of all, it offers faster transactions than Uniswap and a bevy of user-friendly features, making it a top DEX.

Balancer also caters to the needs of traders seeking advanced strategies to offer liquidity. The diverse asset exposure opens up the prospects for landing compounded returns. SushiSwap Another prominent derivative of Uniswap, which has garnered popularity for its distinctive set of features, is SushiSwap. The primary objective of creating SushiSwap was to offer a better alternative to Uniswap with better rewards. However, it has developed its own unique identity with diverse features for users and a special theme for branding its user experience. SushiSwap users can swap assets and offer liquidity alongside borrowing and lending assets. It also follows the lines of decentralized exchanges that offer the privilege of participating in the governance of the protocol.

As you can notice, there are multiple decentralized exchanges in the market with innovative features. Therefore, it is important to differentiate between the best-decentralized exchanges to find the ideal choice for your requirements. Interestingly, a few factors can help you choose the best DEX according to your needs. First of all, you must check the blockchains on which the decentralized exchange operates, as it would dictate the level of interoperability. Another important criterion for evaluating a decentralized exchange is liquidity. Without sufficient liquidity, traders might have to face the negative consequences of slippage.

Everyone who wants to begin trading in cryptocurrencies is likely to choose third-party wallets or crypto wallets. The growing popularity of cryptocurrencies has attracted cybercriminals� attention. The evolution of cryptocurrency sector and introduction of new security measures cannot adapt to the tactics of scammers, fraudsters, and hackers. Therefore, crypto wallet security has emerged as a top priority for crypto users. It is important to reflect on the threat of security risks for crypto wallets and how to ensure effective safeguards against the risks. Let us learn more about the best practices to protect your crypto wallets from prominent security threats. Fundamentals of Crypto Wallets The best way to understand the implications of security for crypto wallets involves learning about the fundamentals of crypto wallets. It can help you understand the potential risks for security of cryptocurrency wallets with knowledge of their working mechanisms. Crypto wallets are digital tools for storing, sending, and receiving cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. The working mechanism of crypto wallets revolves around the use of a public key and private key. Public key is the public address of the cryptocurrency wallet. It is an alphanumeric string that helps in receiving digital currency in the crypto wallet. The public key does not include any sensitive information and is visible to everyone on the blockchain. No one can use the public key of your wallet to compromise its security. The important component responsible for cryptocurrency security issues is the private key. You can think of it as the password to your crypto wallet. The private key is an automatically generated and lengthy string of characters. You must always maintain privacy of your private key, as anyone can access your wallet and the assets in it with the private key.

    "content": "Cryptocurrency exchanges are the biggest tools used in the crypto industry at the moment. The first crypto exchange was created in 2010, and then many others made their entry into the market, improving the accessibility of cryptocurrencies. However, centralized exchanges have posed significant limitations that restrict the potential for large-scale usage. Therefore, the best decentralized exchanges have emerged as helpful alternatives for crypto traders. The examples of centralized crypto exchanges such as FTX set the wrong precedent for crypto users. On top of it, the frequent complaints about downtime on popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase also showcase the crypto industry in bad light. Let us find out how decentralized exchanges solve the problems found in centralized exchanges and a list of popular decentralized exchanges you should try in 2024. Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains� Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects. How Does a Decentralized Exchange Work? You can compare the different entries in a list of decentralized exchanges with an enhanced understanding of their working mechanism. Decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, are peer-to-peer marketplaces that remove the single points of failure evident in centralization. As a result, they help take away most of the risks associated with centralized exchanges. Aren�t they meant to be the perfect solutions to problems with centralized exchanges? Do DEXs address only the risk of single points of failure? The first generation of DEXs aimed at replicating the user experience of centralized exchanges and used order books. However, such types of decentralized exchanges presented difficulties in usability and were expensive and inefficient. The reputation of decentralized exchanges improved when Automated Market Makers or AMMs were introduced in DEX design. Most of the top decentralized exchanges use AMMs, which are smart contracts that can automatically set the price of crypto assets on the basis of supply and demand. The new decentralized exchanges could allow anyone to swap tokens in a trustless environment and lock their tokens in liquidity pools. AMM smart contracts are responsible for establishing the exchange rate and the rewards for liquidity providers. At the same time, AMMs also offer an intuitive user experience in decentralized exchanges. 1Inch The first entry among the most notable DEXs is 1Inch, which offers the advantage of combining the best features of different DEXs. 1Inch helps you avoid confusion with queries like �Which is the best-decentralized exchange?� as it is a DEX aggregator. It works by finding the best prices by comparing liquidity across different decentralized exchanges. Crypto investors can rely on 1Inch for freedom from transaction or withdrawal fees. On top of it, 1Inch offers support for different crypto wallets, thereby ensuring better accessibility to the crypto space. Want to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies? Enroll now in the Crypto Fundamentals, Trading And Investing Course dYdX Order-based DEXs did not match up to the challenge of achieving better solutions to issues of centralized exchanges. However, dYdX still enjoys popularity amidst AMM-based DEXs. It offers many features like shirt selling, leveraged trading, and lending. Therefore, it is a better alternative than simple AMMs. dYdX is a promising addition to the most popular decentralized exchanges, and it combines multiple features in one package. It offers a user-friendly interface, deep liquidity, and advantages of low fees. Uniswap Uniswap is the leading decentralized exchange in the market, with a wide user base. It offers liquidity for the most popular crypto tokens and leverages AMMs for self-regulation. The DAO governance makes Uniswap one of the best-decentralized exchanges with better efficiency and transparency. On top of that, Uniswap is the first decentralized exchange in the world to offer flexibility for trading ERC20 tokens. Uniswap also has its native token, UNI, which allows the owners to provide liquidity to the exchange and earn rewards. However, it has some limitations, such as offering support only for EVM-compatible crypto tokens. PancakeSwap PancakeSwap, as the name implies, has some similarities to Uniswap and other AMM-based decentralized exchanges. It is the most innovative solution on Binance Smart Chain, which contributes to lower gas fees for users. PancakeSwap is a worthy contender in this list of decentralized exchanges for its emphasis on user experience. Users can also stake the native tokens on PancakeSwap to earn rewards alongside capitalizing on the flexibility for yield farming. Most important of all, it offers faster transactions than Uniswap and a bevy of user-friendly features, making it a top DEX. Curve Finance The next top name among the biggest decentralized exchanges is Curve Finance. As a matter of fact, Curve Finance is the second biggest decentralized exchange on Ethereum in terms of TVL. Initially, it offered the facility for stablecoin swaps only. However, it has evolved and offers many trading pairs now. On the other hand, the optimization of Curve Finance for stablecoin trading makes it the best pick for low-slippage rates. Another impressive feature of Curve Finance is the support for multiple blockchains alongside better efficiency for larger transactions. Balancer Balancer is another popular choice among decentralized exchanges for its unique features. It is a prominent answer to questions such as �Which is the best-decentralized exchange?� because of its capability to help users manage a diverse portfolio. The DEX offers the flexibility for creating and joining pools with a combination of eight different crypto tokens. Balancer is the ideal decentralized exchange for anyone who wants to manage a diverse portfolio of crypto assets. Balancer also caters to the needs of traders seeking advanced strategies to offer liquidity. The diverse asset exposure opens up the prospects for landing compounded returns. SushiSwap Another prominent derivative of Uniswap, which has garnered popularity for its distinctive set of features, is SushiSwap. The primary objective of creating SushiSwap was to offer a better alternative to Uniswap with better rewards. However, it has developed its own unique identity with diverse features for users and a special theme for branding its user experience. SushiSwap users can swap assets and offer liquidity alongside borrowing and lending assets. It also follows the lines of decentralized exchanges that offer the privilege of participating in the governance of the protocol. Orca The goals of Orca also focus on overcoming the pitfalls of centralized crypto exchanges, such as ensuring faster and more secure transactions. It is one of the most popular decentralized exchanges with the flexibility for trading cryptocurrencies on Solana blockchain. The most prominent feature of Orca is the innovative UI that helps users change their language settings directly from the DEX and view token balances. On top of that, Orca has proved to be the best pick for traders who prefer anonymity. Users can also capitalize on the advantage of trading directly from wallets and reducing the risk of losing funds to hacking or third-party mismanagement. Enroll now in the Solana Development Course to understand the workings of the Anchor framework, Solana Program Library, and Solana tokens. Vertex The most interesting origin story among decentralized exchanges probably belongs to Vertex. It is the perfect example of how the best-decentralized exchanges can brave any odds. Vertex was created on the Terra blockchain, which suffered a massive breakdown. However, the decentralized exchange did not stop there, and all its operations were transitioned to the Arbitrum blockchain. Vertex went through major changes in its overall structure and goals. One of the most interesting features of Vertex is the option for bridging to 8 different blockchains, which ensures interoperability. In addition, it also offers faster order-matching mechanisms that can improve efficiency of crypto transactions. Apex Protocol The collection of the best DEXs would be incomplete without adding the Apex protocol. It has gained popularity for offering an elastic AMM. Apex protocol is also one of the top decentralized exchanges, with the facility for order book trading. Beginners can also leverage the flexibility for spot trading on the platform. Another unique highlight of the Apex protocol is the Starkware layer 2 scalability mechanism that also addresses security concerns. As a matter of fact, Apex protocol has gained popularity for offering improved privacy and security features. How Can You Choose the Right DEXs? As you can notice, there are multiple decentralized exchanges in the market with innovative features. Therefore, it is important to differentiate between the best-decentralized exchanges to find the ideal choice for your requirements. Interestingly, a few factors can help you choose the best DEX according to your needs. First of all, you must check the blockchains on which the decentralized exchange operates, as it would dictate the level of interoperability. Another important criterion for evaluating a decentralized exchange is liquidity. Without sufficient liquidity, traders might have to face the negative consequences of slippage. You must also evaluate a decentralized exchange on the basis of whether it is open or permissioned. For example, certain DEXs only allow the community members to add new liquidity pools. Most importantly, you can compare the best DEXs on the basis of their security features.

    "content": "The cryptocurrency industry is evolving at an impressive pace with the integration of new utilities in cryptocurrencies. Everyone who wants to begin trading in cryptocurrencies is likely to choose third-party wallets or crypto wallets. The growing popularity of cryptocurrencies has attracted cybercriminals� attention. The evolution of cryptocurrency sector and introduction of new security measures cannot adapt to the tactics of scammers, fraudsters, and hackers. Therefore, crypto wallet security has emerged as a top priority for crypto users. It is important to reflect on the threat of security risks for crypto wallets and how to ensure effective safeguards against the risks. Let us learn more about the best practices to protect your crypto wallets from prominent security threats. Fundamentals of Crypto Wallets The best way to understand the implications of security for crypto wallets involves learning about the fundamentals of crypto wallets. It can help you understand the potential risks for security of cryptocurrency wallets with knowledge of their working mechanisms. Crypto wallets are digital tools for storing, sending, and receiving cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. The working mechanism of crypto wallets revolves around the use of a public key and private key. Public key is the public address of the cryptocurrency wallet. It is an alphanumeric string that helps in receiving digital currency in the crypto wallet. The public key does not include any sensitive information and is visible to everyone on the blockchain. No one can use the public key of your wallet to compromise its security. The important component responsible for cryptocurrency security issues is the private key. You can think of it as the password to your crypto wallet. The private key is an automatically generated and lengthy string of characters. You must always maintain privacy of your private key, as anyone can access your wallet and the assets in it with the private key. Excited to learn the basics of cryptocurrency and the ways in which blockchain technology empowers cryptocurrencies, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course How Many Types of Crypto Wallets Can You Use? The concerns regarding security of crypto wallets round-up on the selection of an ideal crypto wallet. You can find answers to �How secure is a crypto wallet?� by checking the type of the wallet. Some of the most popular crypto wallet variants include hardware wallets, software wallets, paper wallets, and web wallets. Hardware Wallets Hardware wallets are USB-shaped devices that offer storage of private keys in an offline environment. Therefore, they are the most trusted picks for secure crypto storage. Hardware wallets are the best choice to avoid messages like �crypto wallet hacked� as they are immune to malware. However, hardware wallets have setbacks, such as complex setup processes and limited accessibility. Software Wallets Software wallets are programs that you can use on mobile devices or computers to store and trade cryptocurrencies. While software wallets guarantee convenient and quick transactions, they are vulnerable to malware and hacking attacks. Paper Wallets Paper wallets are physical documents on which you can write your private and public keys. You can trust paper wallets for security against hacking and malware, as you can store paper wallets in secure locations. On the other hand, crypto wallet security for paper wallets is restricted to physical vulnerabilities and a lack of recovery mechanisms. On top of it, retrieving and using your cryptocurrencies can be a challenging task with paper wallets. Web Wallets Web wallets or hosted wallets are offered by online platforms and third-party websites. Such types of wallets offer better convenience for faster access to cryptocurrencies and completion of transactions. However, they are limited in terms of security due to the storage of private keys on remote servers. Start learning about cryptocurrencies with world�s first Cryptocurrency Skill Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts! Why Should You Focus on Crypto Wallet Security? The rising number of cryptocurrency thefts, hacking attacks, and scams has created the need to emphasize wallet security. The emphasis on concerns such as �How secure is a crypto wallet?� can be attributed to the increasing frequency of innovative efforts by criminals to exploit security vulnerabilities. Frequent security attacks can have a significant financial impact on the crypto landscape, which is still in its initial stages. On top of it, security breaches in crypto wallets can also affect the trust of investors and companies in cryptocurrencies. Hackers are working together, especially with the rise of collaborative groups that have criminals with different skill sets. They come up with innovative and sophisticated attack strategies in response to the evolving security measures for crypto wallets. The Federal Trade Commission has reported that cryptocurrency fraud and scams have increased by over 300% every year since 2016. Therefore, it is important to understand the different threats to security of crypto wallets. What are the Most Common Security Risks for Crypto Wallets? The best practices recommended for strengthening the security of cryptocurrency wallets emphasize the need to identify common security risks. Here is an outline of the most popular threats to security of crypto wallets. Malware Attacks The most common type of attacks on crypto wallets are malware attacks. Such types of attacks involve infecting your device with malware or malicious software, such as ransomware, keyloggers, or Trojans. The malware steals information from your device and can access your private keys without your consent. You can prevent such threats through regular updates of your devices and effective antivirus software. Phishing Attacks Phishing attack is still one of the prominent cryptocurrency security issues as it is effective and widely used by scammers. Malicious agents try to impersonate legitimate entities and websites to trick users and gain access to sensitive information. Therefore, it is important to verify every unsolicited mail, message, or link and avoid sharing sensitive information. Wallet Security Breaches The different types of crypto wallets offer unique advantages, albeit with some critical security considerations. Hardware wallets are safe from malware attacks but vulnerable to physical damage. On the other hand, software wallets and mobile wallets are vulnerable to security issues as they are exposed to online environments. You must choose a reliable crypto wallet after comprehensive research to ensure that it meets your security needs. Exchange Attacks The overview of security risks for crypto wallets also invites attention to vulnerabilities in crypto exchanges. You can find your crypto wallet hacked when crypto exchanges are under attack. Security breaches in crypto exchanges have led to loss of customer funds. You should do your research and choose reputed exchanges that feature strong security measures. Want to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies? Enroll now in the Crypto Fundamentals, Trading And Investing Course How Can You Secure Your Cryptocurrencies? You can take care of the security of your crypto wallets by following certain best practices. Here are the important recommendations by experts to protect your crypto wallets from security breaches. Go for a Cold Wallet The most common suggestion for crypto wallet security focuses on using cold wallets or hardware wallets. The hardware wallets are encrypted and connected to the internet, albeit with a limited security risk. You can go for the USB-shaped hardware wallets or use paper wallets to avoid the risks of malware attacks, phishing attacks, and crypto exchange attacks. Use Two-Factor Authentication Hardware wallets or physical wallets can provide better security. However, they lack the ease of use that you get with software wallets. In the case of software wallets, you can use two-factor authentication to introduce an additional layer of security for the wallet. The two-factor authentication method involves the receipt of a one-time code on smartphones. It combines two different levels of access, thereby creating difficulty for hackers. Rely on Unique and Strong Passwords Another common suggestion that you must follow to protect your crypto wallets is the use of strong and unique passwords. You can find the perfect answer to �How to secure your crypto wallets� by using a robust password. It is important to create a password with special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers. The best practices for setting passwords for crypto wallets also advise against using names and birthdays. Regular Wallet Backup and Updates You can find an effective approach to secure crypto wallets by regularly backing up the wallet data. The best thing you can do to secure your crypto wallet is to choose a secure location for your backup. Developers also release updates at different times to address the security vulnerabilities in crypto wallets. Therefore, you must always update your crypto wallet to avoid any unprecedented damage. Never Use Public Wi-Fi The security of your internet connection also plays a vital role in security of your crypto wallets. You can stay safe from cryptocurrency security issues by avoiding public Wi-Fi, as it could be a breeding ground for security threats. Experts suggest that you can use a VPN to protect the IP address and ensure prevention of DNS leaks.

    "content": "The cryptocurrency revolution has changed many of our conventional notions about financial transactions and the exchange of information. People search for terms like �cryptocurrency future scope� before investing anything in cryptocurrencies. Public-key cryptography emerged as a concept in 1978 and established the foundations for development of cryptocurrencies. Decades later, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin to the world in 2009. The unique traits of Bitcoin spurred the rise of many other cryptocurrencies or altcoins, such as Litecoin and Namecoin. Subsequently, Ethereum blockchain introduced smart contracts in 2015 and completely transformed the blockchain ecosystem. In addition, cryptocurrencies have also fuelled innovation around the world, with the scope for real-world utility and the growth of DeFi. Let us dive deeper into the future of crypto in the next 5 years. Embrace the technological leap and global adoption that awaits in the upcoming bull run of 2024-2025 with Crypto Bull Run Ready Career Path What are the Major Developments in the Crypto Market?

If you want to understand the future of crypto in the next 5 years, then you must understand the current developments in the crypto market. One of the notable highlights of the existing crypto market is the resilience of cryptocurrencies in the face of fluctuations. Interestingly, businesses, governments, and investors worldwide have embraced cryptocurrencies as a trusted financial instrument. On top of it, the existing crypto market features a vibrant combination of new cryptocurrencies and regulatory developments. Institutional Adoption of Cryptocurrencies Big corporations such as Microsoft, AMC, Tesla, AT\u0026T, and PayPal have adopted cryptocurrencies for their financial transactions. The trend has not been slowing down, and many new businesses will also join this trend in future. For example, corporate giant MicroStrategy has been continuously investing in Bitcoin, thereby leading to a rise in institutional investments. Rise of Decentralized Finance Another prominent addition among current trends that would influence the future of cryptocurrency is the rise of DeFi. Decentralized finance has become an important trend in the crypto landscape due to its unique value-based benefits. Most importantly, DeFi aims to transform the conventional financial landscape by offering financial services without intermediaries such as banks or brokerage firms. The growth of DeFi is clearly evident in the rising number of DeFi applications for different financial services, including insurance and lending.

Even if regulations bring certain risks to the world of cryptocurrencies, they also promise certain advantages, such as investor protection and improved stability. Most importantly, crypto regulations can open new opportunities, such as investment in crypto ETFs. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has recently introduced approval for crypto ETFs, including Bitcoin ETFs. You can notice how enhanced regulations can improve the legitimacy of the crypto market and attract more investors. On the other hand, excessive pressure from regulations can restrict innovation while reducing the element of decentralization that differentiates crypto from other financial instruments. Bitcoin Halving The list of prominent trends in the crypto market right now also draws attention towards Bitcoin halving. It represents a recurring event on Bitcoin blockchain that involves reducing the Bitcoin mining rewards by half. The last halving event of Bitcoin reduced the block reward to 6.25 BTC from 12.5 BTC in May 2020. Most of the short-term cryptocurrency future predictions include Bitcoin halving expected in 2024.

Find out the Type of Bitcoin Wallet The first step to recovering your Bitcoin wallet is to know the type of Bitcoin wallet you want to recover. You may have selected a web wallet for convenience or a hardware wallet for security. Some people also choose paper wallets for simplicity or mobile wallets to access their crypto assets from anywhere. The answers to �How do I recover my lost Bitcoin wallet?� might suggest that you should look for transaction history on Blockchain Explorer.

You have to find the seed phrase on physical belongings, as it is the best chance at restoring your software wallet. If you don�t have the private keys or the seed phrase, then you can choose recovery tools to find the �wallet.dat� file. For example, Puran File Recovery is a popular tool for retrieving lost or deleted files and partitions. Recuva is also one of the popular choices for recovering deleted files from USB sticks, hard drives, and memory cards. Mac users can opt for TestDisk to recover lost partitions. However, these tools do not offer the assurance of recovering all your files and partitions. Restore Your Bitcoin Hardware Wallet You can restore Bitcoin wallet in the case of hardware wallets with the help of your PIN code. However, you would have only three attempts to enter the PIN code. Wrong attempts can cause the device to restart, and you can bid goodbye to your wallet forever. Therefore, use the PIN code method only if you remember it. Without the PIN code, you can use the seed phrase of the wallet. Most of the hardware wallet devices offer a card to write down your seed phrase. You should try looking for that card or any copies that you might have made. Look for it everywhere before you are sure that you have lost it. The last resort to recover your Bitcoin hardware wallet involves physically hacking into the wallet.

    "content": "Cryptocurrency exchanges are the biggest tools used in the crypto industry at the moment. The first crypto exchange was created in 2010, and then many others made their entry into the market, improving the accessibility of cryptocurrencies. However, centralized exchanges have posed significant limitations that restrict the potential for large-scale usage. Therefore, the best decentralized exchanges have emerged as helpful alternatives for crypto traders. The examples of centralized crypto exchanges such as FTX set the wrong precedent for crypto users. On top of it, the frequent complaints about downtime on popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase also showcase the crypto industry in bad light. Let us find out how decentralized exchanges solve the problems found in centralized exchanges and a list of popular decentralized exchanges you should try in 2024. Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains� Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects. How Does a Decentralized Exchange Work? You can compare the different entries in a list of decentralized exchanges with an enhanced understanding of their working mechanism. Decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, are peer-to-peer marketplaces that remove the single points of failure evident in centralization. As a result, they help take away most of the risks associated with centralized exchanges. Aren�t they meant to be the perfect solutions to problems with centralized exchanges? Do DEXs address only the risk of single points of failure? The first generation of DEXs aimed at replicating the user experience of centralized exchanges and used order books. However, such types of decentralized exchanges presented difficulties in usability and were expensive and inefficient. The reputation of decentralized exchanges improved when Automated Market Makers or AMMs were introduced in DEX design. Most of the top decentralized exchanges use AMMs, which are smart contracts that can automatically set the price of crypto assets on the basis of supply and demand. The new decentralized exchanges could allow anyone to swap tokens in a trustless environment and lock their tokens in liquidity pools. AMM smart contracts are responsible for establishing the exchange rate and the rewards for liquidity providers. At the same time, AMMs also offer an intuitive user experience in decentralized exchanges. 1Inch The first entry among the most notable DEXs is 1Inch, which offers the advantage of combining the best features of different DEXs. 1Inch helps you avoid confusion with queries like �Which is the best-decentralized exchange?� as it is a DEX aggregator. It works by finding the best prices by comparing liquidity across different decentralized exchanges. Crypto investors can rely on 1Inch for freedom from transaction or withdrawal fees. On top of it, 1Inch offers support for different crypto wallets, thereby ensuring better accessibility to the crypto space. Want to get an in-depth understanding of crypto fundamentals, trading and investing strategies? Enroll now in the Crypto Fundamentals, Trading And Investing Course dYdX Order-based DEXs did not match up to the challenge of achieving better solutions to issues of centralized exchanges. However, dYdX still enjoys popularity amidst AMM-based DEXs. It offers many features like shirt selling, leveraged trading, and lending. Therefore, it is a better alternative than simple AMMs. dYdX is a promising addition to the most popular decentralized exchanges, and it combines multiple features in one package. It offers a user-friendly interface, deep liquidity, and advantages of low fees. Uniswap Uniswap is the leading decentralized exchange in the market, with a wide user base. It offers liquidity for the most popular crypto tokens and leverages AMMs for self-regulation. The DAO governance makes Uniswap one of the best-decentralized exchanges with better efficiency and transparency. On top of that, Uniswap is the first decentralized exchange in the world to offer flexibility for trading ERC20 tokens. Uniswap also has its native token, UNI, which allows the owners to provide liquidity to the exchange and earn rewards. However, it has some limitations, such as offering support only for EVM-compatible crypto tokens. PancakeSwap PancakeSwap, as the name implies, has some similarities to Uniswap and other AMM-based decentralized exchanges. It is the most innovative solution on Binance Smart Chain, which contributes to lower gas fees for users. PancakeSwap is a worthy contender in this list of decentralized exchanges for its emphasis on user experience. Users can also stake the native tokens on PancakeSwap to earn rewards alongside capitalizing on the flexibility for yield farming. Most important of all, it offers faster transactions than Uniswap and a bevy of user-friendly features, making it a top DEX. Curve Finance The next top name among the biggest decentralized exchanges is Curve Finance. As a matter of fact, Curve Finance is the second biggest decentralized exchange on Ethereum in terms of TVL. Initially, it offered the facility for stablecoin swaps only. However, it has evolved and offers many trading pairs now. On the other hand, the optimization of Curve Finance for stablecoin trading makes it the best pick for low-slippage rates. Another impressive feature of Curve Finance is the support for multiple blockchains alongside better efficiency for larger transactions. Balancer Balancer is another popular choice among decentralized exchanges for its unique features. It is a prominent answer to questions such as �Which is the best-decentralized exchange?� because of its capability to help users manage a diverse portfolio. The DEX offers the flexibility for creating and joining pools with a combination of eight different crypto tokens. Balancer is the ideal decentralized exchange for anyone who wants to manage a diverse portfolio of crypto assets. Balancer also caters to the needs of traders seeking advanced strategies to offer liquidity. The diverse asset exposure opens up the prospects for landing compounded returns. SushiSwap Another prominent derivative of Uniswap, which has garnered popularity for its distinctive set of features, is SushiSwap. The primary objective of creating SushiSwap was to offer a better alternative to Uniswap with better rewards. However, it has developed its own unique identity with diverse features for users and a special theme for branding its user experience. SushiSwap users can swap assets and offer liquidity alongside borrowing and lending assets. It also follows the lines of decentralized exchanges that offer the privilege of participating in the governance of the protocol. Orca The goals of Orca also focus on overcoming the pitfalls of centralized crypto exchanges, such as ensuring faster and more secure transactions. It is one of the most popular decentralized exchanges with the flexibility for trading cryptocurrencies on Solana blockchain. The most prominent feature of Orca is the innovative UI that helps users change their language settings directly from the DEX and view token balances. On top of that, Orca has proved to be the best pick for traders who prefer anonymity. Users can also capitalize on the advantage of trading directly from wallets and reducing the risk of losing funds to hacking or third-party mismanagement. Enroll now in the Solana Development Course to understand the workings of the Anchor framework, Solana Program Library, and Solana tokens. Vertex The most interesting origin story among decentralized exchanges probably belongs to Vertex. It is the perfect example of how the best-decentralized exchanges can brave any odds. Vertex was created on the Terra blockchain, which suffered a massive breakdown. However, the decentralized exchange did not stop there, and all its operations were transitioned to the Arbitrum blockchain. Vertex went through major changes in its overall structure and goals. One of the most interesting features of Vertex is the option for bridging to 8 different blockchains, which ensures interoperability. In addition, it also offers faster order-matching mechanisms that can improve efficiency of crypto transactions. Apex Protocol The collection of the best DEXs would be incomplete without adding the Apex protocol. It has gained popularity for offering an elastic AMM. Apex protocol is also one of the top decentralized exchanges, with the facility for order book trading. Beginners can also leverage the flexibility for spot trading on the platform. Another unique highlight of the Apex protocol is the Starkware layer 2 scalability mechanism that also addresses security concerns. As a matter of fact, Apex protocol has gained popularity for offering improved privacy and security features. How Can You Choose the Right DEXs? As you can notice, there are multiple decentralized exchanges in the market with innovative features. Therefore, it is important to differentiate between the best-decentralized exchanges to find the ideal choice for your requirements. Interestingly, a few factors can help you choose the best DEX according to your needs. First of all, you must check the blockchains on which the decentralized exchange operates, as it would dictate the level of interoperability. Another important criterion for evaluating a decentralized exchange is liquidity. Without sufficient liquidity, traders might have to face the negative consequences of slippage. You must also evaluate a decentralized exchange on the basis of whether it is open or permissioned. For example, certain DEXs only allow the community members to add new liquidity pools. Most importantly, you can compare the best DEXs on the basis of their security features.

    "content": "The cryptocurrency industry is evolving at an impressive pace with the integration of new utilities in cryptocurrencies. Everyone who wants to begin trading in cryptocurrencies is likely to choose third-party wallets or crypto wallets. The growing popularity of cryptocurrencies has attracted cybercriminals� attention. The evolution of cryptocurrency sector and introduction of new security measures cannot adapt to the tactics of scammers, fraudsters, and hackers. Therefore, crypto wallet security has emerged as a top priority for crypto users. It is important to reflect on the threat of security risks for crypto wallets and how to ensure effective safeguards against the risks. Let us learn more about the best practices to protect your crypto wallets from prominent security threats. Fundamentals of Crypto Wallets The best way to understand the implications of security for crypto wallets involves learning about the fundamentals of crypto wallets. It can help you understand the potential risks for security of cryptocurrency wallets with knowledge of their working mechanisms. Crypto wallets are digital tools for storing, sending, and receiving cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. The working mechanism of crypto wallets revolves around the use of a public key and private key. Public key is the public address of the cryptocurrency wallet. It is an alphanumeric string that helps in receiving digital currency in the crypto wallet. The public key does not include any sensitive information and is visible to everyone on the blockchain. No one can use the public key of your wallet to compromise its security. The important component responsible for cryptocurrency security issues is the private key. You can think of it as the password to your crypto wallet. The private key is an automatically generated and lengthy string of characters. You must always maintain privacy of your private key, as anyone can access your wallet and the assets in it with the private key. Excited to learn the basics of cryptocurrency and the ways in which blockchain technology empowers cryptocurrencies, Enroll now in the Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Course How Many Types of Crypto Wallets Can You Use? The concerns regarding security of crypto wallets round-up on the selection of an ideal crypto wallet. You can find answers to �How secure is a crypto wallet?� by checking the type of the wallet. Some of the most popular crypto wallet variants include hardware wallets, software wallets, paper wallets, and web wallets. Hardware Wallets Hardware wallets are USB-shaped devices that offer storage of private keys in an offline environment. Therefore, they are the most trusted picks for secure crypto storage. Hardware wallets are the best choice to avoid messages like �crypto wallet hacked� as they are immune to malware. However, hardware wallets have setbacks, such as complex setup processes and limited accessibility. Software Wallets Software wallets are programs that you can use on mobile devices or computers to store and trade cryptocurrencies. While software wallets guarantee convenient and quick transactions, they are vulnerable to malware and hacking attacks. Paper Wallets Paper wallets are physical documents on which you can write your private and public keys. You can trust paper wallets for security against hacking and malware, as you can store paper wallets in secure locations. On the other hand, crypto wallet security for paper wallets is restricted to physical vulnerabilities and a lack of recovery mechanisms. On top of it, retrieving and using your cryptocurrencies can be a challenging task with paper wallets. Web Wallets Web wallets or hosted wallets are offered by online platforms and third-party websites. Such types of wallets offer better convenience for faster access to cryptocurrencies and completion of transactions. However, they are limited in terms of security due to the storage of private keys on remote servers. Start learning about cryptocurrencies with world�s first Cryptocurrency Skill Path with quality resources tailored by industry experts! Why Should You Focus on Crypto Wallet Security? The rising number of cryptocurrency thefts, hacking attacks, and scams has created the need to emphasize wallet security. The emphasis on concerns such as �How secure is a crypto wallet?� can be attributed to the increasing frequency of innovative efforts by criminals to exploit security vulnerabilities. Frequent security attacks can have a significant financial impact on the crypto landscape, which is still in its initial stages. On top of it, security breaches in crypto wallets can also affect the trust of investors and companies in cryptocurrencies. Hackers are working together, especially with the rise of collaborative groups that have criminals with different skill sets. They come up with innovative and sophisticated attack strategies in response to the evolving security measures for crypto wallets. The Federal Trade Commission has reported that cryptocurrency fraud and scams have increased by over 300% every year since 2016. Therefore, it is important to understand the different threats to security of crypto wallets. What are the Most Common Security Risks for Crypto Wallets? The best practices recommended for strengthening the security of cryptocurrency wallets emphasize the need to identify common security risks. Here is an outline of the most popular threats to security of crypto wallets. Malware Attacks The most common type of attacks on crypto wallets are malware attacks. Such types of attacks involve infecting your device with malware or malicious software, such as ransomware, keyloggers, or Trojans. The malware steals information from your device and can access your private keys without your consent. You can prevent such threats through regular updates of your devices and effective antivirus software. Phishing Attacks Phishing attack is still one of the prominent cryptocurrency security issues as it is effective and widely used by scammers. Malicious agents try to impersonate legitimate entities and websites to trick users and gain access to sensitive information. Therefore, it is important to verify every unsolicited mail, message, or link and avoid sharing sensitive information. Wallet Security Breaches The different types of crypto wallets offer unique advantages, albeit with some critical security considerations. Hardware wallets are safe from malware attacks but vulnerable to physical damage. On the other hand, software wallets and mobile wallets are vulnerable to security issues as they are exposed to online environments. You must choose a reliable crypto wallet after comprehensive research to ensure that it meets your security needs. Exchange Attacks The overview of security risks for crypto wallets also invites attention to vulnerabilities in crypto exchanges. You can find your crypto wallet hacked when crypto exchanges are under attack. Security breaches in crypto exchanges have led to loss of customer funds.

Enroll now in the Crypto Fundamentals, Trading And Investing Course How Can You Secure Your Cryptocurrencies? You can take care of the security of your crypto wallets by following certain best practices. Here are the important recommendations by experts to protect your crypto wallets from security breaches. Go for a Cold Wallet The most common suggestion for crypto wallet security focuses on using cold wallets or hardware wallets. The hardware wallets are encrypted and connected to the internet, albeit with a limited security risk. You can go for the USB-shaped hardware wallets or use paper wallets to avoid the risks of malware attacks, phishing attacks, and crypto exchange attacks. Use Two-Factor Authentication Hardware wallets or physical wallets can provide better security. However, they lack the ease of use that you get with software wallets. In the case of software wallets, you can use two-factor authentication to introduce an additional layer of security for the wallet. The two-factor authentication method involves the receipt of a one-time code on smartphones. It combines two different levels of access, thereby creating difficulty for hackers. Rely on Unique and Strong Passwords Another common suggestion that you must follow to protect your crypto wallets is the use of strong and unique passwords. You can find the perfect answer to �How to secure your crypto wallets� by using a robust password. It is important to create a password with special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers. The best practices for setting passwords for crypto wallets also advise against using names and birthdays. Regular Wallet Backup and Updates You can find an effective approach to secure crypto wallets by regularly backing up the wallet data. The best thing you can do to secure your crypto wallet is to choose a secure location for your backup. Developers also release updates at different times to address the security vulnerabilities in crypto wallets. Therefore, you must always update your crypto wallet to avoid any unprecedented damage. Never Use Public Wi-Fi The security of your internet connection also plays a vital role in security of your crypto wallets. You can stay safe from cryptocurrency security issues by avoiding public Wi-Fi, as it could be a breeding ground for security threats. Experts suggest that you can use a VPN to protect the IP address and ensure prevention of DNS leaks.

    "content": "The cryptocurrency revolution has changed many of our conventional notions about financial transactions and the exchange of information. People search for terms like �cryptocurrency future scope� before investing anything in cryptocurrencies. Public-key cryptography emerged as a concept in 1978 and established the foundations for development of cryptocurrencies. Decades later, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin to the world in 2009. The unique traits of Bitcoin spurred the rise of many other cryptocurrencies or altcoins, such as Litecoin and Namecoin. Subsequently, Ethereum blockchain introduced smart contracts in 2015 and completely transformed the blockchain ecosystem. In addition, cryptocurrencies have also fuelled innovation around the world, with the scope for real-world utility and the growth of DeFi. Let us dive deeper into the future of crypto in the next 5 years. Embrace the technological leap and global adoption that awaits in the upcoming bull run of 2024-2025 with Crypto Bull Run Ready Career Path What are the Major Developments in the Crypto Market? The journey of the crypto market has been a phenomenal one till now. You must have noticed how the value of the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, increased by huge margins in 2021 and fell down suddenly before recovering with time. If you want to understand the future of crypto in the next 5 years, then you must understand the current developments in the crypto market. One of the notable highlights of the existing crypto market is the resilience of cryptocurrencies in the face of fluctuations. Interestingly, businesses, governments, and investors worldwide have embraced cryptocurrencies as a trusted financial instrument. On top of it, the existing crypto market features a vibrant combination of new cryptocurrencies and regulatory developments. Institutional Adoption of Cryptocurrencies Big corporations such as Microsoft, AMC, Tesla, AT\u0026T, and PayPal have adopted cryptocurrencies for their financial transactions. The trend has not been slowing down, and many new businesses will also join this trend in future. For example, corporate giant MicroStrategy has been continuously investing in Bitcoin, thereby leading to a rise in institutional investments. Rise of Decentralized Finance Another prominent addition among current trends that would influence the future of cryptocurrency is the rise of DeFi. Decentralized finance has become an important trend in the crypto landscape due to its unique value-based benefits. Most importantly, DeFi aims to transform the conventional financial landscape by offering financial services without intermediaries such as banks or brokerage firms. The growth of DeFi is clearly evident in the rising number of DeFi applications for different financial services, including insurance and lending. On top of it, you must also note how the DeFi sector has grown at an exponential rate in recent times. Some of the most popular DeFi protocols, such as MakerDAO, Uniswap, Aave, Curve Finance, and Lido, have strengthened the foundations of the DeFi market.

As a matter of fact, regulatory intervention has a major impact on long-term cryptocurrency predictions as governments are focusing more on cryptocurrencies than ever. Even if regulations bring certain risks to the world of cryptocurrencies, they also promise certain advantages, such as investor protection and improved stability. Most importantly, crypto regulations can open new opportunities, such as investment in crypto ETFs. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has recently introduced approval for crypto ETFs, including Bitcoin ETFs. You can notice how enhanced regulations can improve the legitimacy of the crypto market and attract more investors. On the other hand, excessive pressure from regulations can restrict innovation while reducing the element of decentralization that differentiates crypto from other financial instruments. Bitcoin Halving The list of prominent trends in the crypto market right now also draws attention towards Bitcoin halving. It represents a recurring event on Bitcoin blockchain that involves reducing the Bitcoin mining rewards by half. The last halving event of Bitcoin reduced the block reward to 6.25 BTC from 12.5 BTC in May 2020. Most of the short-term cryptocurrency future predictions include Bitcoin halving expected in 2024. Interestingly, the Bitcoin halving process has always led to promising price improvements due to reduction of Bitcoin supply. Therefore, the crypto market would face the impact of anticipation that can determine crypto prices in future.

With the rising adoption of machine learning in finance, it is important to check how you can use ML to improve financial services. Some of the popular financial institutions, including banks such as JP Morgan and investment funds, have embraced AI in their business operations. As a matter of fact, around 70% of all financial services institutions use machine learning in some form. Machine learning can serve the domain of finance with different applications that can help with optimization of processes in different departments and types of businesses. Let us take a look at some of the most popular use cases of machine learning for financial services. How Can You Use Machine Learning in Finance? Machine learning is a broad subdomain in computer science that helps computers learn from data without the need for special programming. It has emerged as a significant tool for improving processes and systems in different sectors, such as healthcare, retail, and manufacturing. The search for answers to queries like �How is machine learning used for finance?� draws attention to capabilities of machine learning to serve different areas, including social media communications and marketing. Therefore, it is easy to imagine how machine learning can transform the world of finance. For example, machine learning can empower automation in finance with models for credit risk predictions. Banks can use credit risk prediction models to determine the possible risks of certain lending decisions. Machine learning can also serve as a useful tool for improving finance by recommending suitable financial products at the right time. The use of machine learning in finance can help banks determine which customers they must approach for their new services. As a result, banks can ensure better management of their service portfolio alongside reducing costs through automation of repetitive processes. Machine learning models also help improve asset management and trading decisions by analyzing big data sources. Take your first step towards learning about artificial intelligence through AI Flashcards Notable Facts about the Use of ML in Finance Before you discuss the real-life use cases of machine learning for finance, it is important to learn some facts about ML in finance. Statistics about machine learning in finance industry can help in understanding how machine learning has matured into a trusted tool for transforming financial services. Research by the World Economic Forum and Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance has revealed that around 56% of financial services companies have embraced machine learning for risk management. The banking sector has gradually increased the adoption of machine learning technology. Around 75% of executives at banks with more than $100 billion in their assets have reported that they are working on adoption of AI and ML technologies. On top of that, 48% of US bank executives believe that generative AI can help in empowering customer-facing virtual assistants and chatbots. Therefore, it is important to discuss the opportunities for machine learning in the financial services industry. Machine learning can serve as a powerful resource for making sense of large collections of data by discovering important patterns. The insights from machine learning systems can help enhance business processes, serve prediction tasks, and make informed decisions. Let us take a look at some of the top applications of machine learning in the domain of financial services. Financial Monitoring The most important machine learning use case in finance is financial monitoring. Machine learning can help in enhancing tools such as investor dashboards and budgeting apps that are the best picks for monitoring financial health. In the domain of finance, financial monitoring is also referred to as personal capital management. Financial monitoring tools help financial advisors track their expenses and guide people toward their financial goals. The accuracy of machine learning can improve financial monitoring tools and notify users about discrepancies in their budget planning. Such tools can help create recommendations to ensure adjustments to individuals� financial planning methods. Identify new ways to leverage the full potential of generative AI in business use cases and become an expert in generative AI technologies with Generative AI Skill Path Automation of Financial Services Different companies leverage automation with machine learning for cost reduction. Financial institutions such as banks can have an application program interface that can generate new account applications. With machine learning in finance, the API team can automate their workflow. As a result, they could focus more on tasks such as interacting with customers and providing advice. Automation also helps reduce paperwork, which is a major goal for different financial firms. According to Reuters, banks would spend billions of dollars every year on compliance activities and paperwork. Financial advisors can also use machine learning to avoid mistakes in manual data entry tasks. Data Management The applications of ML in finance also involve data management. Data management is a crucial requirement in the financial services sector as it helps collect, store, and segment data for better analysis. The use of machine learning in finance can help in enhancing data management to ensure effective monitoring of volatility in financial markets. For example, ML systems can monitor data about all transactions by a firm to recognize patterns or trends that may indicate malicious activities. Trading Assistance Trading strategies used commonly by firms have a major effect on efficiency and costs. The applications of machine learning systems can offer new prospects for creating trading strategies based on algorithms. You can find examples of �How is machine learning used in finance?� in the algorithmic trading tools. The algorithms can automatically purchase and sell on your behalf according to market conditions. As a result, trading firms can prevent placing trades that cannot offer the desired profits. Algorithmic trading strategies have emerged as a popular alternative to ensure efficient management of risk alongside generating more returns. Loan Approval Financial institutions have to deal with a lot of paperwork in the process of loan approval. The manual process involves a review of loan applications to make decisions for approval. It can be a costly and time-consuming process. However, loan approvals provide the scope for a popular machine learning use case in finance with new ML systems. The new systems can ensure automatic review of loan applications. On top of it, machine learning can also make recommendations rather than just provide approval or deny loan applications. It helps save time and ensures approval of loans for people who would pay back the loans. As a result, ML algorithms can help in lowering the risks for lenders. Fraud Detection Machine learning systems can also help financial service firms detect fraud. The traditional methods involved rule-based systems that used predefined criteria to point out malicious transactions. However, the uses of machine learning in finance industry have been evolving. As a result, ML systems can offer faster data analysis with better accuracy. On top of it, machine learning systems can also identify anomalies and patterns that indicate potentially malicious activities. For instance, Amazon Fraud Detector by AWS uses ML algorithms to comprehensively analyze transaction data and predict the possibility of fraud risk in real-time. Therefore, machine learning can help financial institutions reduce operational, reputational, and financial risks. Regulatory Compliance Compliance is an integral aspect of the financial services sector. However, it is difficult for financial institutions to stay updated with new changes in regulations across different countries and jurisdictions within a country. Failure to comply with regulations can lead to penalties and loss of reputation. On the other hand, machine learning algorithms can help identify potential violations in regulatory compliance. ML systems can also create reports for regulatory agencies to prove that financial institutions follow all the required regulations. Churn Prediction Another prominent case of ML being used in finance is churn prediction. It helps in checking out which customers would leave a financial services firm or platform. Such applications of machine learning in finance involve churn tracking, which helps identify potential areas for improvement. For example, financial services firms can offer better training to their advisors and improve their customer experiences. On top of it, churn prediction also helps develop a better understanding of customers and figure out potential ways to prevent churn. With the right ML tools, advisors can also identify the clients who are likely to leave and offer useful advice to them. Understand the actual potential of AI and the best practices for using AI tools with the AI For Business Course. Final Words The use of machine learning in diverse areas of the financial services sector provides new opportunities for transforming finance. Machine learning is a powerful innovation that can elevate the world of finance to the next level. However, the use of machine learning in finance must follow certain best practices and standards to achieve the best results. Some of the prominent uses of machine learning systems in finance include risk management, data management, and algorithmic trading and churn prediction. With the right training approaches, you can find new ways to transform the world of finance with machine learning. Find more information about the other use cases of ML algorithms in finance and discover how machine learning can serve as a transformative force for finance.\n\n",

    "content": "The Hong Kong affiliate of cryptocurrency exchange HTX, formerly Huobi Global, has for the second time withdrawn its application for a licence to operate a virtual asset trading platform (VATP) in the city, forcing it to close operations as required by the city�s regulations.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has removed HBGL Hong Kong Limited from a list of cryptocurrency exchange licence applicants on Tuesday after the firm withdrew the application for its platform Huobi HK, according to the SFC website.\n\nHBGL first submitted its application on February 20 before withdrawing on February 23. The company then resubmitted an application on February 26, only a few days before Hong Kong�s February 29 deadline for crypto exchanges hoping to operate legally in the city.\n\nHuobi HK has not publicly disclosed the reason for its latest withdrawal, or whether it was instructed by the SFC to do so. In either case, HBGL must cease operating its exchange in the city within three months.\n\nUnder Hong Kong�s new virtual asset regime, the SFC may send a notice to a firm if it does not qualify for a so-called deeming arrangement, in which the platform is deemed to be licensed from June 1 while it awaits full approval for a licence. Businesses that fail to qualify are required to shut down by May 31 or within three months of being notified by the SFC, whichever is later.\n\nHBGL did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nHTX, founded in Beijing in 2013, is the world�s sixth-largest crypto exchange by 24-hour trading volume, according to data from market tracker CoinGecko.\n\nHTX first announced its plans to pursue a licence in Hong Kong in February last year through a statement its adviser Justin Sun posted on Twitter, now X.\n\nThe company has since declared publicly that HBGL, which was pursuing the licence for Huobi HK, is �independently managed and operated� and is not involved in HTX�s management and operation.\n\nHTX is the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange started in mainland China to be thwarted in its bid to obtain a Hong Kong licence under a new scheme that has proven to be costly and have onerous compliance requirements.\n\nHKVAEX, which the Post reported last year is a local firm backed by the world�s largest crypto exchange Binance, also withdrew its Hong Kong licence application last month. It announced that it was shutting down just three months after submitting its application.\n\nThere are now 20 applicants for Hong Kong�s VATP licence, with OKX, Crypto.com, Bybit and Bullish among the largest.\n\n",

    "content": "Police in China�s northeastern Jilin province have arrested six people in connection with a money-laundering case involving the movement of 2.14 billion yuan (US$296 million) in cryptocurrency to South Korea.\n\nJin and Shen, the surnames of two suspects, allegedly carried out an illegal currency exchange business, according to a statement issued by police in the city of Panshi, the state-run China News Service reported on Friday.\n\nSome people were defrauded out of their money, according to police, who did not identify which cryptocurrencies were used in the scheme.\n\nLaw enforcement became aware of the scheme when bank accounts under the suspects� names showed �large [daily] transactions� involving a �large number of customers�. The activity had the characteristics of an illegal underground bank, according to police.\n\nPolice said the criminal group used mainland China bank accounts to receive funds, which were then used to buy cryptocurrency at over-the-counter exchanges. The crypto could then be used to facilitate foreign money exchange for cross-border business, such as e-commerce firms and other import and export businesses.\n\nMainland China maintains a strict ban on commercial cryptocurrency activity, as Beijing has long regarded it as a threat to financial stability. The central government also has strict foreign exchange controls over capital flight concerns.\n\nIn 2021, the People�s Bank of China warned that crypto firms facilitating trading activity in China were breaking the law. The government also initiated a sweeping campaign that year to push bitcoin mining out of the country.\n\nMany companies in the industry have since moved much of their remaining operations out of mainland China. Exchanges also ostensibly stopped serving mainland users, although some like Binance have maintained easy workarounds that are widely shared online.\n\nWith the crypto trade among private individuals remaining a legal grey area, mainland China saw US$86.4 billion worth of cryptocurrency transactions from July 2022 to June 2023 � most of which took place through over-the-counter channels or grey market, peer-to-peer services, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.\n\nIn recent years, Beijing has increased its efforts in combating cryptocurrency-related money laundering. Last December, China�s prosecutors and forex regulators released a statement pledging to crack down on the use of cryptocurrencies for illegal foreign exchange trading, with a particular focus on cases involving Tether.\n\nThe government is also seeking to revise its Anti-Money-Laundering Law to address risks associated with virtual assets.\n\nThe revised draft was under review in late April by the Standing Committee of the National People�s Congress, China�s top legislative body when the full congress is not in session.\n\nIn 2022, police in the northern Inner Mongolia autonomous region arrested 63 individuals in connection with the laundering of 12 billion yuan through the use of cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, the overall volume of money in crypto-related money laundering cases has recently decreased. Illicit addresses sent US$22.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2023, a 29 per cent decline from the US$31.5 billion sent in 2022, according to Chainalysis. �Both legitimate and illicit� trading activity saw an �overall decrease� in that period, the firm said.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "�Art became an auto-generated aesthetic that pushed the artist out of the project,� notes the Lumiere Project�s Patrice Poujol, whose film company�s NFTs emphasise �real access and real experiences�\n\n",
    "content": "The non-fungible token (NFT) mania of 2021 was a phenomenon to behold. Dozens, if not hundreds, of celebrities were either pedalling NFT projects or creating their own. Savvy investors were making hundreds of millions of dollars, and it seemed like art � particularly digital art � was more lucrative than ever.\n\nMore importantly, the blockchain technology that allowed buyers to irrefutably own said artworks was set to revolutionise the art business. Artists could now sell their work directly in open marketplaces, and investors could buy and sell pieces instantly, without the need to travel to art galleries, work through an intermediary or find storage space for their collections.\n\n\n\nBuying, selling and investing in art was suddenly easier and more accessible than it had ever been.\n\nThis phenomenon was supposed to thrive regardless of how well the cryptocurrency market was doing. After all, theoretically, if the price of the cryptocurrency used to buy an NFT dropped, it would mean you�d be buying the art at a discount.\n\nInstead, what we saw during the crypto crash of 2022 was that NFTs were hit even harder. Top NFT projects like �Bored Ape Yacht Club�, which during its peak had every piece selling for tens of thousands of US dollars, saw valuations drop by over 90 per cent. The crash led to speculation that NFT mania was never about the art at all, despite what a lot of Web3 enthusiasts wanted to believe. It was about the hype. So where did it all go wrong?\n\n�Arthur Hayes [co-founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitMex] wrote an article stating that during the crypto bubble, people didn�t make money on the implementation of projects: they made their big 100-times returns based on speculation,� said Dr Patrice Poujol, who launched a Web3 film company, the Lumiere Project, in 2019. �NFTs didn�t quite work because investors didn�t perceive the value that producers thought was there, and prices came crashing back down to Earth.�\n\n\n\nPoujol, who received the first-ever PhD in Hong Kong on Web3 and creative industries at City University of Hong Kong, is a big believer in Web3 technology and the potential of NFTs to create more vibrant ecosystems in all forms of art � from film and music, to digital art and paintings. However, he adds, implementation has been stifled by corporate greed and oversaturation.\n\n�The problem is that these technologies have been reappropriated by businessmen to, instead of helping the artist, squeeze them out of the game,� he explained. �If you look at NFTs, it started out really interestingly with artists like Beeple becoming massive successes, and we started to think, �Wow, this is going to allow artists to become millionaires.� But what we saw within months, not even years, was that art became an auto-generated aesthetic that pushed the artist out of the project.�\n\nThe rise of NFTs coincided with the first editions of AI art, which allowed artists to create pieces within a matter of minutes. This led to the oversaturation of NFT marketplaces. Additionally, with the exception of a few creative artists like Beeple, the most successful NFT projects were those with appealing branding and prestige.\n\n\n\nAn obvious example of this is the aforementioned �Bored Ape Yacht Club�. It mass-produced JPEGs of the exact same ape in different outfits and colour schemes. It�s hard to argue that these easily reproducible two-dimensional sprites became worth up to US$3.4 million by being at the absolute cutting edge of creative digital artistry.\n\n�My question is � when it comes to Bored Apes, CryptoPunks and all the big projects that came out: how many artists came out of this besides a select few? The answer is: there�s hardly anyone,� Poujol said. �There should be an encyclopaedia of artists, but that�s not the case,� he added, noting that in many cases, the artists themselves were not well rewarded for their work, while the companies producing the NFTs were.\n\n�Grand promises that NFTs would put artists at the centre of the structured gain all disappeared,� he continued. �Apart from established artists, it was really difficult for emerging ones with no followers. It�s now a long shot, and what we saw with NFTs was actually a reappropriation of art for monetary purposes.�\n\n\n\nPoujol thinks that the increased sophistication of AI art has led to a digital-art NFT marketplace akin to a �Netflix on steroids�. With this level of oversaturation, it�s hard for an artist to stand out and find their own voice.\n\nBut with art becoming increasingly generic and uniform, Poujol thinks there is an opportunity for artists who make an effort to show the human element in their art.\n\nHe is still optimistic about NFTs and Web3 technology. In fact, they form a major part of Lumiere. For example, someone can purchase an NFT and use it to influence a decision in film production � say, over what type of shirt the lead actor wears in a certain scene.\n\n�This is what you can sell as an NFT, and this is the potential it has as a technology for the art world � not just a picture of a random celebrity, or a JPEG of apes, but real access and real experiences,� said Poujol.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the crypto crash got rid of a lot of the scammers and hype trains. What remains are real projects and real artists in it for the long-run. What�s more, as the market matures, there will hopefully be more deserving, hard-working artists who get the recognition and money they deserve.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen an incredible rally over the past few months, with bitcoin hitting an all-time high of US$73,800 in mid-March. If another major crypto bull run begins, could we see a resurgence of NFTs? If so, what will the new marketplace look like? Will prices be less volatile? Will valuations be based more on artistic merit than hype and status?\n\nThe answers to these questions remain to be seen, and it will be interesting to find out over the coming months.\n\n",

The key criteria for me is, is there substance behind the token? Has it got predictability?

They have the potential to reduce operational costs and promote efficiency and transparency, according to the Securities and Futures Commission.\n\n\n\nAccording to Quinn, tokenisation has shown to be cheaper, more efficient and better than �the old-fashioned way of trading�. There are more applications of tokenisation that the bank wants to explore.\n\n�We continue to invest in our tokenisation product line-up. I think tokenisation of gold and bond issues are good [examples],� he said. �I�m very comfortable with the concept of tokenisation.�\n\nWhile not mentioning specifics, Quinn said the bank will look at ways to tokenise assets that are �backed by something real�.\n\n\n\nGold and bonds are �a real asset�, whereas a cryptocurrency may be based on similar technology, but is more volatile and unpredictable. HSBC would be �staying away from crypto�, Quinn said.\n\nSpeaking at the HSBC Global Investment Summit last week, the city�s regulators were confident Hong Kong will be a world leader in tokenisation. Part of its efforts is the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nWhile still in its early days, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched the second phase of a pilot programme in March to explore use cases for a CBDC. Some of the use cases tested so far include online payments, payments in shops, the collection of government payouts, tokenised deposits, tokenised asset settlement and Web3 trading and clearing.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Hong Kong government completed the world�s first multicurrency digital bond offering worth around US$750 million last month. The bonds were directly issued onto HSBC Orion�s private blockchain as part of the HKMA�s Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU).\n\nThe blockchain-powered platform reduces the issuance settlement time from five days to one day and makes secondary market trade settlements and coupon payments easier, according to HSBC.\n\n�People are increasingly engaging in conversations about digital assets, and tokenised gold is one kind of asset that can be as liquid as conventional assets,� John O�Neill, the bank�s global head of digital assets strategy, said at the bank�s summit last week.\n\n",

    "content": "HSBC has launched tokenised gold to its retail customers in Hong Kong as part of a push by the bank and the government to make real-world assets available in digital form.\n\nHSBC Gold Token, which will become available today on the lender�s online banking and mobile app, is the first such retail product to be issued by a bank, according to HSBC, as the government pushes for more digital assets to be rolled out for public use.\n\nTokenised gold refers to physical gold whose ownership rights are stored digitally on a blockchain.\n\n�We acknowledge the rising demand for digital assets and the existing familiarity of our customers with gold investment,� said Maggie Ng, general manager and head of wealth and personal banking Hong Kong at HSBC.\n\nTokenised gold assets are not a new concept � they surpassed US$1 billion in value globally in 2023, according to CoinGecko, a platform that tracks the industry.\n\n�We are proud that HSBC Gold Token, powered by HSBC Orion, is the first retail product in Hong Kong that is based on distributed ledger technology, as authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC),� said Ng.\n\nHSBC Orion is the bank�s digital assets platform.\n\nThe new product comes after Hong Kong�s markets regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), released two circulars in November outlining requirements for tokenised products and assets to be offered to the public.\n\nTokenised products can be recorded digitally on the blockchain, offered directly to end-investors, distributed by intermediaries, or traded. They have the potential to reduce operational costs and promote efficiency and transparency, according to the SFC.\n\n�Asset tokenisation can enable convenient, affordable and broad access to real-world and financial assets, in this case, the HSBC Gold Token,� said Sami Abouzahr, Hong Kong head of investments and wealth solutions at HSBC.\n\nHSBC Gold Token is the first of a series of planned retail products that will use HSBC Orion.\n\nPreviously, the platform helped to tokenise physical gold in London for institutional investors and launch digital green bonds in Hong Kong.\n\nLast month, the Hong Kong government completed the world�s first multicurrency digital bond offering worth around US$750 million. The bonds were directly issued onto HSBC Orion�s private blockchain as part of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority�s Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU).\n\nThe blockchain-powered platform reduced the issuance settlement time from five days to one day and made secondary market trade settlements and coupon payments easier, according to HSBC.\n\n�Investors had the option to follow largely business-as-usual processes through traditional market infrastructure, i.e. the CMU in Hong Kong and its external linkages with [clearing houses],� Darryl Chan, deputy chief executive of the HKMA, said at an event staged by the International Capital Market Association in Hong Kong on Tuesday.\n\n�This has significantly broadened the bond�s investor base and enhanced its liquidity. It is fair to say that the issuance brought tokenised bonds further beyond proof-of-concept, towards achieving more common applications.�\n\nAt Tuesday�s Milken Institute Global Investors� Symposium, HSBC Hong Kong�s chief digital officer Bojan Obradovi? said the blockchain ledger has �strong potential to be a mainstream component of future financial markets�.\n\nHSBC is focusing on investing in distributed ledger technology, identifying which assets to develop as digital products, be it funds and bonds, tokens representing real-world assets or digital money, according to Obradovi?.\n\nAs well as working with the HKMA on its proposed central bank digital currency at the retail and wholesale levels, the lender is creating its own tokenised deposits and researching stablecoins.\n\nThe Hong Kong government is formulating a regulatory regime to sell stablecoins to retail investors. Stablecoins are cryptocurrency assets issued by private entities against a portfolio of traditional financial assets.\n\nObradovi? praised the government�s efforts to develop the sector.\n\n�Hong Kong has got a real opportunity to become the world�s leading digital asset hub,� he said.\n\n�How we get the buy and sell-side to come to Hong Kong and get real transactions to take place and have real economic value will be key.�\n\n",

    "summary": "The Securities and Futures Commission has warned of a fraudulent crypto trading platform called Quantum AI, a long-time scam that uses deepfakes of Elon Musk.\n\n",
    "content": "Last week, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) warned of a scam using deepfakes of Elon Musk touting a cryptocurrency trading platform called �Quantum AI�. The scam is old, but it highlights an alarming rise in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to commit fraud � and Asia has proven particularly susceptible.\n\nIn its public warning on May 8, the SFC said that Quantum AI makes claims of being able to earn �too-good-to-be-true� returns and the regulator made a request to the Hong Kong Police Force to block access to related websites and social media pages. The linked domains were inaccessible as of this week, and the Facebook groups appear to have been removed.\n\nThere have already been multiple cases of deepfake-related incidents of fraud in Hong Kong, putting the government on alert. Deepfake incidents in Asia-Pacific surged 1,530 per cent last year, with Vietnam and Japan seeing the most attacks, according to a report from identity verification platform Sumsub.\n\n�Thanks to increasing digital financial transactions in the emerging Asia market, there is a larger pool for deepfake targets,� said Penny Chai, Sumsub�s vice-president of business development in APAC. �Since a high volume of instant cross-border transactions takes place in the region, especially in Hong Kong, deepfake scammers can leverage the complexity and volume of financial dealings to carry out fraudulent activities.�\n\nThe Quantum AI scam dates back at least a year, although it seems to be recycled with different variations used to target different groups.\n\nOne video spread on Facebook last year, debunked by PolitiFact, featured Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, alongside Jack Ma � co-founder of Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the South China Morning Post � promoting the platform. It was modified from a video of Musk and Ma appearing together at the 2019 World AI Conference in Shanghai.\n\nAnother video was modified from an appearance Musk made on the Fox News show of conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, according to Reuters Fact Check.\n\nSome of the domains using the scheme rely on cheap hosting providers and flexible back-end technologies like WordPress. One of the top search results for Quantum AI is a website saying it requires a US$250 minimum deposit, accompanied by a warning that users should �invest only what you�re okay with losing completely�.\n\nIncidents of fraud using deepfakes � convincing simulacra of real people using generative AI � are on the rise. Sumsub � which tracks incidents of identity fraud, including through the use of deepfakes � detected a tenfold increase in the use of deepfakes last year, according to its Identity Fraud report.\n\nSumsub identified Hong Kong as one of the top five markets in Asia for identity fraud at a rate of 3.3 per cent last year. Bangladesh had the highest at 5.4 per cent.\n\nIn the first quarter, fintech industry fraud in Hong Kong grew at a rate of 3.8 per cent, which was 216 per cent faster than the rate in the same period a year earlier, Sumsub told the Post.\n\nDeepfakes have already caused tens of millions of dollars in losses in the city.\n\nIn 2020, a manager at a Japanese bank was fooled by fake audio mimicking his director�s voice into transferring US$35 million. Another multinational company lost US$25.6 million to a fraud involving a deepfake video call mimicking the likeness of the chief financial officer.\n\nThe SFC has become increasingly hawkish in flagging crypto-related scams on its website. Of the 29 suspicious virtual asset trading platforms listed by the SFC, 18 of the warnings were issued this year, and 24 of them were issued since JPEX scandal last September.\n\nThat incident tied the JPEX cryptocurrency exchange to the loss of roughly HK$1.5 billion (US$192 million), making it one of the largest financial frauds in the city�s history.\n\nThe regulator has also been more active in flagging other suspicious crypto-related products. On Monday, it warned of an investment product called LENA Network that involves cryptocurrency staking, borrowing and lending arrangements.\n\nArrangements for staking, which requires locking up a certain amount of crypto to validate transactions on a blockchain, could �amount to unauthorised collective investment schemes�, the SFC warned, and �may be highly risky�.\n\n",

    "content": "Canaan, a Singapore-based cryptocurrency-mining equipment maker, has unveiled in Hong Kong an energy-saving machine designed to help miners stay competitive after the rewards for mining bitcoin were reduced by 50 per cent after the recent �halving� event.\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed company launched the latest A1566 model of its flagship Avalon A15 series on Thursday at the Bitcoin Asia 2024 conference. The debut of the new mining rigs came weeks after bitcoin�s fourth halving event.\n\nOccuring roughly every four years, halving is an algorithmic instruction built into the bitcoin blockchain to manage the cryptocurrency�s supply and maintain its scarcity.\n\nThe latest halving event, which occurred on April 19, slashed the amount of bitcoin that miners receive for operating the powerful computers that verify transactions on the blockchain. That means older computers that are less energy-efficient will need to spend more on electricity to obtain the same quantity of bitcoin as before.\n\n�The bitcoin halving is a challenge, but also an opportunity, � said Davis Hui, vice-president at Canaan, in an interview with the Post.\n\nAs halving reduces the supply of new bitcoin, halving events have historically triggered a sharp rise in the cryptocurrency�s price. The past three halvings � in 2020, 2016 and 2012 � resulted in an average price increase of 16 per cent over the following 60 days, according to 10x Research, a digital asset consultancy.\n\n�That�s why we chose this timing to launch our new bitcoin-mining machines to help our miners get through this time�s halving,� Hui said. The new machine can compute more data, while consuming less energy compared to previous models, he said.\n\nDespite the latest halving event, bitcoin prices have been on a downward trend in recent weeks, as the US Federal Reserve puts off cutting interest rates.\n\nCanaan last year reported a 67.5 per cent plunge in total revenue to US$211.5 million, citing lower selling price of its equipment because of �overall soft purchasing power from the market demand front�. Mining equipment sales revenue fell 71.5 per cent to US$175.9 million, according to the company�s financial statement.\n\n�While we acknowledge the persisting challenges of the ongoing bearish market for mining machines, we draw inspiration from the recent approval and listing of spot bitcoin ETFs,� said Nangeng Zhang, chairman and CEO of Canaan.\n\nHong Kong�s spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the first of its kind in Asia, debuted last week, after 11 US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in January following a green light from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFounded in 2013, Canaan has businesses in the US, Canada, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, with over 20 maintenance support sites around the world.\n\n",

    "summary": "Her brand L�Dezen was one of the first jewellery companies to incorporate NFTs, enabling customers to assume both physical and digital ownership of pieces � but these days Shah is more interested in AI\n\n",
    "content": "Payal Shah is deeply entrenched in Hong Kong�s art and tech scenes. Her jewellery company L�Dezen, founded more than 12 years ago, was one of the first to incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFTs), allowing customers to assume both physical and digital ownership of her pieces.\n\nShah, who has over 115,000 followers on Instagram, has always been both artistic and tech-savvy. She is one of the most vocal voices on X posting about Web3, and was named by Tatler Asia as one of the 30 most influential women in the NFT space. Now, she�s one of the most influential female voices on artificial intelligence (AI) in Hong Kong.\n\nShe attributes much of the success of L�Dezen and her own personal brand to her dedication to following the latest tech trends. �In this competitive world, you have to find ways to grow and stay ahead of the curve,� said Shah. �If you�re constantly involved in what�s available and innovating, then all of a sudden you�re keeping your brand relevant, and that gives you a competitive edge that you�d normally need to pay millions of dollars for.�\n\n\n\nRecently, Shah�s focus has shifted away from Web3 and NFTs to AI. Though she still likes the core ideals of NFTs, namely the idea of giving ownership back to the artist without the influence of a third-party entity, she feels that things haven�t unfolded the way she had originally hoped, at least thus far.\n\n�I love the conversations and I love it from the artist�s perspective, being an artist and jeweller myself, but I don�t know if there�s going to be mainstream adoption any time soon,� she said. �The onboarding process is still too much of a hurdle for people to have a cryptocurrency wallet as easily as they�d have, say, an Apple Wallet. And because of all of the scammers in the industry, I have some artist friends who say they would never touch it.�\n\nShah now regularly hosts seminars and workshops with a focus on educating artists and entrepreneurs about how to use AI. �Research is a huge part of the design process � what the latest trends are or where they�re headed, and AI makes that process way more efficient,� she explained. �You�re creating with the idea of: yeah, I�m an artist, but I want to make sure this art converts into sales, so I need to incorporate data. So I�ll find out, how much do my potential customers spend per year on jewellery? What�s the material of the year? And so on.�\n\n\n\nAs a boot camp and training organiser at Female Entrepreneurs Worldwide, one of Shah�s main passions is educating women about AI. �I don�t want AI to be completely male dominated the way Web3 was; I really want AI to include all genders,� she explained.\n\nAnother reason Shah wants female entrepreneurs and artists to become more tech-savvy is that she thinks that AI is both more important and more transformative than Web3, especially in the art space. �If you completely ignored Web3 [during the peak mania phase], you�d still be completely fine,� she said. �But you can�t ignore AI. The phone you�re using probably uses AI. Most of the apps you use are already using AI. That�s why education, especially for women, is so important.�\n\nShah does her best to keep her workshops fun and playful, while teaching important skills like prompt engineering, data analysis, as well as going over the latest trends and developments in the space. Though Shah is an AI optimist, she understands the concerns that a lot of artists have about generative AI art and the ease with which art can be produced by AI programs; concerns about whether AI generated art is �real�; and the potential threat to the livelihood of artists who have spent years perfecting their craft.\n\n\n\nShe, like many others, is especially concerned about OpenAI�s latest project, Sora � an AI-powered, text-to-video model that will allow people to make films in a matter of minutes. �What usually requires 30 people to get on set for photoshoots and video shoots, and their whole livelihoods are based on this � a lot of it is going to get wiped out thanks to Sora, and the number of shows and films is going to be overwhelming,� Shah said.\n\nWhile she understands the sentiment that artists share, Shah added, �[AI is] not a real person: it�s just mimicking a bunch of different people�s information that�s been given, and turning that into art.� She believes that art with a human touch will be at a premium, and her advice to young and upcoming artists is to never let their art lose its human element.\n\n�You can think of the AI as a second brain,� she continued. �An amazing, high-IQ assistant, but your brain has to be involved, and you have to give the AI something human and relevant when prompting � and that will always require you to work and do your own research.�\n\n",

The exchange estimates that it has between US$14.5 billion and US$16.3 billion to distribute to them.\n\nThe filing said that after paying claims in full, the plan provides for supplemental interest payments to creditors, to the extent that funds still remain. The interest rate for most creditors is 9 per cent.\n\nThat may be a diminished consolation for investors who were trading cryptocurrency on the exchange when it collapsed.\n\nWhen FTX sought bankruptcy protection in November 2022, bitcoin was going for US$16,080. But cryptocurrency prices have soared as the economy recovered while the assets at FTX were sorted out over the past two years.\n\nA single bitcoin on Tuesday was selling for close to US$62,675. That comes out to a 290 per cent loss, a bit less than that if accrued interest is counted, if those investors had held onto those coins.\n\nCustomers and creditors that claim US$50,000 or less will get about 118 per cent of their claim, according to the plan, which was filed with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. This covers about 98 per cent of FTX customers.\n\nFTX said that it was able to recover funds by monetising a collection of assets that mostly consisted of proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims.\n\nFTX was the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world when it filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2022 after it experienced the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank run.\n\nCEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried resigned when the exchange collapsed. In March, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the massive fraud that occurred at FTX.\n\nBankman-Fried was convicted in November of fraud and conspiracy � a dramatic fall from a crest of success that included a Super Bowl advertisement, testimony before Congress and celebrity endorsements from stars like quarterback Tom Brady, basketball point guard Stephen Curry and comedian Larry David.\n\nThe company appointed as its new CEO John Ray III, a long-time bankruptcy litigator who is best known for having to clean up the mess made after the collapse of Enron.\n\n�We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100 per cent of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,� Ray said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe bankruptcy court is set to hold a hearing on June 25.\n\n",

Fung said he is �not privy to the details surrounding their recent decision�. He did not say why he decided to leave the company.\n\nHKVAEX did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\nThe closure comes just over a year since the company launched its virtual asset trading platform (VATP) in February 2023, securing its position as a pre-existing service provider so that it would have a one-year window to apply for a licence after a new regulation from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) took effect in June. The exchange submitted its application in January, well ahead of the February 29 deadline, but the SFC�s website shows that it was withdrawn on March 28.\n\nThe company�s ties to Binance have raised questions about whether it would be able to successfully secure a licence, especially after the crypto giant was found guilty of breaking US anti-money-laundering laws.\n\nThe Post reported last October that Binance was behind HKVAEX, which was set up as a separate entity in Hong Kong and shares digital resources with the world�s largest crypto exchange. Binance has said that HKVAEX is �not in the Binance Group of companies�.\n\nIts retreat from the market leaves Binance as the only major crypto player founded in China that does not have an affiliate or subsidiary pursuing a VATP licence in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong entity under OKX submitted an application last November and Huobi HK, under HBGL Hong Kong, submitted in February.\n\nHTX, formerly Huobi, said Huobi HK operates independently. Before taking over as head of HKVAEX, Fung was CEO of Huobi HK.\n\nHKVAEX did not give a reason for deciding to shut down before the SFC�s application process had concluded. Beyond its ties to Binance, though, VATP operators have expressed concerns about the high compliance costs for getting a licence in Hong Kong, in addition to requirements such as cold storage reserves that are even greater than what is required in neighbouring markets like Singapore.\n\nStill, Fung said he remains �highly optimistic� about the city�s Web3 industry. �I continue to see Hong Kong as a future hub for these technologies and I�m excited about the opportunities this presents,� he said.\n\n",

    "content": "Cryptocurrency exchanges are eating into Binance�s share of bitcoin trading outside the US as overseas expansion efforts and changing regulations reshape the competitive dynamics of the digital-asset industry.\n\nOver the past year, the world�s largest crypto exchange saw its share of such bitcoin trading drop to 55.3 per cent from 81.3 per cent, according to research firm Kaiko. For smaller tokens known as altcoins, the proportion fell to 50.5 per cent from 58 per cent.\n\nKaiko pegged the changes to Binance�s decision to end a promotion that scrapped trading fees. �Offshore markets have become less concentrated, with smaller exchanges gaining momentum as trade volumes recovered,� the company�s analysts wrote in a note.\n\nPlatforms like Bybit and OKX have expanded their footprints in regions such as Asia, while Binance has been grappling with the fallout of legal issues. The company and its co-founder Zhao Changpeng pleaded guilty to US anti-money-laundering and sanctions violations in November last year.\n\nBybit�s share of non-US bitcoin trading reached 9.3 per cent over the past year, up from 2 per cent, according to Kaiko. OKX accounts for 7.3 per cent currently, up from 3 per cent.\n\nBinance has been trying to rebuild its reputation while operating under the watchful gaze of US regulators. Under new boss Richard Teng � a former regulator in Singapore � the exchange has tightened token listing rules and appointed a board of directors.\n\nThe digital-asset industry as a whole has benefited from a fourfold jump in the bitcoin price since the start of last year. The rebound from a 2022 rout took the token to a record high of US$73,798 last month, catalysing trading volumes.\n\n",

    "content": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain, made a rare last-minute appearance at a Hong Kong crypto conference on Tuesday, despite previously expressing scepticism about the city�s commitment to supporting the industry.\n\nButerin gave two keynote speeches at the Hong Kong Web3 Festival on Tuesday, the final day of the four-day event, focusing on blockchain technology. His in-person attendance came as a surprise to many, as it was only announced by the conference on Monday evening.\n\nThe entrepreneur, regarded as a major figure in crypto communities because of his influence over one of the world�s most widely used blockchains, last year cautioned industry players about setting up shop in Hong Kong, suggesting the stability of the city�s new-found support for virtual assets as of the end of 2022 could be fickle.\n\n\n\n�Obviously it�s very friendly now,� Buterin said at the Web3 Transitions Summit in Singapore in September 2023. �But the big question I�m asking, and I think [everyone] is asking, is how stable is the level of friendliness.�\n\nHe added that if a crypto project wants to make Hong Kong their home, it would need to be confident that the city will continue to be friendly to the sector many years from now, �when all kinds of unknown, regulatory and political events are going to happen�.\n\nButerin acknowledged at the time that he does not �understand Hong Kong well�, and even less the �complicated interaction between Hong Kong and the mainland lately�.\n\nHis comments prompted a response from Hong Kong lawmaker Johnny Ng Kit-chong, who said on X, formerly Twitter, that �Hong Kong�s policies and laws will not change overnight�, and dismissed the idea of any complications because Beijing supports the �one country, two systems� arrangement that allows the city some policy autonomy. Commercial use of cryptocurrency is strictly banned in mainland China.\n\nNg also invited Buterin to �come to Hong Kong to understand the situation�.\n\nButerin is one of the few heavyweight speakers who attended the Hong Kong event this year, as the city increased its efforts to woo international crypto talent and businesses with the goal of becoming a virtual asset hub. The hall was completely packed with crypto faithful at an event where attendance had been patchy most days.\n\nHis talk, however, was just over 20 minutes and dealt strictly with technical upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain. He then left as quickly as he appeared, taking no questions.\n\nInvestor Cathie Wood, founder of US funds manager ARK Invest, dialled in remotely on the first day of the conference. In an onstage interview with HashKey Capital, she applauded Hong Kong�s virtual asset policy initiatives and suggested that the US is lagging behind. The investor also gave a highly optimistic view of bitcoin�s future, predicting that the token will trade at US$1.5 million by 2030.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino�s new venture Holepunch has launched a peer-to-peer messaging app called Keet to aid the mission of �financial freedom�.\n\n",
    "content": "The CEO of Tether, the world�s largest stablecoin, is developing a new peer-to-peer technology that he hopes will further wrest financial control from big institutions, and the cryptocurrency giant he heads is pouring millions of dollars into it.\n\nTether intends to invest tens of millions of dollars into a new peer-to-peer chat and video conferencing app called Keet to make it �one of three most known communication applications in the world�, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether and co-founder of Keet developer Holepunch, told the Post in an interview.\n\nBuilt on a new peer-to-peer protocol called Pear Runtime, which Holepunch launched two months ago, the absence of any middleman or centralised server aligns with the ethos of Tether and Ardoino, who said he seeks to offer greater financial freedom.\n\n�[At Tether] we are bitcoiners at heart. We believe in the bitcoin mission that is bringing financial freedom to the world,� Ardoino said in a chat conducted over Keet on Wednesday. �If you have financial freedom, but you don�t have freedom of speech � we are not really free, right?�\n\n\n\nTether was started in Hong Kong 10 years ago and has since transformed into a critical component of Web3, often as a main source of liquidity for other cryptocurrencies because of its peg to the US dollar. Tether still has an active corporate entity in Hong Kong, according to government records, but Ardoino said it is �dormant� and the company no longer has personnel in the city.\n\nWith Tether now the world�s default blockchain-based dollar, Ardoino sees his new venture as taking on technology giants such as Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and WhatsApp, and Google. As a peer-to-peer technology, Pear Runtime eliminates the need for expensive server infrastructure, freeing developers to focus on building the apps, Ardoino said.\n\nIts ability to do this hinges on the backing of Tether, which Ardoino noted made more than US$6 billion in profit last year.\n\n�We don�t care to make more money,� he said. �We are investing in � companies that are aligned with the vision of bringing freedom and creating tools that are ready for the apocalypse.�\n\nKeet, built in-house by Holepunch, is the first flagship tool using Pear Runtime. Like other peer-to-peer apps, users connect directly to other computers, so their internet protocol (IP) addresses are exposed to others in a chat room � although Keet does not directly make that information visible in the app. However, Ardoino said messages are end-to-end encrypted and traffic cannot be publicly monitored, so only the people a user chats with can see those addresses.\n\nThe company is not able to share developer statistics for the same reason, according to Holepunch CEO Mathias Buus Madsen. But there is �definitely a big percentage� coming from Asia, including India and �the Hong Kong area�, he said.\n\nThe app has already built in some cryptocurrency functionality by including a Lightning wallet. The Lightning Network is a so-called layer 2 payment protocol on the bitcoin blockchain that allows for fast and cheap transfers of small amounts of bitcoin. The Holepunch team is also working fast to integrate Tether, also known as USDT.\n\n�Bitcoin is the unstoppable money, and Keet is the unstoppable app. That�s why we thought it�s more appropriate to have bitcoin first,� Ardoino said. �Nevertheless, USDT will come probably soon, in the next few months.�\n\nAs the crypto sector rebounds from the 2022 crash, the total market value of Tether�s USDT stablecoin surpassed US$100 billion last month and now sits at about US$106 billion, according to data on CoinGecko. The total value of stablecoins in circulation stands at US$152 billion, giving Tether a nearly 70 per cent market share, according to market tracker DefiLlama.\n\nIts outsize presence in the industry has also invited increasing scrutiny in recent years and criticism of a lack of transparency about the reserves backing USDT.\n\nTether Holdings, now based in the British Virgin Islands, has traditionally revealed little information about itself. It was started by the same people behind the crypto exchange Bitfinex, where Ardoino serves as chief technology officer (CTO). Ardoino joined Bitfinex as a software developer in October 2014 and became CTO of Tether in 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nTether has been publishing quarterly attestations of its reserves, and in October the company told Bloomberg that it would start publishing data on its reserves in real time. Ardoino did not share a timeline for that when asked, but said that a full audit remains challenging because the 2022 collapse of FTX made major accounting firms more hesitant to work with major crypto firms for fear of reputational risks.\n\n�FTX didn�t make our life easier,� he said.\n\nAnother source of controversy has been the widespread use of USDT in cybercrime.\n\nArdoino slammed some of the reporting that has been done on Tether in recent years, saying the company works with the US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigations and Secret Service to track criminals using USDT.\n\n�You have to be a really, really stupid criminal to use Tether,� Ardoino said, pointing to the transparency of its data because it is run on a public blockchain.\n\nMembers of criminal gangs using slave labour in place like Myanmar may not fear legal repercussions in countries they will never visit. This is just one reason law enforcement agencies are concerned about the increasing use of encrypted services that hide traces of illegal activity.\n\nMeanwhile, financial regulators have raised concerns about the impact of stablecoins on financial stability owing to issues such as capital flight. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced stablecoin regulations for public consultation in December that would require issuers to get licensed.\n\nTether is also �following the development of regulations� in Hong Kong, Ardoino said, adding that it is in discussions with local firms to explore ways to engage the Hong Kong market.\n\nAsked if he thinks an app like Keet could accelerate illegal money flows or impact financial stability, Ardoino demurred.\n\n�USDT helps the last mile. Those are the people [whose] entire wealth is US$100 and they don�t have a bank account,� he said. �Bankers don�t care about us.�\n\nStill, Ardoino made it clear that there is an ideological component underpinning the new P2P protocol. He pointed to a quote by the Joker in Christopher Nolan�s second Batman film The Dark Knight that �reflects well� the mission of Keet.\n\n�It�s not about money; it�s about sending a message.�\n\n",

They are accused of carrying out the lightning-fast heist, plotted over the course of months, from their keyboards last year.\n\n�The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialised skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe,� Damian Williams, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement.\n\nThe two studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with Anton graduating in February with a Bachelor of Science in computer science and math and James graduating with a Master of Science in aeronautics and astronautics in 2021.\n\nLawyers for the Peraire-Bueno brothers didn�t immediately respond to a request for comment. The brothers, who were arrested Tuesday in Boston and New York.\n\nThe US Justice Department has been focused on stamping out fraud and misconduct in the cryptocurrency industry, winning convictions of several high-profile industry executives, most notably Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, who also went to MIT.\n\nEthereum is known as the biggest commercial highway in cryptocurrency, used by thousands of apps and focused on everything from finance to gaming.\n\nThe US says the brothers set up something called validators, which are designed to help order transactions on the Ethereum network and to help bots make money by facilitating arbitrage and other profitable trades.\n\nInstead, they put their own validators in place to deceive the traders operating the bots, according to prosecutors.\n\nThey secured access to pending transactions and altered the movement of electronic currency to steal the cryptocurrency, the government alleges. The pair then moved the cryptocurrency through a web of transactions in an attempt to hide the source of the funds, according to the US.\n\nThe two allegedly spent months planning the heist, including studying the trading behaviours of Ethereum bots and setting up shell companies to operate behind.\n\nThey searched online for cryptocurrency exchanges with limited �know your customer� procedures they could use to launder their ill-gotten gains and even researched extradition procedures, prosecutors say.\n\n",

    "content": "A close aide of a Dubai prince who suddenly postponed the opening ceremony of his Hong Kong family office has a history of unsuccessful blockchain ventures and was involved in a solar plant deal in the United States that collapsed due to a lack of funding, public records show.\n\nSheikh Ali Rashed Ali Saeed Al Maktoum, reportedly the nephew of Dubai�s ruler and prime minister, grabbed headlines earlier this month when he pledged to open a US$500 million family office in Hong Kong and made appearances at high-profile events in the city over the past week.\n\nBut he unexpectedly pushed back the opening ceremony of the office by two months and questions have swirled about his business track record and connections to the ruling family.\n\nScrutiny has now fallen on his close aides, including the office�s director of international strategic relations William Tien, also known as Tien Chwan Hoa.\n\nTien was involved in the blockchain-based digital wallet TiENPAY that folded and was a director of a company tied to a solar plant deal in Arizona that imploded when a newspaper expos� revealed the backers could not provide the financing.\n\nIn explaining Thursday�s postponement of the launch ceremony of Maktoum�s family office at the eleventh hour, his private office pointed to �some urgent matters in Dubai that needed his attention�.\n\n�It has been confirmed that the operation of the sheikh�s family office in Hong Kong will proceed as planned,� the office said on Friday evening. �It is merely the inauguration ceremony that has been planned will now be postponed until Sheikh Ali Al Maktoum comes [to] town again at the end of May.�\n\nMaktoum also expressed his �sincere gratitude� to the Hong Kong government, including the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau and InvestHK, for their help in establishing his office in the city, and apologised for any inconvenience caused.\n\nThe statement did not elaborate on the urgent matters that led to the abrupt delay and did not address the prince�s business experience or family ties.\n\n\n\nThe private office�s website was created less than a year ago, with the domain name registered on May 29, 2023, through Domains by Proxy, according to whois records.\n\nCommunications with the press have been managed by Eleanor Jane Mak, vice-chairman and CEO of the prince�s family office. She remains a director of China New Energy Skyrail International and nine other locally registered companies.\n\nRepresentatives of the prince�s office, according to the Friday evening statement, have been in contact with China New Energy Skyrail, which has previously advanced a monorail project for the Kai Tak development area in Hong Kong. The office said its staff had visited Beijing, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Guangzhou and Chengdu in mainland China to explore opportunities.\n\nWilliam Tien was the representative who signed a cooperation deal with the Hang Seng University of Hong Kong on behalf of the office on Tuesday.\n\nThe entrepreneur, who identifies himself as the president and CEO of the US-based Axis Technologies Group on his LinkedIn account, is no stranger to setting up businesses in Hong Kong, holding directorships in at least seven locally registered companies under the name �Tien Chwan Hoa�.\n\nTien was a director of TiENPAY, which was dissolved last year. TiENPAY labelled itself a software developer involved in mobile wallet and blockchain projects, as well as the crypto-to-crypto digital exchange T8EX. The TiENPAY website is no longer accessible.\n\nTiENPAY was previously known as Zentric (HK) and had entered into an engineering, procurement and construction agreement with Matinee Energy to build solar power plants in Benson, Arizona, in January of 2012, according to a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission made that year.\n\n\n\nThe solar project later ran into trouble and Zentric�s lack of a track record in the field was exposed in a bombshell report by the Phoenix New Times, which described the two US-based companies headed by Tien at the time � including Alpha Lujo � as �broke�.\n\nZentric reportedly pulled out of the project �just before press time� after the Arizona newspaper made email inquiries, with Tien claiming in a letter that his firm was �unable to arrange for sufficient financing� to meet the project�s deadlines.\n\nContractors of the project have since launched legal battles against executives of Matinee Energy demanding compensation, which Zentric and Tien were not involved in.\n\nOne of Tien�s newest ventures is Asian Carbon Holdings, which was incorporated last October, two months before the prince�s previous visit to Hong Kong. Tien had touted his experience in green sectors when being interviewed as chairman of Asian Carbon Holdings last December.\n\n�I started working on carbon capture and storage projects in 2009, and it has become more and more common in the past few years. They call it carbon neutralisation in China. So we have rich experience in this industry,� he told a broadcaster at an event that the prince attended as well.\n\nIn the interview he suggested a project to facilitate carbon credit trading through blockchain tokenisation of real-world assets. The idea seemed to align with a plan of Maktoum�s office to focus on �sustainable business ties between the UAE and Asia�.\n\nTien is a Singaporean passport holder with a correspondence address at a residential block at a housing estate in the city state, according to a new filing made this month for a Hong Kong company called Space Node Lab.\n\nHe listed a pair of US and Singapore mobile numbers on his business card for his role in the prince�s family office, though the former could not be reached and the latter was not in use. The Post has reached out to Tien by email.\n\nThe Dubai prince�s ambitious investment plan attracted considerable attention and interest from mainland Chinese enterprises, but some raised concerns after finding scarce public information about him.\n\n\n\nQuestions about Maktoum�s relationship with the prime minister were also raised by academics who study the history of the royal families of the Gulf states.\n\nTwo sources with knowledge of the royals said Maktoum was from a �distant branch� of the ruling family. The UAE consulate earlier confirmed that Maktoum was �from the ruling family� and �a sheikh� � an honorific title designating a royal family member.\n\nIn the first statement issued on Friday, Maktoum�s office also painted the 28-year-old as a �visionary leader and patriot of cultural arts dedicated to fostering positive changes that extend beyond the borders of Dubai� and highlighted his recent appointment as an honorary professor in sustainability leadership at Hang Seng University.\n\n�Sheikh Ali Al Maktoum believes that the opening of his family office in Hong Kong is just the start of his global public service,� it added.\n\nHang Seng University told the Post on Friday that the delayed opening of the office would have no impact on the operation of the Asia-Pacific Asean Green Deal Centre.\n\nThe Hong Kong government distanced itself from the matter on Thursday, saying it would not comment on the business activities of individuals.\n\nThe prince had spoken at a key family office summit in Hong Kong a day earlier, co-organised by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and InvestHK.\n\n",

    "content": "Hong Kong and Shenzhen have begun to test cross-border information verification between the two cities, as they take early steps in enabling the exchange of business data across the Greater Bay Area (GBA), starting with the financial industry.\n\nThe first phase of the pilot trial will focus on the cross-border verification of credit reports by credit reference agencies and commercial banks, according to a statement published on Monday by WeBank, the Shenzhen-based virtual lender providing the technology underpinning the data-flow platform.\n\nAs China moves to build a legal and regulatory mechanism to screen data entering and leaving the mainland border, observers have warned that stringent requirements, including security assessments, could hurt Hong Kong�s role as a base for foreign investors to manage their mainland operations.\n\nThe new data-verification platform will test Beijing�s plan to keep watch on cross-border data flows without disrupting normal business operations.\n\nAs part of the trial, Shenzhen Credit Services and Nova Credit in Hong Kong will use the platform to verify corporate credit reports. Shenzhen-based Baihang Credit Services and Fusion Bank in Hong Kong will use it to verify credit information. Hong Kong�s Bank of East Asia will use the platform to conduct credit checks of customers at its mainland and Hong Kong branches.\n\nCredit verification is an important step for banks and financial institutions to assess clients, but the process has been interrupted by restrictions on cross-border data transfers between the mainland and Hong Kong.\n\nThe pilot programme, which aims to build the infrastructure needed to support cross-border digital services, will make life and work more convenient for residents, as well as companies looking to expand their businesses, according to the announcement.\n\nThe platform marks another step forward in strengthening data cooperation across the GBA, which is the Chinese government�s scheme to link Hong Kong, Macau and nine cities in southern Guangdong province into an integrated economic and business hub.\n\nIn December, the Hong Kong government said it planned to launch a pilot programme for the cross-border transfer of data, covering areas such as health and banking, after the city in July agreed with the Cyberspace Administration of China on draft rules governing the safe flow of data within the GBA.\n\nBuilt on distributed data-transfer protocols and the mainland blockchain platform FISCO BCOS, the data-verification platform will conduct verifications using hash values, which are unique digital fingerprints assigned to data. The platform does not transfer or store cross-border data, according to WeBank.\n\nThe programme is expected to cover more sectors in the future, including cross-border healthcare and daily-life services, the bank said.\n\n",

US District Judge Richard Jones is expected to sentence Zhao on April 30.\n\nOnce the most powerful figure in the crypto industry, Zhao, 47, stepped down as Binance�s chief last November, when he and the exchange admitted to evading anti-money-laundering requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nBinance agreed to a US$4.32 billion criminal penalty.\n\nProsecutors said Binance, employing a �Wild West� model that welcomed criminals, did not report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups including Hamas, al-Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.\n\nThey also said Zhao�s platform supported the sale of child sexual abuse materials and was a recipient of a large portion of ransomware proceeds.\n\n�He made a business decision that violating US law was the best way to attract users, build his company and line his pockets,� prosecutors said.\n\nIn seeking leniency, Zhao�s lawyers cited the first-time offender�s �unflinching� acceptance of responsibility, his US$50 million criminal fine and that no defendant in a remotely similar case has been imprisoned.\n\nThey also said Zhao made Binance an industry leader on compliance, �despite the initial failures that led to this prosecution�. Zhao founded Binance in 2017.\n\nHe has been free on a US$175 million bond, and agreed not to appeal any sentence within federal guidelines.\n\n\n\nBinance�s penalty included a US$1.81 billion criminal fine and US$2.51 billion of restitution. Zhao also paid US$50 million to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, his lawyers said.\n\nThe case is US v. Zhao, US District Court, Western District of Washington, No 23-cr-00179.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Spot bitcoin and ether ETFs in Asia could be attractive to investors looking to avoid US tax laws, but the market is still relatively �tiny�.\n\n",
    "content": "Hong Kong�s upcoming exchange-traded funds (ETF) that invest directly into cryptocurrencies could be attractive to many Asian investors, industry insiders say, but demand may still be a trickle compared with that in the US.\n\nHong Kong�s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Monday gave the green light to multiple mainland Chinese fund houses and local virtual asset firms to move forward with their applications to offer ETFs that invest directly in bitcoin and ether, the world�s two largest crypto tokens.\n\nThe move, which came only a few months after Hong Kong regulators announced plans to allow spot crypto ETFs, was hailed as a major milestone in the city�s pursuit to become a global virtual asset hub. It also gave the market a rare lead over the US, which has yet to make a decision on allowing spot ether ETFs.\n\n�We can expect a healthy level of interest, especially with other Asian jurisdictions staying away from domestic spot bitcoin ETF issuance for now,� said Angela Ang, senior policy adviser at blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs in the US, which were approved in January, are also available worldwide, but many Asian investors may prefer to avoid the hurdle of opening a US investment account and paying the country�s capital gains tax, said Michael Wong, a partner at the law firm Dechert LLP in Hong Kong.\n\n�It�s just more convenient for Hong Kong investors or probably Asian investors generally, who don�t want to open a US brokerage account,� Wong said.\n\nJust the fact of having to fill out US tax forms could be a deterrent for some investors looking for exposure to bitcoin, according to Wong, who also noted that Hong Kong does not tax capital gains.\n\nHong Kong�s impending approval of bitcoin and ether ETFs is also a �milestone for the digital asset industry at large�, as it �creates an additional regulated avenue for price exposure to the asset class with the ability to trade within the Asian time zone�, said Chengyi Ong, head of APAC policy at blockchain research firm Chainalysis.\n\nOng noted that demand for price exposure to virtual assets is strong in Asia, which accounted for US$791 billion of the US$1.17 trillion of bitcoin traded in February this year, according to data by crypto news and data outlet The Block. North American investors traded US$113 billion in bitcoin that month.\n\nUltimately, though, demand for the Hong Kong products will come down to the size of the local market, the fees charged, and similar factors, Ong said.\n\n�Expense ratio will definitely be something that investors will look at,� said Dechert�s Wong. �If you have a comparable or competitive expense ratio for [Hong Kong�s spot crypto] ETFs, then I�m sure that it will be very appealing to a lot of the investors.�\n\nOthers have been more dismissive of the new products. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on X, formerly Twitter, that the offering is �child�s play� compared with similar products in the US because Hong Kong is a comparatively �tiny� market. �Don�t expect a lot of flows,� he wrote.\n\nFirms planning to launch spot crypto ETFs in Hong Kong should now work on fulfilling other requirements before offering them, such as applying to list them on the local stock exchange, as they await for the SFC�s final approval, according to the regulator. Wong estimated that the ETFs could launch by June.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The Web3 video gaming unicorn has signed an MOU with Saudi Arabia�s state-backed science park, months after a US$50 million investment in its Neom smart city.\n\n",
    "content": "Animoca Brands is looking to enter the ground floor of Web3 development in Saudi Arabia after recently signing a memorandum of understanding with the country�s primary scientific research centre, said company co-founder and chairman Yat Siu in an interview.\n\nThe Hong Kong-based blockchain gaming unicorn recently expanded its cooperation in Saudi Arabia with a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), which it signed during the Leap conference in Riyadh earlier this month. Hong Kong Science and Technology Park (HKSTP) and Cyberport also signed MOUs with KACST during the event.\n\nAnimoca, though, was one of the few start-ups at Leap focused on what it sees as a burgeoning opportunity in the Web3 market, especially in gaming. The company is already an investor in the Neom smart city project in the northwest of the country. Having long been involved in the United Arab Emirates, where Dubai has made itself a regional Web3 hub, Animoca now sees an opportunity to be part of an even earlier stage of development.\n\n�Most of our investments are all over the world. But our priority in terms of building out infrastructure and building out business operations is definitely Saudi,� Siu said. �Also, Saudi is a market in itself, with a very strong gaming population.�\n\n\n\nSiu noted that Dubai is primarily an export-driven market, whereas Saudi Arabia has some of the highest average revenues per user (ARPU) in the world.\n\nAn estimate from Statista Market Insights put Saudi Arabia�s ARPU across all video game segments last year at US$370.90, far exceeding the global average of US$200.60 and dwarfing most Southeast Asian markets.\n\nVideo gaming ARPU in the Philippines was estimated at US$87.74 last year, US$100.20 in Malaysia and US$83.50 in Vietnam. Brunei and Thailand were the only countries in the region to have exceeded global gaming ARPU last year at US$303.70 and US$252, respectively.\n\nThe question for a company like Animoca is whether Web3 gaming specifically will take off. There are signs that it has weathered some of the worst industry storms.\n\nOne Animoca portfolio game called Pixels has become a huge hit in the Philippines, where people harvest virtual crops to earn crypto tokens as extra income, The New York Times reported this week. About 30 per cent of crypto-earning gamers live in the country, the game�s developers told the Times. Animoca led a US$2.4 million funding round for Pixels in 2022.\n\n�The thesis is playing out as we hoped it would,� Siu said. �Places like the Philippines, Southeast Asia are hotspots of innovation for the Web3 gaming space, in particular because they appreciate capitalism and the opportunities around what digital property rights mean.�\n\n�Southeast Asia is a growing market with an established framework,� he added. �Whereas in Saudi we literally have to design the frameworks.�\n\nThe challenge to overcome in the next stage of Web3 development could be convincing gamers that blockchain really will revolutionise ownership of in-game assets. Metaverse luminaries like writer Matthew Ball have touted the idea that blockchain will eventually transform gaming by allowing assets to be transferable between platforms.\n\nSo far, Web3 gaming has been relegated to graphically simple casual games like Pixels, which Siu noted is how mobile gaming started too.\n\n�The AAA titles are obviously high-value entertainment, but there�s also the casual element,� he said. �It was the casual games that brought adoption to mobile before we got into Call of Duty, which will come.�\n\nAnimoca�s biggest bet on AAA � a designation for high-budget blockbuster titles typically associated with open-world, 3D gameplay � is Phantom Galaxies, a shoot-�em-up in space that launched in May last year from subsidiary Blowfish Studios.\n\nIn November, it launched on the online game store Steam, where players have given it middling reviews. However, the Steam version has stripped out the Web3 elements, as the world�s largest gaming platform banned blockchain games in 2021.\n\nSiu acknowledged that last year was tough because of declining crypto valuations. The market tanked after a series of bankruptcies and scandals in 2022. Much of the company�s financial holdings are in crypto assets, which it divides into liquid and off-balance-sheet reserves, including Sand, the native token of The Sandbox, the metaverse platform owned by Animoca.\n\nThe market has seen a huge rebound in the new year, with bitcoin hitting a record price of US$73,800 this week.\n\n�Obviously 2023 was a difficult year�, but so far this year �values have increased dramatically�, Siu said. �It�s going to have a material impact.�\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "While there were fewer exhibitors this year, the Web3 Festival has attracted a more international crowd with 80 per cent of participants from outside the city.\n\n",
    "content": "Attendance is down, but enthusiasm is up at Hong Kong�s Web3 Festival this year amid sky-high bitcoin prices that have helped draw in an even greater proportion of overseas participants compared with last year.\n\nThe vast majority of participants � an estimated 80 per cent � came from outside Hong Kong, said Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong Wai-lun on Saturday in his opening remarks. The 2024 conference has seen more exhibitors from Europe and the US specifically, according to Lu Weiding, CEO of Wanxiang Group, which owns the event organiser HashKey Group.\n\nAs Hong Kong forges ahead with its push to transform into a major crypto hub, it has been attracting more Web3 events to the city and trying to bring in big-name speakers. Investor Cathie Wood, founder of US funds manager ARK Invest, was the most high-profile speaker at this year�s Web3 Festival, although she dialled in remotely for a video chat. She praised Hong Kong�s regulatory efforts and suggested the US is lagging behind.\n\n�We are very impressed with what [Hong Kong] has done in providing a comprehensive regulatory framework for exchanges and institutions from a custody point of view,� Wood said in an onstage interview with HashKey Capital. �This regulatory clarity is critical, we think, to enabling the proliferation of the technology faster perhaps in Hong Kong than in the United States.�\n\nWood encouraged businesses in Hong Kong to take advantage of existing regulatory arbitrage as a �global opportunity�. She also offered an extremely optimistic view of where the price of bitcoin is headed: US$1.5 million by 2030. Its record price was more than US$73,000 on March 13 and currently sits around US$68,000.\n\nThis year�s Web3 Festival started shortly after the conclusion of the WOW Summit and the Liquidity 2024 Institutional Digital Asset Summit, which both dealt with crypto-related topics. Even more events are planned for later this year.\n\nMay will see both Wiki Finance Expo and Bitcoin Asia, and Chainlink will host its SmartCon event in Hong Kong in October. CoinDesk � recently acquired by crypto exchange Bullish, which has strong ties to the city � will bring its major Consensus conference to Hong Kong next year.\n\nStill, the flood of events risks dividing attention, especially with so many other major events taking place in other locations. Token2049 � which holds its flagship event in Singapore and once took place in Hong Kong � is hosting its Dubai conference in two weeks. Paris Blockchain Week is also this week, and ETH Seoul was the last three days of March.\n\nWith other events clustered so closely together, the Web3 Festival was smaller in scale than last year, which happened a few months after Hong Kong announced it�s big crypto push.\n\nThe event this year covers less area in the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, and it has fewer exhibitors, according to HashKey Exchange CEO Livio Weng. However, the event has more sponsorship revenue than last year, and there are more side events, he said.\n\nHong Kong has maintained its commitment to trying to draw the crypto industry to the city after a number of high-profile scandals and collapses in 2022 and 2023. A mandatory licensing scheme that took effect last year was meant to provide regulatory clarity to make the market more attractive. It has drawn 24 applicants so far.\n\nThe city is also moving to regulate stablecoins and over-the-counter cryptocurrency shops. Many are anticipating the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, as well.\n\n�Hong Kong remains the most exciting global opportunity anywhere for a firm wanting to build a virtual assets business or invest in virtual assets,� said Sean Lawrence, head of Asia-Pacific at crypto data provider Kaiko. The city�s advantages include supportive and clear policy directives, a talent pool with experience in traditional finance, and capital to be allocated to virtual assets, he added.\n\nHowever, he noted that entrepreneurs and investors should be �prepared to commit significant time, money and effort�, which are necessary to build consumer-protected, sustainable businesses in Hong Kong.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A mix of mainlanders and international visitors showed up at Bitcoin Asia amid surging interest owing to a crypto bull market and recently launched ETFs.\n\n",
    "content": "The Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong this year drew a strong crowd from mainland China, according to organisers, but it is a different, smaller mix of people than the Bitcoin Conference is used to seeing in the US.\n\nThe conference, held on Thursday and Friday, had about 5,500 attendees confirmed ahead of the show, not accounting for door registrations, said David Bailey, co-founder and CEO of BTC Inc, which runs the Bitcoin Conference and owns Bitcoin Magazine. Without having data at hand, Bailey estimated that about half of the attendees were from mainland China, where interest in the conference was strong owing to Hong Kong�s recent launch of spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and an explosion in development of layer 2 projects.\n\nMany bitcoin enthusiasts also flew in from other countries for the event. Some in the community expressed hope that the city�s supportive policies for the cryptocurrency industry could eventually be an avenue to tapping investors on the mainland, where commercial crypto trading is banned. Several attendees also suggested that they see Hong Kong�s push to become a crypto hub as tacit support from Beijing.\n\n�I think the ETFs were kind of an admission that bitcoin is here to stay,� Bailey said. �There�s no way that Hong Kong just accidentally stumbled into launching an ETF � It wasn�t random.�\n\nCryptocurrency investors also applauded Hong Kong�s new ETFs, as they accept in-kind subscriptions, which allows purchases made with bitcoin and ether. This feature is �very important�, according to Bailey, because crypto investors can use the ETF shares as collaterals for loans. Managers of Hong Kong�s crypto ETFs Harvest Global and ChinaAMC have both said that they are working on pushing ahead with the collateralisation of their ETF products in the city.\n\nThe Hong Kong government, which invited the Bitcoin Conference to hold its Asia event in the city, has been very supportive, according to Bailey. The city has already hosted multiple Web3-related events this year, including the WOW Summit and Web3 Festival, as it seeks to bring in more tourism and crypto industry players.\n\n�I think they see bitcoin as a massive opportunity for Hong Kong,� Bailey said.\n\nBitcoin Asia is much smaller than the US event, which was previously held in Miami, Florida, and this year will be in Nashville, Tennessee. That conference attracts about 30,000 people, Bailey said. This is the first bitcoin-focused conference of its size in Asia in several years.\n\nAlex McShane, director of programming for the Bitcoin Conference, said the turnout in Hong Kong was still much higher than he expected. The company is now looking at options for the event next year. Bailey said the company is already in discussions with Hong Kong for returning to the city, with eyes on the coveted Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai. The event this year was held at the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.\n\nTokyo and Singapore are also options for future Asia events, according to McShane.\n\nSome in the industry are hoping to regain a foothold in China, a market that was once a major centre of bitcoin activity. That evaporated almost overnight in 2021, when mainland authorities pushed out nearly all bitcoin mining activity, although much of that activity has since returned, albeit quietly.\n\nBen Gagnon, chief mining officer at Canada-based Bitfarms who used to run mining operations in China, said he hopes Hong Kong can be a �conduit for Chinese investors� to access bitcoin-related technologies � something he sees as possibly mitigating the impact of the real estate crash and stock market slump.\n\n�What I�m optimistic about is, with these rules and these regulations now in place, Hong Kong actually may find a way to be this bridge for China to bitcoin and to the greater crypto ecosystem in a way that�s more safe, more controlled or regulated,� Gagnon said.\n\n�I hope that there�s going to be more pathways into mainland China,� he added.\n\nBesides the increasing financialisation of bitcoin, the asset�s price surge this year has also driven interest in layer 2 solutions. A layer 2 on a blockchain is a secondary network meant to help with scalability and efficiency, such as by offloading calculations to a secondary chain that is not as congested.\n\nChinese developers were spread across the main floor of Bitcoin Asia touting new companies building their own layer 2 networks.\n\n�There is an explosion of innovation happening in bitcoin right now,� Bailey said. �To go from, let�s call it 200 million bitcoiners in the world to 2 billion people in the world, we need to dramatically improve bitcoin scalability.�\n\nStill, while optimistic about the new opportunities cropping up in the space, he noted some similarities with previous rounds of bitcoin hype.\n\n�Some of these ideas are going to be famous companies a decade from now; some of these are gonna go to zero,� he said. �So it�s still the wild, wild west but � it�s now the wild west on layer 2 of bitcoin.�\n\n",

    "summary": "Crypto industry executives were touting the benefits of bitcoin at the four-day Web3 Festival amid anticipation for the approval of spot ETFs this month.\n\n",
    "content": "Hong Kong�s biggest annual Web3 gathering concluded on Tuesday with industry executives looking to capitalise on the ballooning bitcoin price ahead of what is expected to be the city�s imminent approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the virtual asset this month.\n\nIndustry leaders attending the Hong Kong Web3 Festival shared extremely optimistic projections of the world�s largest cryptocurrency token, the price of which is up 58 per cent to about US$69,000 this year, as the crypto faithful hope to extend the winning streak.\n\nOn the opening day of the event on Saturday, US investor Cathie Wood made the bold prediction that the price of bitcoin was headed to US$1.5 million by 2030. Mao Shixing, co-founder and CEO of crypto custody and wallet provider Cobo, who uses the name Discus Fish in English, said on Tuesday that he thinks even the prediction of a 2,000 per cent increase in the next six years is �conservative�.\n\n\n\nWhile the conference touched on a range of topics, including real-world asset tokenisation and artificial intelligence, �bitcoin and its ecosystem projects� clearly took �centre stage� at the event, said Lily Z. King, chief operating officer of Cobo.\n\nThe excitement also partially stems from active development of so-called layer-2 bitcoin projects, which are networks that run alongside the main blockchain to help it scale through faster transactions. Many crypto firms see this as an opportunity to boost demand for businesses built around bitcoin.\n\nSpot ETFs are driving the most excitement, though, as it will give investors an easy way to expose themselves to bitcoin without needing to worry about managing cryptocurrency keys and storage.\n\nMultiple people attending the event said they expect the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to approve spot bitcoin ETFs this month, following the approval of such funds in the US in January. Tencent News reported that the first batch could be announced as soon as April 15, with mainland Chinese fund managers Harvest International and China Asset Management Company (ChinaAMC) to be among the issuers.\n\nThe SFC recently approved Harvest and ChinaAMC to manage portfolios that invest more than 10 per cent in virtual assets, according to the regulator�s website.\n\nHong Kong regulators said in December that the city is prepared to allow retail access to ETFs that invest directly into cryptocurrencies and will start to authorise funds that offer such products.\n\nApart from traditional investors, Hong Kong�s bitcoin spot ETFs will be attractive to �crypto native players� because Hong Kong�s regime is currently the only one in the world that allows in-kind subscriptions, said Marco Lim, managing partner at Hong Kong-based crypto hedge fund MaiCapital.\n\nUnder such arrangements, participating dealers can directly use bitcoin to subscribe to or redeem spot ETF shares, whereas in the US, these products can only be redeemed with dollars.\n\nThe introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs will be a �monumental stride� not only for the local market, but for the global perception of digital assets, said Cobo�s King. It represents a �significant leap� towards recognising cryptocurrencies as legitimate alternative assets and will pave the way for widespread adoption, she added.\n\nExcitement is not just limited to bitcoin, though. Some at the Web3 Festival talked of the potential approval of spot ETFs for ether, the native token on the Ethereum blockchain. That is the other cryptocurrency that licensed exchanges can currently offer in Hong Kong.\n\nThat would make Hong Kong a first mover in the space, but it could be a harder sell for regulators. Some bitcoin ETF issuers in the US told CNBC this week that they expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject ether ETF applications.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Blockchain made up about 15 per cent of the talks at Money20/20 Asia this year, just slightly below the proportion of talks on AI, as interest remains high in Asia.\n\n",
    "content": "Blockchain technologies emerged as an important trend at an Asia fintech conference this week, along with artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nOut of the 139 talks and panels at the first Money20/20 in Bangkok � and the first in Asia since a show in Singapore in 2019 � 22 were directly related to blockchain, digital assets and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), according to the event organisers. AI was still the most talked about tech topic, with 25 sessions in the fintech category directly addressing it.\n\nAsia�s strong interest in blockchain technologies marks a contrast to the US, where Money20/20 holds its flagship conference in Las Vegas. The Securities and Exchange Commission�s moves have dampened enthusiasm for Web3 in the world�s largest economy, conference attendees say, and focus has shifted largely to AI, an area in which the US has a leading position.\n\n\n\nIn Asia, �there�s still more of a focus on Web3, metaverse�, said Danny Levy, managing director of Money20/20 Asia. �We don�t see that at the other events. It�s not really a focus at all.�\n\nDaranee Saeju, assistant governor of the Payment Systems Policy and Financial Consumer Protection Group at the Bank of Thailand, discussed the potential transformative effects of blockchain for developing economies.\n\n�Imagine a world where payments are frictionless, borders are invisible, and money can move very fast, very cheap, convenient, secure and transparent,� Saeju said. �That�s the future we are researching here in Thailand.�\n\nShe mentioned Thailand�s participation in the mBridge project with mainland China, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates for trialling the sending of CBDC payments across borders using blockchain.\n\nJPMorgan announced at the show a partnership with Kasikornbank, one of Thailand�s largest banks, to launch Project Carina, which will allow for fast cross-border payments. The system works by transferring Q-money tied to the Thai Baht on Kasikornbank�s Quarix blockchain to JPMorgan�s JPM Coin on that bank�s Onyx blockchain. The goal is to reduce average transaction times from 72 hours to five minutes, the companies said.\n\n�Spending a lot of time with senior banking execs globally, blockchain is still a conversation now,� said Scarlett Sieber, chief strategy and growth officer at Money 20/20. The JPMorgan announcement comes after a decade of banks talking about working together on blockchain tech, she added.\n\nStablecoins were another big topic of conversation at the show, as companies prepare for coming regulations that could further legitimise the use of cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currency like the US dollar (USD).\n\nRipple, which had a booth at the show, announced this month that it is launching its own USD-pegged stablecoin on both the XRP Ledger blockchain, created by the company, and Ethereum. �It�s about providing the option for another settlement currency easily through our network,� said Fiona Murray, managing director of Asia-Pacific (APAC) at Ripple.\n\nAs companies explore the opportunities in Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia, though, many of the opportunities for infrastructure and business-to-business companies like Ripple are in mature financial markets. Ripple�s biggest markets in APAC are Singapore, where it has its regional headquarters, Hong Kong and Australia, Murray said.\n\nAttendees from Hong Kong were also searching for what opportunities in Southeast Asia mean for the city that has been making a big push to become a Web3 and cryptocurrency hub.\n\n�You heard Bank of Thailand�s aspirations. That�s a lot,� Angelina Kwan, a Hong Kong-based senior adviser to IMC Asia-Pacific, said during a panel discussion about decentralised finance. �We should be worried in Singapore and Hong Kong, because Thailand wants to be a real leader in this area.�\n\nThe latest stage of Hong Kong�s push to formalise rules for the cryptocurrency industry involve a planned stablecoin regulation from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority that will require a licence to issue those products. RD Technologies, which exhibited at the conference, is one of the companies that has been planning to launch a stablecoin pegged to the Hong Kong dollar.\n\nBeyond talk around blockchain and AI � which dealt with topics like fraud prevention and regulatory compliance � it was clear that less buzzy and more familiar technologies remain at the centre of the fintech business.\n\nA major theme of the show was financial inclusion. While some speakers touted the benefits of blockchain as a way of reaching and serving unbanked and underbanked populations � a big topic in Southeast Asia � others focused on more staid solutions.\n\nWeLab, which operates the virtual WeLab Bank in Hong Kong and recently started a new joint venture in Indonesia called Bank Saqu, has been looking at opportunities in Southeast Asia for expanding credit. �In Indonesia, the access to credit continues to be one of the biggest challenges,� said Jessica Lam, chief strategy officer at WeLab.\n\n\n\nWeLab, which also operates in mainland China, has sought for its online banks to be more nimble and agile than larger financial institutions, but it is still offering more traditional financial solutions than are typically found in discussions wrapped up in blockchain hype.\n\n�Buzzwords aside, I think it�s about relevance so far,� Lam said. �Is there a meaningful advantage that some of these new technologies and techniques bring? If so, we will incorporate them into our business.�\n\nMoney20/20 Asia returned for the first time in five years, but it switched locations. After cancelling its last Singapore show planned in 2020 because of Covid-19, it has now signed a three-year deal with Thailand to host the regional show in Bangkok.\n\nAttendance surpassed 3,000 people this year, the organisers said, in line with expectations and the 3,100 that attended the 2019 event in Singapore. The last events in Amsterdam and Las Vegas had more than two and three times the number of attendees, respectively, according to the organisers.\n\n",

    "content": "Hong Kong has approved preparations for the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETF) that invest directly in bitcoin and ether, the world�s two largest cryptocurrency tokens, as the city looks to secure a leading position in the volatile virtual asset sector.\n\nMainland Chinese fund house Bosera Asset Management�s overseas arm and Hong Kong virtual asset firm HashKey Capital received �conditional approval� from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to jointly launch spot crypto ETFs, the companies said in announcements published online on Monday.\n\nChinese fund managers Harvest International and China Asset Management Company (ChinaAMC) are also among those to receive a green light, according to Chinese media outlet Caixin. ChinaAMC announced that it was working on those ETF products after receiving SFC approval to provide virtual asset management services.\n\n\n\nThe SFC, which first published rules for allowing spot crypto ETFs in December, was widely expected to approve spot bitcoin ETFs this week. The inclusion of spot ether ETFs makes it the first market in Asia, and the first global finance hub, to approve such a product. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January approved spot bitcoin ETFs, but it has delayed a decision on similar ether products.\n\nThe SFC has not made any announcement on the ETFs, as none have been officially approved yet. The conditional approval allows applicants to move forward with preparations to offer the funds, such as applying to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) to offer them on the local stock exchange.\n\n�The SFC issues a conditional authorisation letter to an ETF application if it generally satisfies our requirements, subject to various conditions, including fee payments, filing of documents and HKEX�s listing approval,� the SFC said in a statement to the Post, without clarifying the status of any spot crypto ETF applications.\n\nSpot crypto ETFs are considered a boon for investors who want exposure to such assets without needing to worry about setting up their own blockchain wallets or other technical details that can be a hurdle. ETFs can also be included in things like retirement funds, making them more appealing to mainstream investors.\n\nSince the US started allowing spot bitcoin ETFs this year, they have seen more than US$200 billion in trading volume, according to crypto news and data outlet The Block.\n\nBitcoin�s price has been surging since late last year, and especially after the US ETF approval in January. However, the price has fallen about 8 per cent in the past week to around US$66,700. After approving the spot ETF, SEC Chair Gary Gensler warned that bitcoin remains a �speculative, volatile asset�.\n\nThe SEC has repeatedly delayed making a decision on ETFs that directly invest in ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. It is expected to conclude its review in late May.\n\nThat makes the approval in Hong Kong, which normally trails the US in approving such financial instruments, look more ambitious as the city seeks to transform itself into a virtual asset hub.\n\nWhile the Hong Kong market is relatively small, industry insiders say local spot crypto ETFs could be globally competitive because they allow for both cash and in-kind subscriptions � i.e. converting bitcoin or ether into their ETF equivalents. In the US, the products can only be purchased with dollars.\n\nThe in-kind arrangement offers benefits such as lower transactional costs and higher operational efficiencies, said Andrew Fei, a partner at King \u0026 Wood Mallesons in Hong Kong.\n\n�The approvals of the first spot bitcoin and spot ether ETFs in Asia mark an important milestone in Hong Kong�s bid to become a global digital assets hub,� Fei said. �The strong crypto investor base in Asia, combined with the in-kind redemption feature and support for HK dollar trading, give these Hong Kong ETFs a real competitive edge.�\n\nAdditional reporting by Matt Haldane.\n\n",

    "summary": "Hong Kong�s biggest licensed cryptocurrency exchange operator has launched a global trading platform, but it is not available in the US or China.\n\n",
    "content": "Hong Kong�s biggest licensed cryptocurrency exchange operator, HashKey Group, has launched a new global trading platform that it hopes will help the company overtake US-based crypto giant Coinbase in trading volume within five years.\n\nThe new cryptocurrency exchange, HashKey Global, operates with a Digital Asset Business licence issued in Bermuda. It is now available globally with one big caveat: for regulatory reasons, certain markets like the US, mainland China and Hong Kong cannot use it, HashKey Group chief operating officer (COO) Livio Weng said in an interview on Saturday on the sidelines of the Hong Kong Web3 Festival, a crypto conference organised by the company.\n\nThe company, established in Hong Kong in 2018, operates the local HashKey Exchange, which was approved by the city�s securities regulator last August to serve retail investors under the city�s new crypto regulatory regime. The exchange can so far only offer bitcoin and ether for retail trading.\n\n\n\nHashKey Exchange now has more than 170,000 registered users, Weng said on Saturday. It hosted about US$35 million in 24-hour trading volume on Monday, according to market tracker CoinGecko, which ranks the platform 15th according to a trust score that tries to measure legitimacy of trading data. However, HashKey�s volume is still a trickle compared with some of the world�s largest exchanges.\n\nBinance had US$6.3 billion in 24-hour normalised trading volume by mid-day on Monday, while OKX recorded more than US$2.1 billion, CoinGecko shows.\n\nHashKey is hoping that a new global exchange will supercharge its market position. Weng said the company intends to have more trading volume than Coinbase, the largest US crypto exchange, across all HashKey Group platforms by 2029.\n\n�We have seen their data and we don�t think that�ll be difficult,� Weng said.\n\nThe global exchange could be particularly appealing to overseas Chinese and investors across Asian markets that do not block offshore crypto exchanges, according to the COO.\n\nFacing intense competition from existing crypto exchanges around the world, HashKey Global has an advantage as a compliant platform that also offers a smooth experience, Weng said.\n\nMost of the world�s major exchanges are either �easy to use but not compliant�, or �compliant but hard to use�, he said.\n\nHashKey Group � whose businesses include the investment firm HashKey Capital and an asset-management arm � is among a range of cryptocurrency companies banking on Hong Kong�s embrace of the virtual asset industry.\n\nWhile public perception of the sector took a plunge last year following high-profile scandals � including the collapse of FTX in late 2022 and a local fraud involving the lesser known JPEX exchange a year later � confidence has rebounded in recent months after a surge in bitcoin prices in the new year. It hit a new record of more than US$73,000 last month.\n\nApart from a mandatory licensing regime for crypto exchanges, Hong Kong is also moving to regulate stablecoins and over-the-counter cryptocurrency shops. Many are also anticipating an imminent approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the city.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "HashKey will facilitate the sale and purchase of Toncoin, the native token of the TON blockchain, which was started by Telegram Messenger.\n\n",
    "content": "HashKey Group, operator of one of only two licensed cryptocurrency exchanges in Hong Kong, is teaming up with the operator of the blockchain created by Telegram Messenger to give users an on- and off-ramp by exchanging their so-called Toncoins for cash.\n\nThe agreement applies to users in the Asia-Pacific region and will see the two organizations work on �new ecosystem projects by providing mentorship, networking opportunities, and other incubation activities�, TON Foundation said in an announcement on Friday.\n\nThe foundation governing TON � an acronym that once stood for Telegram Open Network and now means simply The Open Network � was set up after Telegram was forced to abandon the blockchain because of a settlement with the US Securities and Futures Commission in 2020. The separate organisation has continued to develop the blockchain and later integrated it into Telegram through a mini app and business arrangements.\n\n�This is potentially quite massive,� TON Foundation president Steve Yun said. He referenced HashKey�s regulatory compliance as a way to help with know-your-customer (KYC) rules. �We do take strategic steps to make sure we follow the compliance requirements.�\n\n\n\nEven as TON has sought to keep itself separate from Telegram, the main utility of its blockchain remains tied to the popular messaging app, which has more than 900 million users globally, according to Yun. While anyone can build mini apps integrating other public blockchains into Telegram, the TON Foundation pays for premium real estate in the app, making it the default wallet option in the sidebar.\n\nHowever, TON is still grappling with regulatory issues. To avoid complications, it bars people in certain jurisdictions such as the US, China and Hong Kong from using the cryptocurrency function within Telegram.\n\nTelegram is blocked in mainland China, but the app became popular in Hong Kong during the 2019 anti-government protests. It has also become the messenger of choice for crypto enthusiasts. Despite its security issues compared with WhatsApp and Signal, features like broadcast channels and trading bots are popular in the community.\n\nTON is betting on the mini app ecosystem on Telegram as a means of driving adoption of its blockchain, which Yun said can scale better than most blockchains because of its use of sharding � a means of breaking up a blockchain into different segments.\n\nGreater adoption means more users will be looking for ways to convert their tokens to cash and vice versa. TON also sees Asia as a natural fit because they are already used to the �super app� concept, according to Yun, hence the team-up with HashKey in the region.\n\n�Where in the world do [people] know how to build mini apps as part of a super app? Not many places,� Yun said. �Eastern Europe because VK is popular. [Asia-Pacific] because of Line, Kakao and WeChat.�\n\nThe agreement also adds to HashKey�s recent expansion efforts. The Hong Kong-based company became the second licensed crypto exchange operator in the city in 2022, nearly two years after BC Technology Group, which operates the OSL exchange.\n\nDuring the Web3 Festival, which HashKey organised, the company on Monday launched a global crypto exchange. TON was also a major sponsor of the festival, where it held several talks and events.\n\nOn Thursday, Hong Kong�s Securities and Futures Commission upgraded HashKey�s licence to allow the company to sell crypto-related investment products to retail investors. It has already been selling bitcoin and ether on its retail-facing platform that it launched in November.\n\nThe local crypto firm known today mostly just in Hong Kong has been looking to transform itself into a major international player. Livio Weng, the chief operating officer, said this week that HashKey intends to surpass Coinbase in trading volume by 2030. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, currently has around 30 times the 24-hour trading volume of HashKey.\n\nTeaming with TON foundation offers it a different avenue to scale than Coinbase, which has seen its fortunes rise with the popularity of bitcoin since its founding 12 years ago. HashKey is just half that age.\n\nIf Toncoin becomes popular through its integration with Telegram and its myriad mini apps, as the TON Foundation is betting on, then HashKey could suddenly find itself with millions of potential new users across Asia as it facilitates the default medium of exchange on one of the world�s most popular messenger apps.\n\n",

All three ether ETFs closed down less than 1 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe bitcoin ETFs saw nearly HK$67 million (US$9.2 million) in trading volume by the end of the day, with ChinaAMC�s ETF seeing the most trading with about HK$37 million changing hands.\n\nHong Kong�s launch of new crypto ETFs, seen as offering some advantages for investors in Asia compared with similar products in the US that are much bigger in scale, will test the city�s progress in its pursuit of becoming a hub for virtual asset businesses.\n\nThe six Hong Kong funds racked up nearly HK$87 million by the close of trading. In comparison, 11 bitcoin ETFs in the US, which debuted in January, saw more than US$4.6 billion traded on their first day.\n\nHong Kong could expect the trading volume of its spot crypto ETFs to reach 20 per cent of those in the US within about a year, HashKey Group chief operating officer Livio Weng said at a briefing on Tuesday.\n\nMarket makers likely contributed the bulk of first-day trading, so it remains to be seen how demand for these products will hold up in the coming days and weeks.\n\nFund managers and brokerages are dangling favourable policies to draw investors, with Harvest waiving its management fee for six months and Bosera for four months. Online Chinese brokerage Tiger Brokers said in a statement on Monday that it is offering platform fee exemptions for the first batch of these ETFs.\n\nGiven the Hong Kong ETF market�s diminutive size compared with the US, the funds are hoping to draw investors looking for products offered specifically in Asia.\n\nNon-Hong Kong residents can purchase shares in the crypto ETFs as long as they pass local know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, HashKey Capital said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nWhile that means the ETFs are technically available to mainland Chinese investors who have Hong Kong bank or brokerage accounts, investing in these products could still be difficult because mainland identity cards may not be able to pass brokerage platforms� KYC procedures, said one industry insider who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nBeijing has strictly banned commercial cryptocurrency trading on the mainland. Other types of ETFs can already be traded through the Stock Connect scheme that links to markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\nHong Kong regulators at the launch event on Tuesday morning, which included a bell-ringing ceremony, cautioned that there are high risks involved in the crypto-based products despite the successful listings.\n\n�Our approval for virtual asset ETFs does not equate to us supporting the relevant virtual assets or us encouraging the public to invest in them,� Christina Choi Fung Yee, executive director of investment products at the Securities and Futures Commission, said during the ceremony. �Virtual assets are extremely speculative with highly volatile prices � I�d like to remind everyone that virtual assets are not suitable for all investors.�\n\n",

    "summary": "Bitcoin halving, a once-every-four year event baked into the system, will slash the reward that is the main revenue stream for miners.\n\n",
    "content": "About 6,000 older bitcoin mining machines in the US will soon be idled and sent to a warehouse in Colorado Springs, where they will be refreshed and resold to buyers overseas looking to profit from mining in lower-cost environments.\n\nWholesaler SunnySide Digital operates the 35,000-square-foot facility taking in the equipment from a mining client. The outdated machines are among several hundred-thousand it expects to receive and refurbish around a major quadrennial update in the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nKnown as the halving, the late April event will slash the reward that is the main revenue stream for miners, who will try to lessen the impact by upgrading to the latest and most efficient technology.\n\nWith electricity the biggest expense, mining companies including publicly traded giants Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Platforms need to lower usage costs to maintain a positive margin. Their older computers may still bring a profit, just not likely in the US.\n\n�It�s a natural migration� with buyers of the old machines operating in parts of the world where power is the cheapest, said SunnySide Digital chief executive officer Taras Kulyk, who has resold US computers to miners in countries such as Ethiopia, Tanzania, Paraguay and Uruguay. �This is accelerated by the halving.�\n\nSome 600,000 S19 series computers, which account for a majority of machines currently in use, are moving out of the US mostly to Africa and South America, according to an estimate by Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at crypto-mining services and logistics provider Luxor Technology in Seattle.\n\nIn bitcoin mining, specialised machines are used to validate transactions on the blockchain and earn operators a fixed token reward.\n\nAnonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto baked in the once-every-four-years halving to maintain the hard cap of 21 million tokens. Next month�s event is the fourth since 2012 and the reward will drop to 3.125 bitcoin from 6.25 now.\n\nBitcoin has surged about 50 per cent this year to around US$63,500, though it is down from a record high of US$73,798 reached on March 14.\n\nBringing more efficient machines online has become more urgent with the halving just weeks away, as continued use of older equipment could mean electricity costs will be close to or exceed mining revenue.\n\nWhile S19 series and similar models might not be profitable to run in the US after the halving, they �can still generate decent profits and get an extended life if hosted� in parts of Africa, said Jaran Mellerud, CEO at Dubai-based Hashlabs Mining, which leases data centre space in Ethiopia and provides hosting services to bitcoin miners.\n\nSome buyers are waiting until after the event to purchase older computers, assuming their prices will drop even more, said Lauren Lin, Luxor�s business development director.\n\nThe used S19 models cost about US$7,030 in March 2022, according to Luxor, which runs a trading desk for used machines. The price dropped dramatically a year later to about US$900 as bitcoin prices sank, then to about US$427 this month and is estimated to sell for about US$356 in May, after the halving.\n\nThere are miners in the US opting not to sell their hardware and instead transfer the equipment to regions with lower electricity costs and third-party data centres. Nuo Xu, who has two sites in Texas, is travelling this month to Ethiopia, Nigeria and a few other countries to scope out locations for about 6,000 older computers.\n\n�There are more risks for my machines in Africa but I have to move them there,� he said. �Cheaper electricity outside the US means it will take a much shorter time to recover the overhead costs,� with labour and building materials also much less expensive, he said.\n\nMiners globally who do not have their own facilities pay a hosting fee, which typically includes electricity, labour and third-party operators.\n\nIt has been Xu�s experience that fees in the US come to about 7 US cents per kilowatt hour. In Ethiopia, which has loosened regulations on crypto mining and increased its power generation, the rate is about 5 US cents, according to Hashlab�s Mellerud. That two-cent difference is huge for miners.\n\nElectricity itself is about 3 US cents per kWh in Ethiopia, according to Hiwot Eshetu, marketing and business development director at Ethiopian Electric Power. In the US, the range is about 3 US cents to 6 US cents, based on estimates from Luxor.\n\n�Ethiopia is really becoming a big player in the digital mining ecosystem,� said SunnySide�s Kulyk, who added his company is negotiating a deal to help move between 20,000 and 40,000 rigs to the east African nation.\n\n\n\nNot all US-based equipment leaves the country. That process can be tougher for publicly traded companies because they have to take risk-averse shareholders into account. There is also some hesitation to relocate machines abroad due to transport costs, breakage and security concerns.\n\nPublicly traded Bit Digital, one of the biggest bitcoin miners, has older generations of computers sitting dormant in a warehouse in Houston.\n\n�These machines basically collect dust every now and again,� said CEO Sam Tabar. But the New York-based company holds onto them because when bitcoin prices are high, the computers can be pulled out of retirement and still make a profit, he said.\n\nMiners have been prepping for the halving for years and are spending big bucks to replace their older hardware.\n\nThe 13 major public bitcoin-mining companies, including Riot Platforms and CleanSpark, have placed orders for more than US$1 billion worth of machines since February 2023, according to crypto-mining researcher TheMinerMag.\n\nFive of the biggest miners raised more than US$2.7 billion from selling shares in the two years ended in December. Since the start of this year, those same miners have raked in an additional US$840 million, according to the researcher.\n\n",

    "content": "Crypto analyst TechDev has provided insights into the Bitcoin (BTC) future trajectory. The analyst hinted that the flagship crypto was currently mirroring its price action in 2017 and could soon make a parabolic rise like it did back then. History Could Repeat Itself TechDev shared a chart on his X (formerly Twitter) platform with the caption, �The more things change, the more they stay the same.� The chart showed that Bitcoin�s current price action was mirroring that of the 2017 bull run when it recorded a price gain of 1,200% on its way to a previous high of $20,000. Related Reading This Crypto Trader Just Sold All His Bitcoin For Altcoins Like Cardano And XRP, Here�s Why 4 days ago Source: X Interestingly, just like in 2017, when Bitcoin�s price bottomed following the Bitfinex crash, the crypto token also looked to have bottomed in this market cycle when FTX, another crypto exchange, collapsed. Back then, Bitcoin consolidated for some time before enjoying a parabolic rally, which made it reach $20,000 in 2018. As TechDev suggested, history could repeat itself with Bitcoin consolidating ahead of a move that could send it to as high as $100,000. From the chart the crypto analyst shared, one could see that Bitcoin has consolidated longer in this market cycle than it did in 2017. However, crypto analyst Rekt Capital hinted that this longer period of consolidation was necessary. He mentioned that Bitcoin was accelerating by almost 200 days in this market cycle and added that consolidating for longer will help it resynchronize with previous bull cycles. This strategic consolidation is a reassuring sign of Bitcoin�s stability and potential for growth. Meanwhile, in a recent X post, he revealed that Bitcoin was already attempting to perform the �post Bull Flag breakout retest,� which could secure a trend continuation to the upside. Source: X In a subsequent X post, Rekt Capital shared a chart showing that a breakout from the $66,000 range could kickstart the continuation of Bitcoin�s bull run, which could well send its price above $100,000. �Optimal Targets� For Bitcoin In This Market Cycle Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto mentioned in an X post that the optimal targets for Bitcoin in this bull run should be between $138,000 and $150,000. Interestingly, he made this statement while revealing that the crypto�s current price action is mirroring that of 2017. The crypto analyst�s prediction suggests that Bitcoin enjoying a 1,200% price gain (like in 2017) is unlikely. Related Reading Cardano Whales Return To The Table, Increase Massive Holdings By 10% 4 days ago However, it is worth noting that other crypto analysts like PlanB have offered more bullish predictions for Bitcoin, which indicates that the flagship crypto could still see a 10x increase from its current price level. Specifically, PlanB predicted that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $1 million in 2025, which would be the market top for the crypto token. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,000, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator Suggests BTC Rally Only Halfway Done In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has posted an update for how the Bitcoin Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator is looking like after the latest rally. The VWAP is an indicator that, as its full form suggests, calculates an average price for the cryptocurrency based on not just the changes in the price over the day but also the volume that was traded at these prices. Related Reading Litecoin Whales Go On $230 Million Buying Spree: Will This Change LTC�s Stars? 2 days ago Normally, this volume is measured using the spot volume data provided by centralized exchanges. Still, in the case of Bitcoin, the blockchain is available for anyone to explore, so on-chain volume is used to calculate the VWAP instead. The VWAP Oscillator, which is the actual metric of interest here, takes the ratio between the cryptocurrency�s spot price and the VWAP and represents it as an oscillator around zero. Earlier in the month, Woo had pointed out how the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator was forming a bullish divergence for the asset. How the VWAP Oscillator looked like earlier in the month | Source: @woonomic on X As is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator climbed up inside the negative territory after forming an apparent bottom back then. At the same time, the cryptocurrency�s price had been heading down instead. In the past, such a setup has proven to be bullish for the coin, and the resulting bullish momentum usually lasts until the VWAP Oscillator tops out in positive territory. As such, the analyst remarked that the coin had a lot of room to run back then. Since then, the price has experienced a recovery rally, potentially suggesting that the bullish divergence may be paying off. As Woo pointed out, the indicator has returned to the neutral mark after this run. It looks like the value of the metric is making a break into the positive territory | Source: @woonomic on X Based on the fact that tops in the past have occurred after the metric peaks in the positive territory and based on the scale of these peaks usually, the analyst concludes, �this Bitcoin move is now at the halfway mark.� Related Reading Bulls In Control: Ethereum Longs See Biggest Candle Ever After ETF News 2 days ago As for how things could play out next, the analyst says, Consolidation under all-time-high needs to happen for a little, then we see if the second leg gives us escape velocity to new highs which will open up the flood gates. Woo has also shared a �risk signal� for Bitcoin, which shows where the asset is when looking at the bigger picture. The data for the BTC risk signal over the last few years | Source: @woonomic on X BTC may be in that part of the cycle where risk begins to drive up as price reacts violently to capital inflows. �That�s where most of the fast gains happen,� notes the analyst.

The most bullish area is the meme coin sector, which continues to grow and expand, offering the best opportunity to earn profits during the anticipated bull run. As the crypto community prepares for it and looks for attractive investment opportunities, numerous industry experts are pointing towards these five tokens, believing they could explode in the weeks ahead. Let�s take a closer look at these hidden altcoin gems. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet the Best Presale Coin Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Best Five Tokens for Profitable Investments in 2024 � Quick Outline Here�s a quick outline of the tokens we�ll be analyzing: Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) � Pioneering Multi-Chain Token Surpasses $15M Milestone in Just Over a Month Sealana ($SEAL) � Set to Transform the Traditional American Dream Right from Its Mother�s Basement WienerAI ($WAI) � Draws Significant Attention by Combining AI and Meme Coin Culture and Offering Major APYs Sponge V2 ($SPONGE) � Boosts Investment Potential with New Features Including an Engaging Play-to-Earn Game Bonk (BONK) � Leading Solana Token Gaining Traction Before the Bull Run \u003e\u003e\u003eGet the Best Presale Coin Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Best Five Tokens for Profitable Investments in 2024 � Detailed Analysis Now, let�s examine each one to discover what makes them stand out in the market. Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) � Pioneering Multi-Chain Token Surpasses $15M Milestone in Just Over a Month Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), an innovative meme coin, operates on a multi-chain framework that includes Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Solana, Base, and Avalanche. This architecture improves efficiency, reduces transaction fees, and greatly improves the user experience. The Dogeverse presale has garnered significant attention, raising over $15 million from early investors in just over a month. There are still opportunities to invest, with 15% of the tokens designated for the presale, 10% reserved for staking rewards, and 25% allocated for future projects. Following the presale, 5% of the tokens will be used for exchange listings, with 10% each allocated for liquidity and operational support. Dogeverse plans to list on major platforms such as CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap and offers staking options with APYs around 53%. Currently, $DOGEVERSE tokens are priced at $0.0003 each, but this rate is anticipated to soar right after the listing. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Dogeverse Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sealana ($SEAL) � Set to Transform the Traditional American Dream Right from Its Mother�s Basement Sealana ($SEAL) is a Solana-based meme coin featuring a seal character similar to the Gamer Guy from �South Park.� The presale has quickly gained traction, collecting over $2.2 million despite minimal social media presence, reflecting strong investor confidence in $SEAL. Investors can buy Sealana through a widget on the project�s website or by sending SOL to a designated wallet, enabling direct participation in the presale and the potential for profits post-listing. During the presale, contributors receive 6,900 $SEAL tokens per SOL, following a model similar to Slothana, which raised $15 million in a short time. With the hype around it growing, the crypto community is watching $SEAL closely, anticipating it will outperform the success of previous projects on the Solana blockchain. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sealana Now\u003c\u003c\u003c WienerAI ($WAI) � Draws Significant Attention by Combining AI and Meme Coin Culture and Offering Major APYs WienerAI ($WAI) is an innovative AI-driven meme coin, created as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. This unique mix of AI technology and memes appeals to investors by securing transaction precision and security. WienerAI aims to reduce the usual fluctuations of meme coins by offering a staking mechanism with an APY of approximately 400%, promoting long-term holding and massive rewards. To date, over 2.6 billion tokens have been staked. Currently priced at $0.0007, the presale has already raised over $2.5 million. Of the total 69 billion tokens, 30% are allocated for the presale, 20% for staking and community rewards, and 30% for future exchange listings and marketing efforts. As the presale progresses, investors are suggested to participate early to benefit from the favorable price and high APYs. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy WienerAI Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sponge V2 ($SPONGE) � Boosts Investment Potential with New Features Including an Engaging Play-to-Earn Game SPONGE V2 ($SPONGE) is the latest upgrade of the popular $SPONGE meme crypto token, which previously achieved a $100 million market cap and provided significant returns to early investors. A notable enhancement in $SPONGE V2 is a Play-to-Earn game inspired by SpongeBob SquarePants. Given the impressive growth of the original $SPONGE token, investors are optimistic about the potential success of Sponge V2 in the meme coin market. To promote long-term investment, the project features a scheme where holders who lock their original Sponge V1 tokens for an extended period can earn impressive staking rewards in $SPONGE V2 tokens over four years. This strategy is designed to boost early adoption and maintain engagement. As the presale nears its conclusion, investors are suggested to secure the remaining tokens before the listing. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sponge V2 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Bonk (BONK) � Leading Solana Token Gaining Traction Before the Bull Run Bonk (BONK) was introduced on the Solana network on Christmas 2023, inspired by the Shiba Inu dog. Leveraging the Solana blockchain, Bonk provides faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to Ethereum, which hosts many other meme coins. Although currently a meme coin, there are rumors that Bonk might venture into the DeFi and NFT sectors in the future, indicating potential growth beyond its present status. With a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens, Bonk�s scarcity could potentially impact its price dynamics. Over the past month, BONK has surged by 55.5%, and over the year, it has seen an astonishing increase of 7743%, making it a noteworthy investment opportunity. Given the ongoing growth and appeal of the Solana ecosystem, Bonk could stand out in the anticipated bull run, attracting investors globally. Final Thoughts As the wider crypto market has experienced a surge in recent weeks, it�s obvious that the meme coins sector leads the way. Now, with the anticipated bull run on the horizon, investors are on the lookout for the next exploding tokens to add to their portfolios. Many industry experts suggest these five tokens, believing they could outperform major players in profits in the following weeks. The great news is, you can still acquire them at affordable prices since most of them are still in the ICO stage.\n\n",

    "content": "An analyst has explained how profit-taking looks to have finished for Bitcoin in what has been a �very healthy reset� for the market. Bitcoin SOPR Suggests Profit-Taking From Investors Has Cooled Off In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed about the latest trend occurring in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). The SOPR is an on-chain indicator that basically tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling their coins at a profit or loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the average holder in the sector could be assumed to be moving coins at some net profit currently. On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies loss realization is the dominant mode of selling in the market. Related Reading Chainlink Becomes Crypto Winner With 21% Rally: What�s Driving This? 5 days ago Naturally, the SOPR being exactly equal to 1 suggests the total profits being realized are exactly equal to the losses at the moment and thus, the investors are just breaking-even on their selling. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been neutral in recent days | Source: @woonomic on X As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOPR had spiked to highly positive levels earlier when the cryptocurrency�s price had observed its rally towards a new all-time high (ATH). This would suggest that the investors had been participating in some aggressive profit-taking during this run. From the chart, it�s visible that such a trend was also observed around the start of the 2021 bull run. With the consolidation, the asset has gone through since the ATH, the indicator�s value has also seen a cooldown. As Woo has highlighted in the chart, the metric has now approached the neutral mark. It would appear that two months after the profit-taking peaked, the appetite for harvesting gains has potentially finally disappeared among the investors. The analyst says this is a very healthy reset for the cryptocurrency, especially as the capital inflows have once again been picking up for the coin. Looks like the indicator has gone through a turnaround recently | Source: @woonomic From the chart, it�s apparent that the Bitcoin network flows had been following an overall downward trajectory earlier when the consolidation was taking place, but recently, capital injections into the coin have once again been on the rise. Related Reading Bitcoin Still Has �A Lot Of Room To Run Before Reversal,� Says Top Analyst 6 days ago This is a similar trend to what was observed earlier in the year during the crash following the approval of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The turnabout in capital inflows back then was what led into the rally that took the cryptocurrency to the current ATH. BTC Price Bitcoin had seen a pullback under $66,000 yesterday, raising worries that the recovery surge had already fizzled out. This drop only lasted briefly, though, as the coin has returned above $67,000 today.

Related Reading Tiny Pepe, Big Dreams: Memecoin Explodes, Eyes Dominance In The Dog House 6 hours ago Market Insights And Price Forecasts For Bitcoin As the crypto community eagerly anticipates the future of Bitcoin, a diverse range of price predictions has emerged. Notable figures such as Arthur Hayes, Messari, Tim Draper, JP Morgan, Berenberg, and VanEck have weighed in with their forecasts, painting a varied picture of what lies ahead for the pioneering cryptocurrency. While some experts project conservative estimates, suggesting a price range of around $45,000, others are more bullish, envisioning BTC soaring to over $600,000 by 2024. These forecasts are underpinned by a nuanced understanding of market dynamics, including factors such as institutional interest, regulatory developments, and the impact of halving events on Bitcoin�s supply and demand dynamics. Bitcoin is now trading at $69,924. Chart: TradingView Historical Analysis And Market Cycle Patterns Drawing insights from historical data and market cycle patterns, analysts have identified intriguing parallels that could signal significant upside potential for Bitcoin. Previous market cycles have shown that after surpassing key all-time highs, Bitcoin prices have the propensity to double within a relatively short timeframe. The analysis of past cycles, particularly the peaks in 2013, 2017, and 2021, suggests a pattern of rapid price appreciation following the breach of previous price records. If history is any indication, Bitcoin could be poised for a substantial move upwards, with projections indicating a potential doubling in price to around $140,000 in the near future. Expert Opinions And Market Sentiment Amidst the flurry of price predictions and market analyses, experts and analysts continue to offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency markets. Notable figures such as Alphanalysis and Will Woo have shared their perspectives on Bitcoin�s price trajectory, highlighting the importance of market corrections, accumulation phases, and the gradual build-up towards new all-time highs. In 2017 the price of Bitcoin doubled in just 4 weeks after it established brand new all time highs. In 2021 the price of Bitcoin doubled in just 4 weeks after it established brand new all time highs.

XRP Price Roadmap to $20 In an X (formerly Twitter) post on May 20, Crypto analyst, Javon Marks forecasted a strong bullish breakout for the XRP price in this market cycle. Marks explained that XRP was steadily approaching a critical converging point, with an emerging Relative Strength Index (RSI) pattern indicating strong underlying momentum for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading Institutional Investors Pour $942 Million Into Bitcoin, Will This Trigger A Rally To $80,000? 1 day ago An RSI is a technical tool used to measure the speed and change of price movements in a cryptocurrency. It is also used to determine the short-term momentum of a cryptocurrency�s market. Sharing a price chart depicting the XRP price movements from 2018 to 2025, the analyst predicts that XRP�s closing converging point and RSI pattern are signaling a massive breakout to new all-time highs. He has projected a �conservative� target that could see XRP�s price soaring between $15 and $20 in the coming weeks. Source: X Additionally, XRP�s present price actions are displaying a bullish pattern reminiscent of the one observed during its mega rally to a new all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. Marks noted that for XRP to reach the ambitious $20 price target, the cryptocurrency would have to witness a massive surge of 2,000% to 3,000%, translating to 20X to 36X from its current price. Concluding his analysis, the crypto analyst disclosed that all the factors and indicators were pointing towards a potential rise in XRP�s price. However, the exact timing of when this will occur is uncertain. More Bullish Projections For XRP XRP has been drawing significant attention from market analysts, who are projecting increasingly bullish price movements for the cryptocurrency.

    "content": "Youtuber and Internet investigator Coffeezilla has called out Artificial Intelligence (AI) company Rabbit for allegedly being built on a $6 million non-fungible token (NFT) scam. The company is accused of being responsible for the GAMA NFT Project �fraud� as part of a history of lies. Related Reading Fake NFT Project Hack? CTO Vanishes After Allegedly Stealing 94 SOL 1 month ago Down The NFT Fraud Rabbit Hole Stephen Findeisen, better known as Coffeezilla, published a YouTube video calling out Rabbit Inc. for being built on the remains of an alleged NFT fraud from 2021. The internet investigator revealed that the company is seemingly trying to hide its ties to the GAMA project. Coffeezilla unveiled the depth of the AI company�s rabbit hole by claiming that, despite raising over $30 million in venture capital (VC), Rabbit used to be called Cyber Manufacture Corporation. In 2021, the company raised over $6 million for its �next-generation NFT Project GAMA.� The project was described as a decentralized organization �with the grand goal of sending 10,000 astronauts into space to collect extraterrestrial energy.� At the time, GAMA�s founder Jesse Lyu would make �wild promises,� claiming the NFTs were just the start. According to the YouTube sleuth, Lyu declared they would create �the first-ever carbon-negative cryptocurrency powered by our sun.� The founder promised to build a clean energy grid through NFT sales owned by NFT buyers. The grid�s energy would be used to mine GAMA tokens. However, the tokens were never launched, and the project seemed to be abandoned. Its team replied to Coffeezilla�s request for comment, stating that GAMA was not abandoned but �open-sourced.� Moreover, they claimed a token was never promised, as Lyu said in 2021 that his words were not final. The team added that they live in a country that �values free speech.� Nonetheless, the internet investigator found that the �open-sourced� engine constantly crashed and was non-functional after several tests. He also highlighted that Lyu stated in several discord messages that the project�s cryptocurrency was part of the roadmap. Based on this, Coffeezilla questioned where the $6 million in funding went and whether Lyu�s new project should be trusted. Another Rabbit In The Hat? GAMA�s founder has embarked on a new project unrelated to NFTs. His latest company, Rabbit, focuses on AI technology. The company went viral in early 2024, raising $30 million in VC and selling over $20 million in consumer products. Rabbit launched their AI personal assistance device, Rabbit R1, on easter 2024. However, the project has received a lot of backlash for not living up to the hype and promises. Several tech reviewers concurred that R1 was part of a trend of releasing �unfinished� products. According to YouTuber Marques Brownlee, Rabbit�s product was �barely reviewable� and the pinnacle of �delivering barely finished products to win a race.�� Moreover, founder and CTO of WeGPT, Josh Ollin, called the project a �scam� when R1 was announced. He also pointed out on different occasions that the hype and interactions around the company were �fake impressions� from bots. Ollin called Lyu an �NFT grifter� and stated that his past behavior affected the new project due to the �shady insincere fraudulent business practices on display (fake engagement, fake bot followers, fake tech stack, overpriced vaporware).� Coffeezilla stated a similar sentiment in his video: So many of the promises of Gama didn�t happen. This is relevant to the R1 not just because this project is built on the skeleton of that scam project, it�s also because the R1 is overhyped in a similar way. Related Reading Altcoins �Maniac Phase� Preparing, Analysts Call For Next Leg Up 1 day ago As noted by the internet sleuth, Lyu has diminished his links to GAMA NFT, calling it a �fun little project� he was �involved with� during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, he considers it important for users to know the company�s �history of abandoning investors like they did with GAMA NFT.� According to the weekly chart, the total crypto market capitalization is at $2.51 trillion.

The analyst�s prognosis indicates that Ethereum, fueled by favorable market circumstances and rising investors� confidence, is poised for massive gains. This forecast comes at the heel of ETH�s recent robust price performance and increasing market optimism. Ethereum Path To Massive Rally In February, Titan of Crypto hinted at the formation of a Bullish Cypher Pattern on Ethereum�s weekly chart. �Just like for Bitcoin, a bullish cypher pattern is currently playing out on ETH weekly chart as well,� he stated.

Earlier this month, Titan of Crypto noted that the bullish cypher pattern has successfully developed, and the aforementioned price targets have all been achieved, suggesting a substantial rally is on the horizon. Potential rally to $5,300 level | Source: Titan of Crypto on X At that time, the crypto expert underscored that ETH was at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, which he also dubbed the 1st stop ($2,880). Should the coin manage to sustain this level, Titan of Crypto anticipates a move on the upside from the level. However, today, as predicted by the expert, Ethereum performed a flawless recovery from the 1st stop ($2,880) point. As a result, the crypto asset is currently forming a bull flag pattern on the weekly timeframe, citing $5,300 as the next price target for ETH to reach. However, this is not the final destination, suggesting the potential for Ethereum to surge even higher in the upcoming months. With ETH displaying strong price performance, it could mean that the Altcoin season could be coming into play in the near future. Indicator That Suggests A Price Correction On The Downside Although Titan of Crypto anticipates a massive rally for ETH, Ali Martinez has underlined the potential for the asset to decline soon. According to Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential indicator on Ethereum�s 4-hour timeframe on May 15, previously displayed a promising buy signal.

Despite the recent price momentum, the asset�s market cap and trading volume are down by 1.56% and 28%, respectively.

    "content": "We had the opportunity to speak with Yinghao from SevenX Ventures about their latest investment in UXLINK, a globally leading social platform focusing on Web3-powered group building. Yinghao shared insights into why SevenX Ventures believes in UXLINK�s potential and how it aligns with the core principles of Web3. Can you tell us about SevenX Ventures� decision to invest in UXLINK? �SevenX Ventures is thrilled to announce our investment in UXLINK,� Yinghao began. �We see UXLINK striking a delicate balance at the intersection of fundamental social principles and core Web3 concepts. Starting from the first principles of social interaction, UXLINK has leveraged profound insights into the real needs and pain points of Web3 users and projects. This has allowed them to catalyze network effects and harness intrinsic Web3 incentives and wealth effects.� What makes UXLINK stand out in the Web3 social platform space? �UXLINK has quickly become the fastest-growing network with the highest quality user accumulation and strongest monetization capability among group-oriented Web3 social platforms,� Yinghao explained. �With its core principles of openness, modularity, and convenience, UXLINK has created a user-friendly development environment for various projects and developers. This enables deep and targeted connections between projects and their user bases, solidifying network depth and expanding network boundaries. From this perspective, we are bullish on UXLINK�s ability to foster asset issuance and trading through socialization, becoming a key hub linking Web3 infrastructure and application scenarios.� Can you highlight some of UXLINK�s achievements and milestones? �UXLINK has introduced a groundbreaking user connection method and organizational structure through its �Link To Earn� mechanism and disruptive �Web3-enabled groups,\u0027� Yinghao noted. �This has led to the establishment of a unique protocol and data layer that provides substantial value to developers operating in the Web3 space. Currently, UXLINK boasts a user base of over 5.7 million registered users, with more than 100,000 groups. It also records over 1 million daily active users (DAUs) on DApps and over 300,000 on-chain daily active users (DAUs). Additionally, UXLINK�s first-season airdrop is in progress, targeting the top 10% of users and surpassing a scale of 550,000.� What is the narrative behind UXLINK�s product and ecosystem? �UXLINK is dedicated to leading an integrated social ecosystem aimed at channeling Web3 traffic, social trading, and infrastructure,� Yinghao shared. �The product ecosystem is structured into three distinct layers: Application Layer: This layer encompasses UX Discover and Social DEX, facilitating users in social discovery, participation, and investment within group contexts. It also empowers third-party developers to craft diverse applications tailored to user preferences. Protocol Layer: At the core of UXLINK�s architecture lies its protocol layer, housing social protocols grounded in real-world relationships. This framework grants users true ownership over their social connections and data. Developers leverage these protocols to deliver personalized user experiences, including AI-driven algorithms, recommendations, and group formations. By addressing the challenge of data silos prevalent in the Web3 landscape, social data becomes a potent resource for innovation. Social Liquidity Layer (Planned): The forthcoming Social Liquidity Layer aims to establish a user-centric infrastructure that tokenizes social relationships and data assets. This layer facilitates their seamless transfer across various public chains and DApps in a secure manner. Both the Protocol and Social Liquidity layers serve as robust infrastructure for developers, offering unique opportunities for innovation and user engagement.� Product architecture diagram: How does UXLINK approach authentic socialization and trusted networks? �UXLINK embodies a shift towards genuine social connections and experiences, coupled with innovation in Web3 fundamentals,� Yinghao stated. �At the heart of UXLINK is a focus on authentic interpersonal relationships that mirror real-life social dynamics. Trust, established through direct or indirect endorsements, is crucial for actions like recommendations and transactions. UXLINK�s architecture is designed to harness the power of genuine socialization, essentially functioning as a sophisticated data production machine. This generates various types of data, ranging from basic acquaintance connections to more intricate associations such as person-group, person-network, person-project, and person-asset relationships.� What are UXLINK�s strategies for assets and finance in the Web3 landscape? �UXLINK focuses on activating existing asset trading, facilitating the issuance and circulation of new assets, and accommodating different types of assets,� Yinghao elaborated. �By transforming personal relationships into valuable network assets, UXLINK increases the turnover frequency of assets and supports the issuance of new assets with new narratives and standards. On the financial side, UXLINK ensures that users directly benefit from their contributions to the ecosystem, promoting a sustainable and engaging environment.� How does UXLINK function as a connector in the Web3 ecosystem? �UXLINK serves as a super-connector, acting as a central hub between two interconnected closed loops,� Yinghao explained. �Firstly, it links users, products, and developers, addressing core needs and fostering a robust user-product community. Secondly, it bridges infrastructure, traffic, and applications, enhancing cohesion and collaboration in the fragmented Web3 landscape.� What advantages does UXLINK�s team bring to the table? �The UXLINK team epitomizes the configuration of a typical S-tier founder leading an S-tier team,� Yinghao highlighted. �With several years of entrepreneurial experience in the internet industry, the team possesses exceptional expertise in product research and development, growth strategies, operations, and fundraising. Their commitment to first principles ensures a robust product-market fit, starting from actual user needs and integrating Web3 concepts effectively.� What potential does UXLINK hold for establishing core resources in Web3? �As the pioneer of Web3 social products deeply rooted in personal relationships, UXLINK is rapidly constructing personal networks and achieving a phase of leadership,� Yinghao emphasized. �The platform�s objective monopoly on personal networks extends to defining scenarios and pricing resources, reinforcing its dominance in the Web3 space. The self-reinforcing networks of acquaintances and brands further enhance its value.� How does UXLINK balance purist and pragmatist approaches in Web3? �UXLINK�s approach of �embracing both sides� offers a promising middle ground between decentralization and user experience,� Yinghao concluded. �By integrating decentralization with user-friendly incentives, UXLINK aims to create a more balanced and user-friendly Web3 ecosystem. This approach bridges the gap between purist and pragmatist developers, fostering sustainable and widely adopted applications.� In summary, Yinghao�s insights reveal UXLINK�s thoughtful balance between idealism and practicality in Web3, creating meaningful value for developers and users alike. SevenX Ventures is confident in UXLINK�s potential to become a key hub linking Web3 infrastructure and application scenarios.\n\n",

Currently, the 90-day moving average for STH SOPR sits at 1.015, indicating short-term holders are in the green but haven�t reached the knockout blow levels seen in previous bull runs (around 1.06). This suggests there�s room for more profit-taking punches before the bulls grow weary. I�ve already mentioned that the bull market is in full swing. Barring any unforeseen Black Swan events, it could last for approximately another +/- 300 days.

Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 21, 2024 Open Interest: The Untapped Reserve Of Strength Another weapon in the bull�s arsenal is Open Interest (OI), a metric reflecting the total amount of outstanding derivative contracts (futures and options) held by traders. While the recent price surge has been impressive, the 7-day moving average for OI hasn�t witnessed the dramatic rise seen in prior bull runs. This, according to Adler, signifies a hidden reserve of strength in the market, with more firepower waiting to be unleashed. Technical Edge: Bulls Have Momentum On Their Side But technical analysis isn�t just about fancy ratios and cryptic charts. Adler identifies several technical indicators that paint a bullish picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a gauge of momentum, hasn�t broken past 70, a level often associated with overbought conditions. Bitcoin is currently trading at $70.046. Chart: TradingView This suggests the current rally is healthy and sustainable. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has surged past positive 0.05 territory, indicating significant capital inflow and a growing appetite for Bitcoin among investors.

These price points could act as roadblocks for the surging Bitcoin price.

    "content": "Pepe the Frog, once an internet darling turned controversial meme, is making a splashy comeback � this time, in the world of cryptocurrency. PEPE, the memecoin inspired by the amphibian, has seen a meteoric rise in 2024, leaving established giants Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in its dust. Related Reading Next Big Move For Bitcoin: Analysts Predict A Potential Breakout At $71,500 8 hours ago From Feels To FOMO: PEPE�s Outperformance PEPE recently shattered its all-time high, reaching a dizzying $0.000014. This impressive feat comes alongside a staggering 900% year-to-date growth, dwarfing the gains of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) This outperformance has crypto investors buzzing, with many questioning if PEPE can dethrone the reigning memecoin monarchs. Analysts point to a potential shift in investor sentiment. While DOGE and SHIB boast larger ecosystems and dedicated communities, their massive market caps limit their potential for explosive growth. PEPE, on the other hand, sits comfortably in the �mid-range memecoin� category, offering investors the allure of high returns without the baggage of a bloated market cap. Can PEPE Maintain Its Momentum? PEPE�s recent price surge is backed by some compelling technical indicators. The Bollinger Band analysis suggests bulls remain in control, with PEPE hovering above its key support level. This, coupled with the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs, could fuel another buying frenzy, propelling the coin towards its predicted target of $0.000020. Total crypto market cap at $2.5 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com However, experts caution against blind optimism. Memecoins are notorious for their wild price swings, and PEPE is no exception. A market correction or negative regulatory decisions could easily send PEPE tumbling. Additionally, unlike DOGE and SHIB, PEPE currently lacks a clear roadmap for utility beyond simply being a memecoin. This raises concerns about its long-term sustainability.

    "content": "Crypto analyst Oscar Ramos has outlined why he doesn�t believe the Shiba Inu price can go above $0.01 this cycle. He made this statement while alluding to the possibility of the meme coin reaching $0.5 at some point in the future. Why Shiba Inu Can�t Go Above $0.01 Ramos mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Shiba Inu can�t go above $0.01 because of its current supply of over 589 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The crypto analyst made this remark while sharing a prediction chart from the price prediction website Telegaon, which showed that Shiba Inu could reach $0.5 in 2040. Related Reading Why Is The Ethereum Price Up 20% Today? 1 day ago Source: Telegoan Indeed, Shiba Inu�s circulating supply significantly impacts its price, which is why the Shiba Inu team has made a conscious effort to reduce the amount of SHIB tokens in circulation through regular token burns. Shiba Inu�s burn tracker had previously noted that Shiba Inu�s circulating supply would need to be just over 85 billion for its price to even reach $0.01, as Ramos predicts. That means almost 80% of Shiba Inu�s circulating supply still needs to be burned for the meme coin to attain Ramos� price target. Crypto YouTuber Jeff had previously suggested that it was almost impossible for Shiba Inu to burn that much of its circulating supply, stating that it would take over 1 million years for Shiba Inu�s circulating supply to reduce to 100 billion tokens. However, there is no doubt that the Shiba Inu team has still made great efforts to reduce the meme coin�s circulating supply. Over 76 billion SHIB tokens were burned in 2023, while 83 billion were burned the previous year. Seeing how Shiba Inu�s price has increased since last year, these efforts are paying off. While burning 80% of Shiba Inu�s circulating supply still seems like a far-fetched goal, SHIB token burns are expected to increase exponentially, especially thanks to innovations like layer-2 network Shibarium, which uses some of the transaction fees earned for SHIB burns. Therefore, the number of token burns carried out will increase as Shibarium enjoys more adoption. SHIB Can At Least Rise To $0.011 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez had previously predicted that Shiba Inu could make a historic run from its current price level and rise to as high as $0.011. Other crypto analysts have also given bullish price predictions for Shiba Inu, although not as bullish as Martinez�s.

    "content": "Institutional investors are doubling their bets on Bitcoin, with investment funds related to the flagship crypto recording massive inflows last week. This development signals a bullish sentiment among these investors which could trigger a Bitcoin rally to $80,000. Bitcoin Investment Funds Record $942 Million In Inflows According to CoinShares� latest weekly report, Bitcoin investment products recorded a net inflow of $942 million. These inflows are said to have been �an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report on Wednesday,� with 89% of the total flows coming in the latter three trading days of last week. Related Reading Crypto Analyst Sounds Warning Alarm For Potential 50-60% Crash In Chainlink Price, Here�s Why 2 days ago The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data, which came in lower than expected, is believed to have restored investors� confidence in the market. The data showed that inflation in the US may be slowing, raising the prospect of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. Lower interest rates are good for the crypto market since they will make investors more willing to invest in risk assets like Bitcoin. The US accounted for most of the inflows into BTC, with $1 billion flowing into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs last week. Grayscale�s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has recorded over $16 billion in outflows since the ETF approval in January, also saw inflows (for the first time) of $18 million last week. This trend of significant inflows into these Spot Bitcoin ETFs likely continues this week. Farside investors revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that these funds recorded a net inflow of $237.2 million on May 20. Interestingly, none of these Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows on the day, with GBTC recording an inflow of $9.3 million. It is also worth noting that while BTC saw inflows of $942 million, there were almost no flows into short Bitcoin, with CoinShares noting that this implies a positive outlook amongst investors. Altcoins like Solana, Chainlink, and Cardano also recorded considerable inflows, with $4.9 million, $3.7 million, and $1.9 million flowing into these crypto tokens, respectively. BTC�s Bull Run Might Be Back On With the Spot Bitcoin ETFs again seeing impressive demand and recording significant inflows, there is a feeling that Bitcoin�s bull run might be in full force. These investment funds were known to have contributed significantly to the flagship crypto�s hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,750 in March.

    "content": "An analyst has explained how Polygon could see a rally of around 17% if the cryptocurrency�s price breaks above this level. Parallel Channel May Reveal What Could Be Next For Polygon In a post on X, analyst Ali has discussed about a parallel channel that Polygon has been consolidating inside during the last few weeks. The �parallel channel� here refers to a technical analysis (TA) pattern that�s drawn using two parallel trendlines. This pattern�s upper line joins successive tops in the asset while the lower one connects bottoms. While the price is inside the region bounded by these two lines (the �channel�), it�s probable to stay trapped in it, only consolidating sideways. Related Reading Analyst Says $71,000 Bitcoin Move Is Only Halfway Through, Here�s Why 1 day ago Naturally, retests of the upper line can likely result in reversals back to the downside, while the lower one may act as a source of support, helping the coin bottom out and regain an uptrend. There are different types of parallel channels in TA, like the ascending and descending ones, where the channel is slopped upwards or downwards. In the context of the current topic, though, a parallel channel parallel to the time axis is of interest. This means consolidation inside this channel occurs between the same top and bottom levels. Like with other consolidation patterns in TA, a break out of the trendlines of the parallel channel can also suggest a continuation of the trend in that direction. More specifically, a surge above the pattern can suggest bullish momentum for the asset, while a drop under the channel may spell a bearish outcome instead. Now, here is a chart that shows how the parallel channel that Polygon has been consolidating inside has looked like over the past month: The channel that the price of the asset has been stuck inside in recent weeks | Source: @ali_charts on X From the above graph, it�s visible that Polygon has been stuck in consolidation inside this parallel channel since the cryptocurrency crash last month. The asset has made some attempts at the upper level, but so far, all of them have failed, with the coin unable to find any break. MATIC is currently floating near the level, so another retest may be coming up soon. Related Reading Bulls In Control: Ethereum Longs See Biggest Candle Ever After ETF News 2 days ago If the Polygon price surges above the channel this time, it may enjoy some sustained bullish momentum. �A breakout above $0.76 could trigger a 17% surge, pushing $MATIC to $0.88!� notes Ali. This price target is based on the fact that the crash last month, which threw the asset into this consolidation, occurred starting from around that level. Given this potential retest of the upper line of the channel, it now remains to be seen how the cryptocurrency performs in the coming days. MATIC Price Polygon almost touched the $0.76 upper level of the channel yesterday, but the coin has since observed a pullback, and it�s now back down to $0.72.

The enthusiasm around a possible Ethereum ETF has sparked conversations about DOGE being the next cryptocurrency to have its exchange-traded fund. Amidst the rumors, a notable post by a crypto enthusiast, Vee, on X suggested that Dogecoin�s non-security status and widespread adoption make it an ideal candidate for an ETF.

Crypto analyst Rekt Capital earlier today highlighted on the X platform that a weekly candle close above approximately $71,500 could potentially initiate a breakout from the current �Re-Accumulation Range.� However, the analysts disclosed that history suggests that Bitcoin may need to consolidate within this range for several more weeks to align more closely with historical Halving Cycles, which have previously influenced its price trajectory. #BTC A Weekly Candle Close above ~$71500 would probably kickstart the breakout from the Re-Accumulation Range However, history suggests Bitcoin should consolidate inside this Re-Accumulation Range for several weeks more Extended consolidation here would get Bitcoin closer to� pic.twitter.com/Af0W4MMBTN � Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 21, 2024 This extended consolidation period, as highlighted by the analyst, could benefit Bitcoin�s long-term growth. Particularly, it could help the cryptocurrency �resynchronize� with previous cycles, potentially leading to a longer and more sustained bull run, as opposed to a shorter, more accelerated cycle that peaks sooner. Rekt Capital noted: After all, the current acceleration in the cycle is still around 190 days (which is an improvement from the 260-day acceleration set in mid-March when BTC made new All Time Highs) The analyst pointed out that while both scenarios are bullish, the preference between a shorter or a typically longer bull run remains a matter of market speculation. Currently, the discussion revolves around whether Bitcoin can continue to defy historical trends with a break above the $71,500 range. BTC price is moving sideways on the 2-hour chart.

Back then, Bitcoin saw a significant rise, recording a 1,200% increase on its way to the previous high of $20,000. TechDev�s analysis suggests that Bitcoin could be setting up for another parabolic rise, potentially reaching as high as $100,000, especially given its longer consolidation period in the current market cycle compared to 2017. Supporting this viewpoint, RektCapital hinted that even a price of $72,000 would seem modest in the coming months if Bitcoin continues on its projected path. #BTC Even $72000 will be a low price for Bitcoin, months from now$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin � Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 20, 2024 Notably, the surge in Bitcoin�s price recorded so far is influenced by a mix of optimism and anticipation surrounding the potential approval of Ethereum spot ETFs and increasing inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs.

    "content": "Zeebu, the industry-leading payments and settlement platform, has reached a new milestone, surpassing $2 billion in total settlement volume, a testament to the platform�s robust growth and strategic positioning within the telecom and Web3 payments sector. The growth of Zeebu must be contextualized within the broader expansion of the blockchain-based transaction space, where it is not only participating but leading the charge. In just a few months following the launch of Zeebu�s on-chain settlement platform, the company impressively managed to settle thousands of invoices, rapidly progressing from an initial $1 billion to now surpassing $2 billion in transactions. This growth underscores the platform�s scalability and the robust demand for its services. Zeebu has become a pivotal player in blockchain-based settlements for the telecom sector, offering an instant payment and settlement solution that significantly reduces transaction times from days to minutes and cuts out intermediaries through the use of smart contract technology. The core of Zeebu�s innovation is the ZBU Token, which not only facilitates global transactions but also enhances participant engagement through a loyalty and rewards system. This tokenization strategy effectively tackles common financial hurdles like high fees, delays in remittance, and issues with currency exchange, making it an ideal solution for cross-border settlements. The platform�s usage has expanded substantially, with a growing number of telecom carriers and businesses leveraging Zeebu�s capabilities. As the platform evolves, Zeebu continues to attract new users who recognize its benefits, reinforcing its position as a trusted and leading payment platform in the market. The data from Zeebu�s dashboard reveals that the overall transaction volume on the platform has already crossed over $2 Billion. At the time of writing, the number of invoices settled stands at 32k+, with total users around 465. Some of the company�s achievements this year included two massive token burn events and participation in leading telecom and Web3 events across the globe. The first token burn occurred in February 2024, removing over 236 million ZBU tokens from circulation, accounting for more than 4.7% of the total supply. The second burn took place in May 2024, removing an additional 239 million ZBU tokens, reinforcing Zeebu�s commitment to a sustainable token ecosystem through its Phoenix Protocol, which automates and governs the burn process to ensure a balanced token supply. In addition to these token burns, Zeebu has actively expanded its presence by participating in and sponsoring major telecom and Web3 events across the Middle East, the Americas, and other regions. This strategic involvement has helped Zeebu establish a strong foothold in these markets and increase its brand visibility. To further raise awareness about Zeebu, the company partnered with CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko to host several campaigns. These efforts, coupled with listings on prominent exchanges, have significantly enhanced Zeebu�s market presence and credibility. Moreover, Zeebu released a major update to its Payment Service Provider (PSP) platform, introducing governance features that enable telecom merchants to transition from passive users to active participants in the ecosystem. This update enhances the overall user experience and fosters a more engaged community within the Zeebu platform. Raj Brahmbhatt, Founder and CEO of Zeebu, added, �This milestone is a significant leap forward in our journey, clearly aligning with our broader strategic goals. As the telecom industry increasingly embraces innovative payment solutions such as blockchain, our extensive experience and proven ability to provide exceptional user experiences and customized financial solutions uniquely position us to meet the growing demands of this dynamic sector.� Looking ahead, Zeebu is set to further enhance its services, expand its ecosystem, and transition towards a more decentralized and community-driven governance model.

However, this stability might contradict the typical trading behavior associated with crypto, where volatility often presents trading opportunities. Moreover, if these whales hold onto their Bitcoin rather than sell, this behavior could be interpreted as a long-term bullish signal. It suggests that these influential market players see the potential for future price increases and are choosing to hold their positions.

This metric prioritizes price levels with higher trading volumes, offering a more comprehensive view of market trends.

Bitcoin Has Been Reacting To Binance/Coinbase Volume Changes In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the dynamics in the cryptocurrency market that arise out of the battle happening between Binance and Coinbase for spot volume dominance. Related Reading Newbie Bitcoin Whales Buying 200,000 BTC Per Week, Data Shows 1 week ago The quant shared a chart below that shows how this war for dominance has played out over the past decade. The spot volume share of the two giant exchanges | Source: CryptoQuant As the graph shows, Binance has been the much more dominant of the two platforms when considering the spot volume. The exchange is hosting five times as much volume as Coinbase. The analyst notes that the difference between the two would be even higher when considering the BTC-FDUSD pair, which isn�t included in the data depicted in the above chart. Despite the much lower spot volume, Coinbase still hasn�t been irrelevant in the market. For example, the platform is the custodian for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like BlackRock�s IBIT and Grayscale�s GBTC. There also appears to be an interesting pattern between the dominance of the American exchange and the Bitcoin spot price. The quant has highlighted this trend in the graph. There have been a few instances where a rise in the spot trading volume of Coinbase against Binance has preceded surges in the value of cryptocurrency. Similarly, declines in the platform�s dominance have seemingly led to drawdowns in the Bitcoin price. The analyst has also discussed the trend in the volumes of the two exchanges more closely, using the spot volume ratio for them, as shown below. The value of the metric seems to have been relatively low in recent months | Source: CryptoQuant The chart shows that the spot volume ratio between Binance and Coinbase had spiked to very high levels in 2023, with the former�s volume being 53 times the latter�s. The reason behind this was the zero-fee scheme that Binance had introduced for the Bitcoin trading pairs. However, Coinbase�s volume has recently risen, although the ratio remains notably in favor of Binance. This shift in the market emerged as the Bitcoin spot ETF-related news started to intensify.

Other notable sellers include the crabs, which are investors holding 1-10 BTC, selling 1,074 BTC in the same time period. Shrimps � investors holding 0-1 BTC, were also caught selling, with a total of 591 BTC sold. While Fish investors, those holding 10-100 BTC, sold only 95 BTC in the one day period. The flow of these investors shows that BTC is flowing out from smaller investors toward larger investors, something that is bullish for the price. The same is the case on the weekly timeframe where Shrimps sold 2,079 BTC, Crabs sold 5,748 BTC, Fish sold 1,155 BTC, while Sharks bought up 60 BTC, with Bitcoin whales buying the majority with 12,085 BTC.

    "content": "QCP Capital, a prominent institutional-focused firm, has recently projected that Bitcoin could revisit its peak price levels, potentially reaching up to $74,000 shortly. This prediction follows the latest United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which has significantly boosted risk assets. The firm noted that the positive surge in the market is partly due to the renewed buy-side demand, as evidenced by the buying patterns that resemble those of Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) market makers. Related Reading Most Important Bitcoin Indicator Nears Bullish Flip: $150,000 Soon? 1 week ago Institutional Inflows And Market Indicators Point To A Bitcoin Bullish Trend In a detailed analysis shared through their Telegram channel, QCP Broadcast, the firm stated: �We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of 74k.� Substantial institutional interest in Bitcoin supports this sentiment, as large asset managers like Millennium and Schonfeld have allocated about 3% and 2% of their Assets Under Management (AUM), respectively, to spot BTC ETFs. The optimism surrounding Bitcoin is not just theoretical but backed by significant market activity. For instance, inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US reached a two-week high of $303 million as of May 15th, signaling a robust renewal of institutional confidence. Fidelity�s FBTC fund led this influx with $131 million, followed by Bitwise�s BITB fund, which saw $86 million, marking its highest since early March. Grayscale�s GBTC, which had experienced outflows for four months, reversed this trend with a $27 million inflow. Yesterday, May 15, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETFs was $303 million. Grayscale ETF GBTC had a single-day net inflow of $27.0466 million, Fidelity ETF FBTC had an inflow of $131 million, and Bitwise ETF BITB had an inflow of $86.2578 million. https://t.co/npjWVH3bMi � Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 16, 2024 Further underlining this bullish sentiment, Millennium Management holds a roughly $2 billion Bitcoin ETF portfolio, making it the largest holder of specific Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock�s IBIT and Fidelity�s FBTC. Other hedge funds, including Paul Singer�s Elliott Capital and Apollo Management Holdings, have also disclosed significant holdings in Bitcoin ETFs, showcasing the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Market Performance And Future Outlook Bitcoin�s market performance has been quite notable. It has increased nearly 10% over the past week, including a 2.7% rise in the last 24 hours alone. BTC price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com QCP Capital attributes this trend to several factors, including significant �sovereign and institutional adoption, easing inflation concerns, and the upcoming US elections,� all of which contribute to a favorable market outlook. The positive sentiment is also partly due to the CPI data released on May 15th, which met expectations and eased concerns about inflation. This is crucial as lower inflation rates influence the Federal Reserve�s decisions on interest rates, making riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking higher yields. James Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Realvision, also cited the Global Money Supply (M2) index as a critical indicator of Bitcoin�s price movements. According to Coutts, the M2 money aggregates, which include cash and checking deposits and are easily convertible near money, are central to understanding liquidity flows within the global financial system. He noted, �The money stock often moves in one direction, with significant drops like those seen in 2022 being rare and typically brief.� Related Reading Bitcoin Breaks Free: Emerging from Bearish Sentiment, Crypto Market Optimism Rises 1 week ago Coutts predicts that any significant break above Bitcoin�s all-time highs could pave the way for it to reach around $150,000 in this cycle. He remarked, �Watch the 101/102 level on DXY. If that breaks, then we should see ~$150k BTC this cycle,� emphasizing the interplay between liquidity and market cycles.

A prominent crypto analyst, Ali, identified a sell signal on Bitcoin�s short-term charts using the TD Sequential indicator. Related Reading Is The Crypto Winter Thawing? US Bitcoin ETFs Record First Inflows In Weeks � Coinshares 1 week ago According to Ali�s analysis, the TD Sequential indicator suggested that Bitcoin�s current uptrend might be losing momentum. This could potentially lead to a correction over the next one to four candlesticks, particularly noticeable on the four-hour chart. The TD Sequential presents a sell signal on the #Bitcoin 4-hour chart, anticipating a one to four candlesticks correction for $BTC. pic.twitter.com/OC9Clv0Tat � Ali (@ali_charts) May 16, 2024 Diverging Bitcoin Views From Top Crypto Analysts Contrasting this perspective, another prominent analyst, Rekt Capital, recently provided a more optimistic view. According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin ended its downtrend in mid-April, breaking into an uptrend with its price surpassing previous resistance levels. This change has been marked by Bitcoin forming its first higher high since its drop to $56,000, as highlighted by Rekt Capital. This indicates a possible continuation of the bull market despite periodic market attempts to unsettle investors. The TD Sequential indicator�s sell signal comes as Bitcoin has shown a 7.6% increase over the past seven days, reaching a 24-hour high of $66,567 before retracing slightly to $65,592. BTC price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com Rekt Capital noted the significance of the $60,000 support level, suggesting that maintaining this level is crucial for further positive momentum. He remarked that the recent breakout to $66,000 is a testament to how quickly market sentiment can shift toward a bullish trend. The analyst disclosed: The Bitcoin Bull Market is not over. But time and time again, the market will try to shake you out of your positions before you are able to profit significantly from them. Insights From Galaxy CEO On BTC�s Future Trends Meanwhile, Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital commented on the broader market trends, noting that the crypto sector is at a critical juncture where narratives are evolving, and the market landscape could change rapidly, especially with impending regulatory developments in the US.

    "content": "In a remarkable turn of events, Bitcoin (BTC) has broken out of its recent trading range, recording a 7% surge in the past 24 hours alone. The cryptocurrency tests the $66,000 resistance level, setting the stage for a potential move toward higher targets. The latest momentum shift in Bitcoin�s price action has caught the attention of industry experts, particularly the co-founders of on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. According to their analysis, the trigger for a larger market structure release has been in the works since the March highs. Bitcoin Breaks Out The co-founders of Glassnode believe this breakout has been coming for a long time. They state that they have been waiting for the trigger to unleash a major bullish structure since the March highs when Bitcoin reached its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,700, and it looks like the market has finally done so. Related Reading Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu to Soar 50% Amidst Meme Coin Market Rise 1 week ago They believe the trigger was the recent lower-than-expected US inflation figures and weaker retail sales data, which could prompt a more �dovish stance� from the Federal Reserve. According to the Glassnode co-founders, this opens the door to a more dovish stance from the Fed. They explain that Bitcoin and the market liked this, and now they expect the price to reach $66,000 before $69,000 and then up towards $84,000. They also believe the altcoins will follow this move strongly. However, not all analysts are as bullish in the immediate term. Crypto trader and analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin needs to hold the $65,000 level as new support, cautioning that the $68,000 and $73,000 price levels could act as resistance and liquidity pockets. He warns that if Bitcoin loses the $65,000 support, it�s back to the �chopfest� � further consolidation and volatility. Andrew Tate Considers Dumping Fiat For BTC In a surprising move, popular internet personality and self-proclaimed �Top G� Andrew Tate has announced his intention to abandon fiat currency and invest over $100 million into Bitcoin. In a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Tate declared, �I�m about to leave fiat completely and ape over 100M into BTC.� Tate, who has faced numerous legal issues and has been banned from several social media platforms, cited his frustrations with the traditional banking system and fiat currency as the driving force behind this potential decision. �I�m done with the banks. I�m done with their money. Done with the scams,� he wrote in the post. Related Reading Ethereum Bull Flag Breakout: ATH On The Horizon As Major Metrics Turn Bullish 1 week ago In a follow-up post, Tate acknowledged that he has not finalized this decision, as he currently holds more cryptocurrency than fiat currency in his portfolio. However, he hinted that he might �leave fiat completely,� suggesting that his preference for Bitcoin and other digital assets is growing. The 1-D chart shows BTC�s trending upwards. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com As of press time, Bitcoin is testing the $65,900 mark, having regained its bullish momentum. It remains to be seen how far the current rally can extend and whether the bullish momentum can survive potential selling pressure at higher price levels.

    "content": "On-chain data suggests the Ethereum whales have shown a burst of activity recently. Here�s what these titans have been up to. Ethereum Whale Transactions Are At Their Highest Since March In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed how the ETH whales have become active recently. The on-chain metric of interest here is the �Number of Large Transactions,� which, according to the analytics firm, tracks the total number of Ethereum transactions on the network valued at more than $100,000. Related Reading Crypto Analyst Reveals Trigger For 17% Polygon (MATIC) Rally 23 hours ago Generally, only whale entities can make such large single transaction movements, so such large transfers are associated with these humongous investors. As such, the Number of Large Transactions indicator can tell us whether this cohort is active right now. The chart below shows the recent trend in this Ethereum metric. The value of the metric appears to have spiked in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X The graph shows that the Number of large transactions for Ethereum has sharply increased recently. This suggests that the whales have ramped up their activity. The whales have come alive as news surfaced that the ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could have improved their approval odds. The hype in the market has meant that ETH has enjoyed a rapid increase, taking its price back around the $3,800 level. With all this happening in the market, it�s only natural that these humongous entities would be repositioning themselves. As the scale of this cohort�s transactions is quite big, a large number of them taking place together can be powerful enough to cause ripples in the market. Thus, ETH could likely witness volatility shortly if the current high whale activity persists. However, the direction this volatility might take on Ethereum depends on whether these investors collectively buy or sell. IntoTheBlock data has also provided hints about this, as the below chart for the �Large Holders Netflow� shows. It looks like the value of the metric has been positive recently | Source: IntoTheBlock on X This indicator measures the net amount of Ethereum moving into or out of the wallets of �Large Holders.� The analytics firm defines Large Holders as those who own at least 0.1% of the entire circulating asset supply. Related Reading Analyst Says $71,000 Bitcoin Move Is Only Halfway Through, Here�s Why 1 day ago The graph shows that the Large Holders have been participating in accumulation recently, as the netflow has been positive for them. Thus, it appears that the recent activity from the whales has involved net-buying. It remains to be seen if these humongous entities will continue to display this trend in the coming days, potentially helping fuel the rally. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $3,750, up more than 26% over the past week.

    "summary": "Novogratz predicts that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely remain within a relatively narrow trading range for the current quarter.\n\n",
    "content": "Mike Novogratz, the CEO and founder of Galaxy Digital, shared his insights on the current state of the cryptocurrency market. According to Bloomberg, Novogratz predicts that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely remain within a relatively narrow trading range for the current quarter as the adoption of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance continues to evolve. Stagnant Crypto Market Per the report, Novogratz described the current phase in the crypto market as a consolidation period. He emphasized that Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), are expected to consolidate. This consolidation phase suggests that the Bitcoin price will likely trade within a range of approximately $55,000 to $75,000 until significant market events drive prices higher. Related Reading On A Tear: Toncoin Outshines Bitcoin With Price Surge And Social Buzz 1 week ago The crypto market has experienced a period of stagnation following the historic bull run witnessed in the past two quarters. This surge was fueled by the launch of spot US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the Bitcoin Halving, which reduced the supply of new BTC. However, Bitcoin�s price trend reversed due to diminishing optimism surrounding interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), amid consistently strong economic indicators. According to Novogratz�s analysis, if his predictions hold, Solana could continue to consolidate within its current trading range of $120 to $150. This consolidation has been observed over the past month, indicating a period of stability for the cryptocurrency. Similarly, Ethereum�s price has closely mirrored Bitcoin�s movements and has traded between the $2,870 and $3,200 levels. Ethereum recently failed to consolidate above the significant $4,000 mark reached in mid-March. As a result, Ethereum has experienced a period of price consolidation within the range above. Bitcoin Volatility Persists Novogratz acknowledged the tailwinds that propelled the market during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Galaxy�s CEO believes that these tailwinds will likely persist throughout the current quarter and possibly the next unless there are significant developments, such as the Fed initiating rate cuts due to an economic slowdown or until the regulatory landscape becomes clearer after the upcoming election. Moreover, Novogratz noted a significant shift in counterparties� willingness to lend crypto for extended periods without collateral, a trend that was not prevalent just six months ago. He emphasized that engagement in the crypto space has reached a new level, with growing interest from individuals and institutions alike. Related Reading CPI Preview: Bitcoin Price Poised To Surge If Projections Hold True 1 week ago On Tuesday, Bitcoin experienced a 2.7% decline, trading at $61,400. Since achieving a record high of $73,700 on March 14, the largest cryptocurrency in the market has undergone a 16% decline. Despite this, Galaxy Digital reported notable first-quarter results, with net income more than tripling to $421.7 million. The daily chart shows that BTC�s price is trending downward.

    "content": "Non-empty wallets for stablecoins such as Circle�s USDC and Tether�s USDT have been on the rise for a while now as crypto prices have recovered since the start of the year. This has come to a head as the non-empty wallets have grown double-digits in a very short time. While this could point to recent selling, it is also quite bullish for crypto going by historical performances. Non-Empty USDT And USDC Wallets Jump 13.9% According to the on-chain data tracking platform Santiment, there has been a significant shift in the number of crypto wallets that are holding stablecoins on their balances. This growth is mostly seen in stablecoins such as Tether�s USDT and Circle�s USDC. Related Reading Shiba Inu Price Can�t Reach $0.01, Crypto Pundit Reveals Why 19 hours ago As Santiment�s data shows, the total number of non-empty wallets holding USDC has risen 13.9% so far in 2024. Likewise, USDT wallets have also been on the rise, with a marked 15.7% increase in non-empty wallets in the same time period. The chart shows a steady increase in the number of these non-zero wallets as the price of Bitcoin had recovered, taking the whole crypto market along with it. The total among of USDT holders moved from around 4.5 million at the start of the year to 5.7 million at the time of the report. For USDC, this figure went from around 1.9 million to more than 2.15 million. In total, there are more than 7.85 million stablcoin wallets between the both of them. ? Concerned about another #crypto market retrace? You may be comforted by the fact that the amount of non-empty #stablecoin wallets are rising. In 2024, the amount of #USDCoin non-empty wallets has grown by +13.9%, and #Tether wallets have grown +15.7%. https://t.co/9K2y8UgOv9 pic.twitter.com/mxdkrgn36M � Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 23, 2024 Now, given the recent uptick in the number of non-zero stablecoin wallets, it could suggest there has been some selling. However, stablecoins have seen their market caps increase drastically as more coins have been minted, suggesting that investors are looking to buy rather than sell. Rising Stablecoin Wallets Is Good For Crypto The rise in the non-zero stablecoin wallets are good for crypto, especially in the event of a retrace, as the on-chain tracker points out. This is because investors usually keep their funds in stablecoins waiting for good opportunities to buy, and during market retrace, they tend to deploy stablecoins such as USDT and USDC to buy other assets for low prices. Related Reading Standard Chartered Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Set For A New ATH Above $73,700, You Won�t Believe The Timeline 22 hours ago A correlation can be seen between the rising Bitcoin and crypto prices this year and the rising stablecoin market cap. For example, the USDT market cap went from $93 billion to over $111 billion since January, signifying a 20% increase. In the same vein, the USDC market cap went from $25 billion in January to over $33 billion in May, representing a 32% increase for the stablecoin.

    "content": "A crucial Bitcoin metric has just turned bullish, sparking optimism from a crypto analyst regarding an impending rally for Bitcoin. This unique technical pattern suggests that the world�s largest cryptocurrency could see its price ascending further, potentially kick-starting a highly welcomed bull run this cycle. Bitcoin Technical Pattern Flips Bullish Bitcoin�s price has often followed distinct historical patterns, with the majority of these indicators preceding significant rallies or bearish trends. One of the most compelling signs that Bitcoin may be turning bullish again is seen as the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) Oscillator breaks below the lower Bollinger Bands, a technical indicator used to measure a market�s volatility and momentum. Related Reading Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run 5 days ago According to a crypto analyst identified as �Dominando Cripto� on X (formerly Twitter), the SSR is a unique technical tool designed to evaluate the market sentiment by comparing the supply of stablecoins to Bitcoin. This tool is used by analysts and traders to identify buying and selling opportunities for Bitcoin. Additionally, it quantifies how the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the SSR moves within the Bollinger Bands. Source: X Dominando Cripto has provided an in-depth explanation of how the SSR oscillator is calculated and how to interpret its signals for identifying bullish trends. �The oscillator is calculated by taking the difference between the current Stablecoin Supply Ratio value and its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), then dividing it by the standard deviation of the SSR over the same period,� the analyst stated. Sharing a price chart depicting movements of the SSR oscillator, the crypto analyst suggests that when the oscillator moves above the upper Bollinger Bands, it suggests that the SSR is significantly higher than normal levels. This indicates that stablecoins are dominating the market, signaling bearish sentiment and a potential downturn for Bitcoin. Conversely, when the oscillator falls below the lower Bollinger Band, it indicates that the SSR is low, highlighting the reduced dominance of stablecoins and signaling bullish sentiment that could potentially trigger an incoming rally in Bitcoin. In the above price chart, Dominando Crypto pinpointed several instances when the SSR oscillator displayed bearish and bullish sentiment, identifying these periods as heated zones and cold zones, respectively. Recent market movements indicate that the SSR oscillator is in the cold zone, indicating a potential bullish outlook for Bitcoin. More Bullish Signs For BTC On May 18, Blockchain analytics platform, Santiment, revealed a new market trend where small traders are consistently liquidating their BTC holdings, even as the cryptocurrency has shown positive performance lately. Related Reading This Crypto Trader Just Sold All His Bitcoin For Altcoins Like Cardano And XRP, Here�s Why 4 days ago The analytics platform noted that historically, when small wallets dump coins into larger wallets, it is considered an encouraging sign for Bitcoin, indicating a potential bullish turnaround for the pioneer cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency has been on a major bullish momentum recently, witnessing an 8.94% increase in the last seven days and a 4.25% surge over the past month.

    "content": "There are important developments around Render (RNDR), Ethereum (ETH), and Raboo (RABT). Render has achieved exceptional milestones, highlighting the increasing relevance of AI cryptos. Ethereum has managed to hold above the crucial $3k support level while Raboo�s presale continues to grow. These developments highlight the growing interest in AI cryptos and influence the ETH price, while Raboo stands out as a promising investment option. Render (RNDR) Reaches Exceptional Milestones Render (RNDR) has recently achieved exceptional milestones. This highlights the growing relevance of AI cryptos in the market. The Render Network offers a decentralized solution for rendering graphics. This is making it particularly attractive to artists and developers. Render�s recent successes reinforce confidence in AI cryptos� ability to transform the industry. These advancements have led to an increase in the value and popularity of RNDR.

These factors can impact Render�s long-term growth and sustainability. Ethereum (ETH) Remains Above the $3K Ethereum (ETH) has managed to hold above the critical $3k support level. This is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and momentum in the market. This development comes amid the wider adoption of AI cryptos. It strengthens the position of Ethereum as a leading platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. The current ETH price remains a major concern for anyone who relies on the stability and functionality of the Ethereum network. There are some disadvantages associated with the Ethereum project. The scalability issues and high transaction fees remain a challenge, especially compared to newer blockchains that offer better solutions. Also, the transition to Ethereum 2.0 is a long and complex process. This entails uncertainty about the future performance and stability of the network. These factors could deter investors and hinder long-term adoption of Ethereum. Raboo (RABT) Has Over $1.3m Raised Raboo (RABT) is currently in the third phase of its presale. Tokens are available for $0.0042 each. The presale has already raised more than $1.3 million. This underscores the strong investor interest in this promising project.

    "content": "The Bitcoin price recovery above the $67,000 level has triggered a round of selling, but it is not from the usual camp of large investors selling. This time around, it is the small-time traders who are offloading their bags and putting selling pressure on the price. However, this is not an entirely bad thing given that, historically, such selling has been bullish for the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin Retail Are Dumping Their Bags In a report on X (formerly Twitter), the on-chain data tracker Santiment revealed an interesting trend among small-time Bitcoin investors. As the price of Bitcoin rallied past $67,000 over the weekend, these small wallets took this as the time to sell and secure profit. Related Reading Cardano Whales Return To The Table, Increase Massive Holdings By 10% 4 days ago These wallets are those holding below 0.1 BTC on their balances. This means that at the high end, these wallets are holding an average of $6,000. In the space of one week, Santiment notes that their collective holdings had dropped 0.46%. ?? #Bitcoin is dancing just above $66.1K as small traders continue to #liquidate their holdings despite the #crypto bounce over the past week. Historically, small wallets dumping their coins to larger wallets is an encouraging and #bullish sign for $BTC. https://t.co/wlz4XPhfMD pic.twitter.com/dTJAy5G6pL � Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 19, 2024 Selling among smaller wallets is not new, but at this level, it could have a significant impact on the price. However, compared to when whale and sharks sell their BTC holdings, retail investors selling is usually bullish for the price. This is because as the smaller traders sell, the BTC is picked up by the larger traders, who are usually longer-term holdings. As blockchain agency Crynet explains in a response to Santiment: �While small traders divesting might seem concerning, it�s often a bullish signal. Historically, this redistribution to larger holders indicates stronger hands in the market. Let�s see how this plays out.� Bullish Sentiment Rises Among Investors The selling by small Bitcoin traders comes amid a jump in bullishness. As Santiment reported in a previous post, bullishness among Bitcoin investors has now jumped to a 4-month high. The last time that investors were this bullish was back in January 2024 when the price of BTC had jumped above $45,000. Related Reading Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run 5 days ago Bitcoin�s weighted sentiment is now sitting at a value of 0.99, and although this is still lower than its January high of almost 1.8, it remains one of the highest among large caps. Currently, only the Chainlink (LINK) weighted sentiment is higher after rising to a new one-year high of 1.829. ? The crowd�s sentiment has shifted toward #Bitcoin after the surprise bounce above $66K Wednesday (and now above $67.2K). Additionally, #Chainlink is seeing its most #bullish sentiment in over a year. #FOMO staying low will help these rises continue. https://t.co/TcEPBdS9Oh pic.twitter.com/czvE1mOgId � Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 17, 2024 The Ethereum weighted sentiment is currently sitting at a low -0.44, while XRP and Binance�s BNB are sitting at around -0.37. This suggests that bearishness continues to dominate among these assets while crypto investors look to Bitcoin to lead the market. At the time of writing, the BTC price is still trading at a high price of $66,900. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is seeing a 6.78% increase in the last week and a small decline of 0.5% in the last day, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

    "content": "Margex is a cryptocurrency exchange platform founded in 2019 focusing primarily on derivatives trading. However, it also offers other popular features such as copy trading, staking, price alerts, an attractive referral program, and much more. Margex�s interface is designed to be intuitive, making it an excellent choice for those taking their first steps into the world of cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Although its primary focus is beginners, it is also suitable for more advanced traders who value ease of use. Margex can be accessed through its website, mobile browser, or mobile app, which is available for Android and iOS. However, it is important to note that Margex is not available in certain countries, including the United States, the Republic of Seychelles, Bermuda, Cuba, Crimea, Sevastopol, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Sudan, and Afghanistan. The exchange is an unregulated platform based in Seychelles, which means it does not require users to go through identity verification (KYC) processes. This is a plus for traders who value privacy. However, this could raise questions about the platform�s security. Despite its lack of regulation, Margex has implemented robust security measures to ensure user protection. Three Layers of Security For Unparalleled Protection User account security includes encryption of sensitive data, two-factor authentication (2FA), and email alerts for any account activity. Crucially important features like custodian security protects assets in cold storage with multiple signatures and an access segregation system. The trading infrastructure itself ensures a smooth user experience and fast order execution by protecting against DDoS attacks and other advanced measures. In addition to these measures, Margex has a system called MP Shield that uses artificial intelligence to detect and prevent suspicious activities such as fake trades or price manipulation attempts. This system protects users from dishonest behavior on the platform. High Stakes Derivatives Trading with Up to 100x Leverage The main attraction of Margex is its ability to trade perpetual futures with leverage. Perpetual contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset without expiration, allowing traders to hold their positions indefinitely. At Margex, users can trade with leverage ranging from 5x to 100x, which means they can control a much more prominent position with a relatively small investment. Margex offers more than 60 trading pairs, including the most popular ones, such as BTC/USD, ETH/USD, and others. The platform also plans to introduce stablecoin pairs and Forex pairs with leverage of up to 500x shortly. To ensure competitive pricing and minimize price slippage, Margex aggregates liquidity from more than 12 providers, which ensures that users get current and relevant prices in the market. Designed To Boost Beginner�s Performance The Margex interface is extremely intuitive, especially in its trading terminal. It consists of three main parts: the order creation interface, the trading pairs chart along with the order book and last trades, and the order and position management interface. Margex also provides a variety of educational materials to help new users understand how the platform works and trading in general. In addition, it offers the possibility to practice with demo funds through AirUSD tokens, allowing users to perform simulated trades without real risk. Another useful feature for beginners is copy trading, which allows users to replicate the trading strategies of other successful traders. Users can invest in these strategies and share the profits with the creators of the strategies, which makes it easier to learn and profit simultaneously. Powerful Profit Opportunities All Without Trading Additionally, Margex offers several ways for users to earn cryptocurrencies. Its referral program is a stand out in the industry, allowing users to earn 40% of the trading commissions of those they refer. The more referrals a user has, the more they can earn. Staking at Margex allows users to generate returns without selling or trading their assets. The platform offers up to 5% APY, and there are no lock-in periods, meaning users can withdraw their assets anytime. Finally, Margex offers several bonuses, including a $50 sign-up bonus and a $50 first deposit bonus in deposited cryptocurrency. These bonuses can be used to cover trading fees, making the Margex experience even more profitable. Maximizing ROI With Ultra Low Margex Fees Like many other platforms, Margex utilizes a maker/taker fee model. However, Margex keeps fees ultra low to maximize trader ROI. For example, makers who add liquidity to the market only pay a fee of 0.019%, while takers who withdraw liquidity from the market pay a small fee of 0.06%. These fees are some of the lowest in the cryptocurrency trading industry. In addition, funding fees apply to open positions beyond specific funding periods, which occur every 8 hours. Funding fees vary depending on the trading pair and market volatility. Similar to maker and taker fees, funding fees are typically lower than competitors. For withdrawals, Margex does not charge fees; only the network fees required to process transactions on the blockchain apply. How to Sign Up to Margex? The registration process on Margex is simple and quick, with no KYC required. Here are the steps: Visit the Margex homepage and click on �Start Trading�.

It offers an intuitive user experience, with leverage of up to 100x and various trading pairs, making it an excellent choice for beginners.

    "content": "Utility tokens of L2 blockchains serve various purposes, from granting access to ecosystem offerings to paying fees and beyond. One such token that has been garnering significant attention lately is CHO. Serving as the backbone of Choise.ai, CHO already had numerous use cases. However, the announcement of Choise.ai�s upcoming L2 blockchain, Entropy, is supposed to give CHO a substantial boost. Other utility tokens with room for growth include ARB, OP, STRK, and IMX, and we�ll explain why we believe each of these tokens can explode in the medium to long term. CHO (Entropy) As mentioned above, Choise.ai announced the forthcoming launch of Entropy, an L2 blockchain focused on B2B and enterprise, and powered by AI. CHO will lay the foundation for Entropy�s long-term growth, fostering its scalability and sustainability. This L2 will offer a no-code environment for those seeking to create, build, and flourish in the realm of Web3. This will be accomplished through the use of AI models for smart contract generation and optimization, completely eliminating human error, ensuring seamless operation, and reducing costs simultaneously. Additionally, developers will have the opportunity to monetize their AI models through integration with a blockchain-based AI model marketplace. This level of innovation has not been seen on any other blockchain, and it will be incredibly exciting to see how things unfold from here. CHO holders will be given various kinds of benefits, such as access to new platform features, airdrops, partner rewards, and more. But that�s just the tip of the iceberg. Other perks of holding CHO include receiving up to 20% of Choise.ai�s B2B revenue through the soon-to-be-launched VLT token, which will be exclusively credited to CHO holders, giving a super boost to their staking income. CHO will also incentivize legitimate transactions within Choise.ai�s innovative Tringlr SMPC technology, which will serve as the base for ultra-secure digital wallets. Lastly, the token was recently launched on the BSC network, with a $500,000 prize pool for transfers to BSC, aligning with Choise.ai�s vision of supporting community programs and reducing transaction costs. Given all this, it�s clear that CHO has potential matched by very few other tokens. It�s a hidden gem for anyone seeking tokens with great utility. And with the impending launch of Entropy, CHO is about to get to new heights. ARB (Arbitrum) ARB is the utility token of the Arbitrum Network, launched in May 2021 with the aim of enhancing scalability, speed, and cost-effectiveness compared to the ETH network. Indeed, Arbitrum can handle a high volume of transactions with minimal latency. ARB tokens are also used for governance within the Arbitrum DAO and serve as rewards for validation nodes. Validators can stake tokens on the network, thereby enhancing its security. Despite its strengths, ARB has encountered several challenges. For example, during the ARB airdrop scheduled for last March, a significant percentage of intended recipients, around 10,000, did not receive their tokens, while some who did were subject to high fees. Although the team resolved the issues, some participants were left with a bitter taste, leading them to exit the project. OP (Optimism) Optimism, another L2 solution, utilizes optimistic rollups, which are cheaper than pessimistic rollups, enabling smooth transaction processing without causing network congestion or exorbitant fees. These optimistic rollups ensure network security with most transactions being executed automatically, but if a transaction is suspected to be fraudulent, the system undergoes a verification process to confirm its legitimacy. The OP token has two main functions: operations and governance. Holders can vote on upgrades and proposals, earn rewards for contributions to the network, and stake their tokens. However, the main problem with this network, which you could already guess, pertains to security. While the fraud-proof scheme theoretically works, there are instances where fraudulent transactions or actions go undetected, leaving the network vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors. STRK (Starknet) Starknet is a ZK rollup for Ethereum and a Layer 2 blockchain that ensures high performance, security, and low fees using the STARK cryptographic proof system. Although the blockchain is still in development, its native token, STRK, was airdropped to the community in February. There�s a lot of excitement around Starknet, and its developer community is quite strong. Anyone looking to build on Starknet can find resources in their Developer Hub, and Cairo, the network�s native smart contract language, further simplifies things for developers. Like most other L2 native tokens, STRK can be staked, used for governance, paying transaction fees, and maintaining the network. Soon, it is expected to release a range of data availability solutions and a permissionless sequencer and prover. Although the project overall seems promising, there are some posts on Reddit suggesting it could be a pump-and-dump scenario orchestrated by venture capitalists. IMX (Immutable) Immutable X is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum NFTs that supports both NFT minting and trading with no fees, is carbon-neutral, and incredibly fast, achieving up to 9,000 transactions per second. What sets it apart from other NFT marketplaces is that trades are executed instantly, ZK rollups provide high security, it includes a built-in wallet, has a global order book that aggregates NFTs from different marketplaces, and offers APIs and SDKs that make it easy for developers to build Web3 apps. The platform�s native token, IMX, is its first and native NFT. The IMX token is used for paying transaction fees, voting, and staking on Immutable X. These tokens can also be locked in staking pools. However, despite the project�s overall strength and the token�s potential, it may not appeal to people who are not interested in NFTs. Summary It looks like 2024 is the year of L2 native tokens, and since we�re almost halfway through, some of the listed tokens have already appreciated significantly, while others still have room to grow. However, among the five, it�s clear that CHO has the greatest utility. Entropy will offer a much broader range of possibilities compared to other L2s, making CHO a token with immense potential. At its current price, it�s definitely a steal and could be a good buy.\n\n",

Bitcoin Finds Strong Support Between $70,180 and $70,600 In a post on X, one analyst believes Bitcoin has strong support at around $70,180 and $70,600. The analyst explained that on-chain data shows that over 450,000 addresses collectively bought over 273,000 BTC at this price range.

If the level is to be broken, then sellers would need to make an even larger effort to break through this line, with a higher amount of BTC hitting the sell side of the equation.

After the strong uptick that saw the coin roar to as high as $73,800 in March 2024, prices plunged to as low as $56,500 this month. Prices have since recovered, but bulls have yet to break above all-time highs. While capital inflows remain moderate, Glassnode adds, volatility has decreased noticeably. Still, whether this volatility will shoot higher once $72,000 is broken remains to be seen. BTC Retraces: Will Bulls Break $72,000? All eyes are on whether BTC bulls will shake off the current correction.

Pullbacks are inevitable in bull markets | Source: @CryptoJelleNL via X Instead, the analyst is confident, saying pullbacks are a natural part of any bull market. The recent 23% correction, the analyst added, is an example. What�s important is that every retracement has been from a higher position. Therefore, the next local bottom will likely be higher than the previous one, potentially reaching around $80,000.

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) did not have the spike in price many predicted after its halving event. History had told us BTC would reach an all-time high soon after the event but it is likely the all-time prices set earlier in the year distorted its chances. Bitcoin then lost a bit of its gains and started to hiver around the $60-$62k mark. Now Bitcoin has started to rally again and, at the time of writing, is above $66k. This has led experts to ponder, what is next for Bitcoin. In an interesting piece, one crypto writer provides data that suggest the bulls could push Bitcoin all the way to $90k which would be yet another all time high in 2024. While Bitcoin may be headed to new heights we think investing in these up-and-coming altcoins could see more explosive returns on investment. We found seven presale tokens we think have the unique properties necessary to explode during the next bull run. Here they are: Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE) Sealana ($SEAL) WienerAI($WAI) 99Bitcoins Token ($99BTC) 5thScape (5SCAPE) Sponge V2 ($SPONGEV2) Pikamoon (PIKA) Let�s take a look at each project and see why they are promising investments. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet The Best Crypto Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Dogeverse- The promising new Doge alternative that�s the first of its kind Readers who pay close attention to the presale market would have noticed more Dogecoin alternatives popping up. This is not a coincidence, Dogecoin (DOGE) has only made minuscule gains when compared to other meme coins during a period of explosive growth for the whole sector. Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE) could be the final nail in the coffin as its presale indicators DOGE investors are jumping ship. The Dogeverse presale began less than two months ago but has already raised well north of $15 million. This is not normal for a meme coin so it definitely indicates a changing of the tides. Dogeverse itself is also modeled around a pup meme but this dog is a space called Cosmo. He was born with the unique ability to jump from chain to chain. This makes Doegverse a multi-chain token and also the first project that will be available on six networks. Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, and BNB Smart Chain are the layer 1s, alongside Layer 2s such as Polygon and Base. Given Solana�s surprise rise past Ethereum as the most popular network with altcoin investors, this move by Dogeverse gives it versatility for the future. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Dogeverse Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sealana- This South Park-inspired meme coin looks like the real deal As you will see this list is very heavy on meme coins. The market is exploding and April saw an all-time high 138 new releases added to the sector. Solana has been the network that has stared during this expansion as a lot of the best performers come from its network. Hoping to be next up on this list is Sealana ($SEAL). We love the subtle nature of the meme behind Sealana as it�s a well-meaning dig at crypto enthusiasts based on an inaccurate stereotype. The character Sealana is based on is actually a gamer from the �Make Love Not War� episode. The character keeps killing the boys characters in the game World of Warcraft. The joke is to be a player this strong you have to have no life and play the game 24/7. Sealana is a seal version of this character who is a patriot that is stuck in his mom�s basement trading crypto all day. We know meme coin lovers can take a joke and we think they will love Sealana. Rumors that the people behind Slerf Token (SLERF) are also involved with Sealana only strengthen our prediction that it will pump. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sealana Now\u003c\u003c\u003c WienerAI- The futuristic dog that is here to bring its investors massive gains One development the meme coin market has seen recently since its explosion in popularity is the merging of meme coins with other entities. One of the most popular is AI. The new technology has been coveted by the crypto market as many see it as a way to attract investors. WienerAI ($WAI) has taken a very interesting approach to incorporating AI into its project. Nearly every single other meme coin project has used AI to add utility in some way. WienerAI, however, wishes to go down the traditional meme coin route of the actual meme being the attraction. This means they wish to rely on virality so they have used AI to give its meme a background story. It begins in the year 2132 where we are transported to a place called New Silicon Valley. We find ourselves in a laboratory owned by a mad scientist who goes by the architect. Here he is devising an experiment that combines pups and AI. However, at the last second, he accidentally drops a sausage into the mix and we are left with WienerAI. We think this story will attract tons of investors. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy WienerAI Now\u003c\u003c\u003c 99Bitcoins Token- We can�t wait to see what this learn-to-earn platform has to offer One thing that investors should look out for when investing in a new project is industry knowledge. One example of this is when creators involved with one successful project start another. Another is what we have with 99Bitcoins Token ($99BTC). They run the biggest crypto learning platform on the market and now they have turned their attention to Web 3. They have sold over 2 million courses to crypto enthusiasts and have over 750k followers of their YouTube channel so there is a good chance a portion of you reading this have gained some valuable knowledge from them. The presale has so far raised over $1.3 million as investors seem to be excited to see what they will bring to the crypto market. How the learn-to-earn model works is investors will be able to learn $99BTC by passing through levels of the curriculum and by interacting with the community. What�s great about this is investors can learn more about the market while also earning crypto. $99BTc can be used to access premium content, purchase partner content, and of course trade on the market. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy 99Bitcoins token Now\u003c\u003c\u003c 5thScape- Get ready for a taste of the future with this VR token The crypto market prides itself on being ahead of the curve and that is exactly what 5thScape (5SCAPE) is doing with this project. They believe that the future of VR will be tokenized and they are hoping to lead the charge with this futuristic coin. If you purchase the 5SCAPE token you will have access to the best VR educational resources, the latest blockbuster movies, and of course the best VR video games. Although they do plan to release their own in-house VR goggles, the creators have made the current version compatible with other VR headsets already on the market like the Oculus. With presale tokens, the amount the project raises isn�t always indicative of how the listings will go but one that raises a lot during the presale period is still a great sign. The 5thScape presale is just about to hit the $6 million raised mark which is a clear indicator that investors are ready for the future of VR. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy 5thScape Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sponge V2- With a new P2E game added to the mix this V2 meme could be huge Sponge V2 ($SPONGEV2) is a meme coin we are very excited about. Who can blame us when you consider how successful version 1 Sponge Token ($SPONGE) was? The people behind the project have also come up with a very innovative way to go from one project to the other, a problem a lot of other projects have faced before. The process is called stake-to-bridge. Investors who wish to purchase the new $SPONGEV2, must first purchase and then stake the original $SPONGE. When they do so an equivalent amount of version 2 is purchased and stored away for them. Once the total allocation of version 1 is sold out then version 2 will launch and investors will receive their $SPONGEV2 along with their staking rewards. Sponge V2 will add an exciting P2E racing game to add utility to the ecosystem. Given how successful Sponge Token was this could make it huge. In 2023, Sponge Token was launched and soon became a cult hero. It pumped by hundreds of percent in a bearish market and eventually ended up on 10 exchanges. \u003e\u003eBuy Sponge V2 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Pikamoon- Another exciting meme coin/P2E combo we think will pump Pikamoon (PIKA) has chosen a route for its project we can fully get on board with. The meme coin/P2E crossover is always a good combination but taking inspiration from a traditional giant is the icing on the cake. The creators will be hoping to entice fans of Pokemon, one of the largest traditional gaming franchises of all time, to try this blockchain version. Players will be able to explore four different universes in the game which together are called the Pikaverse. They will do this alongside the NFT sidekick they mint at the beginning of the game. Players can earn PIKA in-game by completing challenges and battling other players. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet The Best Crypto Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Conclusion So, despite some ambitious Bitcoin forecasts we have decided to look elsewhere for coins that should explode during the next bull run. With a meme coin-heavy focus, all the projects contain unique qualities necessary to attract investors. We are confident all of them can provide a good ROI.\n\n",

    "content": "Renowned financial analyst John Bollinger has recently issued a caution regarding the potential for a Bitcoin pullback. After BTC price surged from below $66,000 to almost $72,000 at the beginning of the week, Bollinger, the creator of the widely utilized Bollinger Bands indicator, pointed to specific features in the Bitcoin price chart that suggest a consolidation or pullback could be imminent, though he clarified that his perspective was not bearish on a longer term. The Bearish Argument By John Bollinger Bollinger�s analysis focuses on the daily BTC/USD chart. His main concern centers around a �two-bar reversal� pattern observed at the upper Bollinger Band. This pattern, typically indicating a potential reversal in price direction, occurs when Bitcoin�s price first exceeds the upper Bollinger Band but then closes within it during the next trading period. Such movements can imply that the upward momentum might be losing strength. Bitcoin Bollinger Bands analysis | Source: X @bbands The Bollinger Bands on the chart consist of three lines: the lower band, the middle band (20-day simple moving average), and the upper band. These bands expand and contract based on price volatility, with the upper and lower bands set two standard deviations away from the middle band. The Bitcoin price peaked at approximately $71,977 on Tuesday, momentarily pushing above the upper Bollinger Band before closing back within it, forming the noted reversal pattern. Related Reading Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar To Highest Level In Months As BTC Price Surges Past $68,000 2 days ago Further analysis shows the 20-day moving average, the middle Bollinger Band, which currently sits at about $64,564 and acts as a potential support level in the event of a price decline. Historical data from the chart indicates crucial resistance near the recent highs around $71,500, while support levels could be seen around the $64,500 mark, where the middle Bollinger Band lies, and further at $58,300, coinciding with the lower band. The expansion of the Bollinger Bands indicates increased market volatility, particularly as the price tests resistance levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently just at 63, which is not yet in the overbought territory. In his commentary, Bollinger has clearly stated that while the setup is not fundamentally bearish, the observed technical pattern warrants caution for short-term traders. He advises monitoring for either a consolidation period where the price stabilizes, or a pullback where it retreats from recent highs. �I am not fond of the two-bar reversal at the upper Bollinger Band for BTCUSD. Suggests a consolidation or a pullback. Not bearish here, just short-term concerned,� Bollinger remarked. The Bullish Argument On the contrary, renowned crypto analyst, Josh Olszewicz (@CarpeNoctom), shared a bullish outlook on Bitcoin through a different lens, focusing on the Ichimoku Cloud indicator in the daily chart. He highlighted a �Bullish TK Cross with Price Above Cloud� on the daily Bitcoin chart. Related Reading Analyst Says $71,000 Bitcoin Move Is Only Halfway Through, Here�s Why 1 day ago This particular pattern is significant within the realm of technical analysis, especially for those employing the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator, a comprehensive tool that provides insights into market momentum, trend direction, and support and resistance levels. The �Bullish TK Cross� Olszewicz refers to occurs when the Tenkan-sen line (a short-term moving average) crosses above the Kijun-sen line (a medium-term moving average), indicating a potential uptrend. Typically, this crossover suggests that buying momentum is increasing and can signal the start of a bullish phase. Bitcoin price, 1-day chart | Source: X @CarpeNoctom The significance of this bullish signal is further enhanced by the fact that the price of Bitcoin is above the �Cloud� or �Kumo�, which is considered an area of future support or resistance. When the price is above the cloud, it�s generally viewed as a bullish signal, suggesting that the asset is in a strong uptrend and likely to continue as such. This setup provides a clear bullish scenario that contrasts with the short-term caution suggested by John Bollinger�s analysis. At press time, BTC traded at $69,846.

The coin is retesting $66,000 at spot rates, but traders expect the breakout to have been confirmed, pushing BTC prices toward $70,000. Since the surge to all-time highs in March, the coin has been on a steady downtrend, as shown in the formation on the daily chart. BTC Liquidity Is High Despite Accumulation: Analyst Therefore, as doubt creeps in, Willy Woo, a Bitcoin on-chain analyst, is calming down market participants, saying the coin is preparing for sharp gains in the days ahead.

The analyst is upbeat, arguing that though prices are down from all-time highs and appear stuck in a consolidation, the coin is still in a �warm-up� phase. Woo adds that the current consolidation period means the long-term risk is low in light of the relatively high liquidity.

Bitcoin market versus realized caps | Source: @ki_young_ju via X To explain this view, the founder noted that Bitcoin�s capitalization has been growing faster than the realized cap. The realized cap is a metric that aims to gauge the total value of all coins in circulation based on the price at which they were last moved. This trend has persisted for roughly two years historically. If this pattern holds, the bull cycle could end by April 2025. Related Reading Did A Dogecoin Whale Just Sink The DOGE Ship?

    "content": "After enduring a significant 20% price correction earlier this month that saw Bitcoin fall below $56,400 and increased outflows from the Bitcoin ETF market, the world�s largest cryptocurrency has managed to stage a strong comeback. It has broken above the key $66,000 resistance level and turned it into a new support zone. BTC Bounces Back As Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar The resurgence in Bitcoin�s price has been closely tied to a rekindling of inflows into the US spot Bitcoin ETF market. Data from Farside shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their best inflow week in two months, with the US fund category collectively notching $948 million in positive net flows from May 13 to May 17. Interestingly, the majority of these inflows, approximately 89%, occurred in the last three trading days of the week, which industry analysts and researchers such as James Butterfill of CoinShares attribute to a shift in investor sentiment following the release of a lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Wednesday. Butterfill stated: The inflows were an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report, highlighting our view that Bitcoin prices have recoupled to interest rate expectations.

Notably, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has seen outflows of $16.6 billion since the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF in January, saw small inflows totaling $18 million. Beyond just spot Bitcoin ETFs, the digital asset investment product space experienced inflows for the second consecutive week, totaling $932 million, according to CoinShares. However, trading volumes remained relatively low at $10.5 billion, compared to the $40 billion seen in March. Bitcoin Poised For Further Gains? The renewed institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and the broader digital asset space has coincided with a strong price recovery for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin�s ability to firmly hold the $66,250 support level, with over 530,000 BTC traded at this price, has given analysts confidence in the asset�s potential for further gains. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, if the $66,000 support holds, Bitcoin could see strong potential for further gains in the coming days, demonstrating the bullish sentiment surrounding the largest cryptocurrency on the market. However, while Bitcoin has managed to bounce back above the crucial $66,000 level after the recent pullback, the leading cryptocurrency still faces a critical test as it attempts to break out of its established trading range.

The analyst further explains that Bitcoin has been oscillating between its low and high range between $60,000 and $70,000 for over two months, a natural consolidation process. As part of this, Rekt Capital believes that Bitcoin should be able to revisit the range high of $71,500 over time. The daily chart shows that BTC�s price is trending upward.

Related Reading Historical Trends Unveil Bitcoin Peak Timing in Current Bull Cycle 2 months ago At this point, Crypto Con believes there is still a lot of room for growth in the upcoming days. Thus, BTC�s current position, which is around a year from cycle peaks, places this cycle�s peak between January and February of 2025. However, December 2024 remains the analyst�s focus, which, at the current rate, is expected to be the cycle�s top month. BTC to top out in January � February 2025 | Source: Crypto Con on X Crypto Con further hinted at the recent recovery from a perfectly healthy correction observed in the crypto market as a potential catalyst to drive the price of Bitcoin higher. The post read: The SMI tells us that Bitcoin is right where it should be in the cycle, with much more room for growth. Our current position lines up at about 1 year from cycle tops, which would make this cycle�s top in Jan � Feb 2025. My eye is still on December 2024, a likely cycle top month at our current rate. Given that the analyst previously predicted BTC to reach $149,000 by the end of the year, it could mean the expert expects the asset to top out at the level by December. �Bitcoin is still on track for a layer 7 price target of $149,000 by the end of this year,� he stated. Crypto Con�s prediction is in line with the most precise measurements for Log Regression Curves and the cycle tops in 2021. By then, the more cautious layer 6, which is the layer that denoted the 2013 cycle top, aims to reach the $108,000 level. During the prediction, the expert highlighted a price consolidation, which is a new development in this cycle. However, as volatility decreases, this consolidation is accurate. Determining BTC�s Peak Through Fibonacci Extension Crypto Con has also utilized the Fibonacci Extensions to determine the Bitcoin price peak this cycle. According to cycle retraces highlighted in his chart, the first two cycles approached the 2.618 extension quite closely, while the last struck the 1.618 extension. Related Reading Economist Foresees $115,000 Bitcoin Peak, Followed By Largest Crash Since 1929 4 months ago On the possibility that the 1.618 point will repeat itself this cycle, BTC�s price will be at $159,128. �This is one of the many perspectives to be balanced in the basket of possibilities, and I would consider this estimate to be on the optimistic for this cycle,� he added. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is slowly gaining momentum toward $70,000, indicating a 5% increase in the past week. Its market cap is down by 0.25%, while its trading volume is down by 12% in the past 24 hours.

    "content": "The development of Web3 ecosystems is a significant milestone in the digital domain. They use decentralized and blockchain-based solutions that can transform several industries. These ecosystems aim to modify our approach to managing digital assets, data, and transactions, transforming online interactions as we now understand them. While there is widespread excitement about Web3, it is crucial to remember that mere popularity does not guarantee sustained success. Several platforms have had challenges sustaining their progress due to a deficiency in ongoing community engagement and expansion. Essential Elements of a Strong Community The main support mechanism of a robust Web3 ecosystem is its capacity to attract and retain developers. These ecosystems� applications, innovations, and structures are mostly the developers� work. Three main criteria drive their engagement: security, speed, and pricing. Developers seek platforms that provide economical solutions to optimize their spending and manage resources effectively. Additionally significant is speed since developers must quickly offer applications and transactions to stay competitive in rapidly changing markets. Similar importance is attached to security; developers want tight guidelines and protections to keep their data and assets secure from threats. Web3 platforms hoping to establish a vibrant developer community must adhere to the 80/20 rule. This concept holds that creating an environment that fully satisfies developer needs should receive 80% of the work. Platforms that stress building safe, efficient, and reasonably priced infrastructure may provide a solid foundation for developer participation and innovation. Nonetheless, the remaining 20% of funds must be allocated to outreach and incentive initiatives. Although a good environment attracts developers, intentional outreach and incentive schemes are needed to boost community growth and maintain involvement. Platforms may effectively include developers through clever partnerships, targeted marketing campaigns, and special incentive plans, creating a vibrant ecosystem driven by collaboration and creativity. Proactive Outreach and Incentive Programs Prom, a Layer 2 solution aimed at improving interoperability across multiple blockchain networks, including EVM and non-EVM compatible chains, is one platform that uses incentive programs. It sends transaction proofs to additional chains on the selected Settlement chain, boosting connections across ecosystems. Prom, powered by Polygon, reduces transaction costs using zkSNARKs technology, making it a low-cost blockchain solution. It also uses Polygon Zero and powerful recursive STARK technology for quick transactions and scalable dApp development, which appeals to both developers and consumers. Furthermore, Prom�s EVM-equivalent design facilitates integration with the current Ethereum infrastructure, simplifying development and lowering costs. Prom emphasizes aggressive marketing and comprehensive incentive schemes to increase network participation and foster a dynamic community. It works with teams and products that are vital to the expansion of the ecosystem, as well as providing grants and assistance to projects that contribute to Prom�s development. Prom�s incentive scheme includes a referral program that pays users $PROM tokens to introduce friends and expand its user base. In addition, Prom provides fee kickback rates ranging from 10% to 50% to encourage community members to actively participate in the referral program. Creating the Ideal Environment for Developers To build a favorable environment for developers in Web3 ecosystems, platforms must solve their primary concerns: price, speed, and security. They should strive to create cost-effective solutions that enable developers to effectively manage resources and maximize the value of their investments. Speed is also important since developers must launch applications quickly and interface with blockchain networks smoothly to remain competitive. Strong security measures are also required to safeguard developers� assets and data from attacks while increasing confidence in the platform. Successful systems that focus on developer demands provide useful examples. They have incorporated novel methods to increase price, speed, and security, creating a community where developers can interact and contribute. Partnerships, infrastructure optimization, and support campaigns have made these platforms ideal for developers seeking to construct and deploy decentralized apps. However, establishing the best atmosphere for developers is a continuous effort. Platforms must be adaptive, always monitoring and adapting to changes in developer expectations and market trends. Platforms that respond to feedback may improve their products to better suit developers� changing demands. This continual adaption is critical for being competitive and relevant in the ever-changing Web3 scene, as it ensures that platforms remain appealing and useful to developers looking to cooperate and create within decentralized ecosystems. Potential Challenges Building strong and long-lasting communities on Web3 platforms isn�t without its challenges. Maintaining relevance in continual technological and business upheavals is a major challenge. Platforms also struggle with the harmony between decentralization and governance to include the community while preserving direction. Platforms try to welcome individuals from all origins and points of view; hence, it might be difficult to guarantee diversity and inclusion in the community. The long-term sustainability of Web3 platforms relies on their use of focused operations and strategic approaches. It takes open and honest channels of communication that promote trust and collaboration for platforms to deal with problems and seek guidance. Those who can access educational resources and support services could become more active and transform their communities. If we want to create a warm environment where everyone feels valued, diversity and inclusion programs must be encouraged. Platforms should also prioritize scalability and interoperability in order to collaborate with other networks and adjust to the community�s evolving requirements. By making partnerships and funding strong technological infrastructure, platforms could overcome large-scale challenges and promote innovation. Using decentralized governance techniques, community members may acquire agency and guarantee that decisions are made openly and advantageously. Conclusion Building a strong Web3 group takes a lot of time, work, and money. It�s more important to be proactive and thoughtful than to be famous for a short time. To be successful in the difficult Web3 environment over the long term, platforms must focus on community-building projects. By investing in involvement and partnerships and adapting to changing needs, platforms can build strong communities that encourage working together and creativity. I want platforms to take action and focus on building active and welcoming communities. This will set the stage for future growth and development in the Web3 environment.\n\n",

Although momentum appears to be picking up, bulls are not out of the woods just yet. Analysts are not losing hope and remain overly upbeat, expecting a surge that would take the world�s most valuable coin to new levels. Bitcoin Forms A �Cup And Handle� Formation In The Weekly Chart In a post on X, one of them, MikybullCrypto, said Bitcoin has formed a �cup and handle� reversal pattern, suggesting an imminent surge towards new all-time highs. This formation is a glimmer of hope for optimistic traders, especially now that prices have been moving lower and sideways, erasing gains posted in March.

However, lurking beneath the optimistic outlook is a potential storm cloud: declining on-chain activity. After the brief spike in on-chain activity on Halving Day due to the launch of the Runes protocol, transaction fees have been declining. According to YCharts, it is currently at $3.206, down from over $128 on April 20. This contraction means miners are getting less revenue, heaping more pressure now that there is more pressure on margins post-Halving. Related Reading XRP To Nearly $600?

Analysts are divided on whether a bullish breakout or an extended consolidation period lies ahead. Related Reading Solana Leaves Competition In The Dust: Blazing Speed To Fuel Price Surge? 2 days ago Reaching New Highs: Euphoric Bulls On The Horizon? Renowned crypto analyst Checkmate has ignited a spark of optimism with his �Euphoric Bull� theory. According to Checkmate, a surge to a new all-time high could signal a critical shift in market sentiment. This type of bull phase would represent a significant acceleration in bullish momentum, potentially leading to a steeper price increase. Checkmate�s theory hinges on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a metric that compares the current market value of Bitcoin to the total value paid to acquire all Bitcoins in circulation. Historically, when the MVRV ratio climbs above one standard deviation of its average, it has often preceded a shift to a �Euphoric Bull� phase. #Bitcoin breaking to a new ATH has historically represented a transition point from the Enthusiastic Bull, into the Euphoric Bull. It also coincides with the MVRV ratio getting above 1 standard deviation, but we rarely clear it on the first attempt. Bull�Crab�Bull� A� pic.twitter.com/4YyD179LRS � _Checkmate ??????? (@_Checkmatey_) May 21, 2024 However, Checkmate warns that Bitcoin doesn�t always follow the script on the first try. The market often exhibits cautious behavior, with Bitcoin potentially attempting to breach this key MVRV level multiple times before a decisive breakout. Bitcoin�s recent consolidation period comes after a surge that saw the alpha crypto reach a six-week high of $71,950. While a slight pullback has occurred, Bitcoin is still trading comfortably near the $70,000 level, with a healthy daily trading volume. This price movement suggests a potential pause before the next significant move, making the current moment a tense waiting game for both traders and investors. Breakout Or Consolidation? A Bullish Dilemma Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has emerged as a key voice in the ongoing debate. Rekt Capital believes a weekly candle closing above $71,500 could be the catalyst for a significant breakout. This milestone, if achieved, could trigger a surge in bullish momentum, propelling Bitcoin towards a notable uptrend. BTCUSD trading at $69,460 on the weekly chart: TradingView.com However, Rekt Capital also acknowledges the possibility of an extended consolidation phase. Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited a tendency to consolidate within its re-accumulation range for several weeks before experiencing a breakout. This extended consolidation, Rekt Capital argues, would bring Bitcoin closer to aligning with historical halving cycles, events that have historically preceded major bull runs. Related Reading Bitcoin Seen Breaching $73,000 As �Bull Run� Looms, Analyst Says 1 day ago Bitcoin Price Prediction Meanwhile, other analysts are predicting a potential banner year for the world�s leading cryptocurrency in 2025.

Source: CoinCodex However, a dose of reality is necessary. The wide range between the predicted high and low ($69,971) underscores the inherent uncertainty in these forecasts. Bitcoin�s notorious volatility, evident in the recent 4.47% price swings within just 30 days, further complicates things. While this level of greed suggests investor confidence, it can also be a warning sign of a potential market correction on the horizon. Featured image from Vecteezy, chart from TradingView\n\n",

There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5320 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

    "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons have recently gone through a crossover. Here�s what it could mean for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Suggest Miner Capitulation Is On As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a Quicktake post, miners are capitulating right now if the Hash Ribbons indicator is to be believed. This on-chain metric is generally used to determine whether miners are in distress. BTC runs on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism where miners play the role of validators and compete against each other using computing power to get a chance to add the next block to the chain. This computing power, when measured across the network, can provide insight into the health of the miners as a whole. Due to this reason, the Hash Ribbons indicator makes use of this total Bitcoin �Hashrate� to judge the situation of the miners. Related Reading Bitcoin Price Linked To Binance Vs Coinbase Battle, Quant Reveals 1 week ago Naturally, a rise in the Hashrate suggests the network is attracting miners right now, while a decline could imply low profitability is making some of these validators pull out from BTC. The Hash Ribbons indicator uses two moving averages (MA) of the Hashrate, 30-day and 60-day, to represent whether these behaviors are particularly intense or not at the moment. When the 30-day ribbon moves under the 60-day one, it suggests that miners are mass capitulating. On the other hand, the opposite cross suggests network is observing growth again. Now, what relevance do these trends have for Bitcoin? According to Charles Edwards, the creator of the Hash Ribbons, the miners have historically been quite resilient, and they only quit when things get especially bad for the cryptocurrency. As such, the market may be more likely to approach a bottom whenever these chain validators show capitulation. Below is a chart that shows how the miners� behaviour has looked recently according to this indicator: Looks like the two ribbons have gone through a cross recently | Source: CryptoQuant As Maartunn has highlighted in the graph, the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons have seen a crossover recently. More specifically, the cross has involved the 30-day moving under the 60-day, implying that the miners are capitulating. Miner profits come down to three factors: BTC spot price, transaction fees, and electricity costs in the area that they are located in. Historically, the fees has been quite low in comparison to the block rewards, so miner financials have been dependent on the price (as the block rewards only have this variable attached to them) and electricity prices. Recently, the BTC price has been stuck in consolidation while the block rewards have been slashed in half in the latest Halving event. This has led to tightening revenues for these chain validators, so it�s not surprising to see that the miners with the least efficient machines have already started ditching the network in hordes.

It�s visible that while miner capitulation has generally indeed occurred near profitable buying points into the asset, these bottoms haven�t immediately appeared after the crossovers have occurred. As the analyst notes, �It unfolds in the subsequent days and weeks after less efficient miners throw in the towel.� BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to move overall flat over the past week as its price is still trading around $62,700.

    "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross still has a high value, a sign that may be bearish for BTC. Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Is Still Near Historical Top Zone In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the recent trend in the NVT Golden Cross for BTC and its implications for the price. The NVT ratio is an indicator that tells us about how the Bitcoin market cap compares against its transaction volume. The metric is generally used to judge whether the asset�s price is fair or not right now. Related Reading Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Form Capitulation Signal: What It Means 1 week ago When the indicator�s value is high, it suggests the network�s value (that is, the market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins (the volume). Such a trend implies that the asset may be overpriced currently. On the other hand, the low metric means the cryptocurrency�s price may be undervalued due to a rebound as the market cap is low compared to the volume. In the context of the current topic, the NVT ratio itself isn�t of interest; rather, it is a modified form called the NVT Golden Cross. This metric compares the short-term trend (the 10-day moving average) with the long-term trend (30-day MA) of the NVT ratio to identify tops and bottoms. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this Bitcoin indicator over the past couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have been relatively high in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant In the graph, the quant has highlighted the two relevant zones for the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross. It would appear that when this metric is above 2.2, a top can be probable for the cryptocurrency as its price is overvalued in this zone. Similarly, the NVT Golden Cross being under -1.6 can lead to a bottom formation for the asset. The Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has ventured into the red territory for the last couple of months. Each time it has seen a decline out of the zone, it has followed up with another rise into the zone. As such, it hasn�t been able to visit the bullish region yet. At present, the metric has just made another exit out of the top zone, but its value is still quite near it. Thus, while a top may not be especially probable now, a lasting uptrend is also unlikely to happen. Related Reading Bitcoin Price Linked To Binance Vs Coinbase Battle, Quant Reveals 1 week ago It�s possible that Bitcoin won�t be completely out of danger of observing more price drawdowns until the NVT Golden Cross can see a decrease in the green zone. It now remains to be seen how the indicator develops in the near future and whether its changes will affect the BTC price.

Related Reading XRP \u0026 Cardano Whales Load Up Bags: Preparation For Altcoin Rally? 6 days ago This means that the prices of the assets where there was a higher volume of trading have a higher weightage in the average than those with only a low amount of volume. Traditionally, the VWAP is a technical analysis indicator that considers the information available through spot exchanges. In the context of the current topic, the VWAP uses the on-chain volume of Bitcoin instead, which is readily viewable by anyone thanks to the blockchain�s transparency. The indicator of interest here isn�t the VWAP but rather the VWAP Oscillator, as mentioned earlier. This metric keeps track of the ratio between the BTC spot price and the VWAP and presents it as an oscillator of around zero. The chart below shows the trend of this Bitcoin indicator over the past couple of years. The value of the metric appears to have been negative in recent weeks | Source: @woonomic on X The above graph shows that the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator has been in negative territory for the past couple of months. However, the metric�s value has been rising recently, so if it continues on this trajectory, it might approach the neutral mark shortly. In the chart, Woo has highlighted a trend that the indicator and the cryptocurrency�s price have historically shown. It seems that whenever the metric has formed a bottom in negative territory and rebounded back to the upside, the asset has enjoyed some bullish momentum. The resulting price surge may last until the indicator reverses into the positive territory and forms a top. That hasn�t happened for the VWAP Oscillator this time yet. �Still a lot of room to run before reversal or consolidation,� says the analyst. �Hate to be a trapped Bitcoin bear right now.� Related Reading Bitcoin Not Out Of Danger Yet, NVT Golden Cross Warns 1 week ago In other news, as CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr. pointed out in an X post, retail investors have bought $135.7 million worth of the asset over the past month.

    "content": "Recent developments in the crypto market indicate a strong bullish sentiment among Ethereum traders, particularly in the options market. Amid the growing anticipation for potential approvals of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), there has been a noticeable shift in option pricing, with Ethereum call options becoming more expensive than put options across all expiries. This pricing pattern suggests the market is optimistic about Ethereum�s price prospects. Notably, A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specified price within a specific time frame. Related Reading Is Ethereum Set For A Major Rally? Options Traders Bet Big On $3,600+ Targets For June 1 week ago This option type is typically purchased by traders who believe the asset�s price will increase. Conversely, a put option provides the holder the right to sell the asset at a predetermined price and is often used as protection against a decline in the asset�s price. Market Indicators Point To A Bullish Ethereum Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit, highlighted this trend in his communication with The Block. He noted that the �put minus call skew is negative across all expiries and increasing further beyond the end-of-June expiry, a quite bullish signal.� Additionally, the basis, or the annualized premium of the futures price over the spot price, has increased to around 14%, further reinforcing the bullish outlook. The analysis reveals that traders prefer to purchase call options at a premium compared to put options, particularly for those set to expire at the end of June and later. This pattern is a sign of a bullish market, indicating that traders are not as interested in securing protection against potential price drops as they are in anticipating that Ethereum�s value will keep climbing. Meanwhile, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unexpectedly asked for changes in filings, there has been a resurgence in optimism regarding the possible approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. This optimism has translated into significant market activity, with Deribit experiencing nearly unprecedented trading volumes. Strijers remarked, �We recorded an almost unprecedented trading volume of $12.5 billion notional over the last 24 hours.� This surge in trading volume and market interest reflects how traders and investors position themselves to capitalize on the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. According to data from Deribit, over $480,000 calls will expire by the end of this month, with a notional value of more than $1.7 billion.

ETH Price Performance And Forecast Meanwhile, Ethereum is undergoing slight retracement, down by 2.4% in the past 24 hours, with a trading price of $3,690. Despite this pullback, the asset has maintained a strong uptrend, rising nearly 25% over the past seven days. ETH price is moving upward on the 4-hour chart.

However, the current leg up is just the beginning for Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst. Bitcoin Rally Getting Started: Analyst Taking to X, Woo, who has been maintaining a bullish outlook for the world�s most valuable coin, boldly asserts that the current Bitcoin rally is only halfway through its welcomed bullish journey. Sharing a chart, the on-chain analyst notes that the Bitcoin VWAP oscillator just bottomed up from oversold territory and is now at the zero mark, which is midway. Though Woo is upbeat and expecting even more gains, the analyst didn�t specify when or at what level prices will peak. Related Reading Shiba Inu Breaks Out Of Bull Flag Pattern-Like, Signaling Uptrend 2 days ago Even so, the analyst explained that a period of consolidation below the all-time high is necessary. Woo says this consolidation might allow users to accumulate before a �second leg� propels the Bitcoin to new heights. Looking at the Bitcoin daily chart, this �second leg� is expected to be a breakout moment that will lift the coin above March highs. Bitcoin prices trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView At press time, Bitcoin is still in a bullish formation. The uptick above $68,000 and last week�s high were crucial for trend definition. Moreover, since the May 20 breakout bar is wide-ranging and has a high trading volume, the odds of trend continuation are high. If bulls follow through, confirming May 20 gains, BTC will likely break $73,800, aligning with Woo�s forecast. BTC Bull Run To Last 300 Days If There Is No Black Swan Event Besides Woo, another analyst says the Bitcoin uptrend is in full swing. Sharing a chart, the trader said that barring any unforeseen disruptions, such as the impact of a major exchange going bankrupt, it is highly likely that the current bull run will extend for another 300 days. Bitcoin uptrend is in full swing | Source: @AxelAdlerJr via X This prediction is based on profit and loss analysis of short-term holders (STHs) with a 90-day moving average. Currently, the STH is moving lower but is relatively higher. Analysts use the STH to determine market sentiment from short-term price movements and trader speculations.

    "content": "Crypto whales are making moves following the recent bear market. With Bitcoin increasing to $66,000, experts believe several projects could see significant rallies over the next few weeks. Three projects that have already caught whale attention are Chainlink, Rollblock, and Binance Coin (BNB). With all projects already in the green, experts believe they could see significant rallies, with Rollblock poised for returns of over 720%. Chainlink Passes 100% Annual Returns Chainlink�s impressive performance has continued in Q2, taking the altcoin�s annual returns to 107%. This milestone has triggered an influx of new investors, and Chainlink�s daily trading volume is up by 25.95% over the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, Chainlink was trading at $13.82 and boasted a market cap of $8.1 Billion. Since its launch in 2017, Chainlink has showcased exceptional growth, outperforming many of the market�s top cryptocurrencies. Following its recent rally, experts believe that Chainlink could pass $20 in 2024. As a result, crypto whales are doubling down on Chainlink (LINK) tokens to optimize their portfolios. Binance Successfully Implements New Security Protocol Binance recently implemented an �antidote� to the growing problem of address poisoning. This is when an investor is tricked into sending funds to a fraudulent address. This new algorithm has already been a huge success and has identified over 13.4 million spoofed addresses. This is a huge boost to the Binance Coin ecosystem. Given that crypto scams are on the rise, this development brings a much-needed sense of security to Binance Coin and the Binance Smart Chain. Since this update, Binance Coin�s price has increased by 2.29%, and Binance Coin (BNB) is now trading at $580.85. Having already experienced a strong performance in 2024, experts believe that Binance Coin (BNB) could be one of the market�s top cryptos in May. But how does Binance Coin compare to Rollblock? Why Are Crypto Whales Flocking to Rollblock? Rollblock is attracting cryptocurrency whales with its GambleFi protocol. This innovative project is one of the first to apply blockchain technology to the gambling industry, and its impact could be pivotal. By using blockchain technology, Rollblock is able to solve major industry issues such as transparency and security. Rollblock has already launched its casino, which showcases over 150 different games. The platform is fully licensed and will also introduce sports betting options over the next few months. These will cover major sports, including MMA, golf, boxing, soccer, and the NFL. One reason whales are buying Rollblock is its revenue share opportunity. Rollblock will share up to 30% of its daily revenue with $RBLK token holders. It will do this by using revenue to buy back $RBLK tokens on the open market, burning half of the tokens it buys. The remaining half will be used for staking rewards, offering some of the most lucrative passive income opportunities in the crypto market. This could become a great way for investors to build passive income streams and has been a key factor in Rollblock�s rapid growth. Currently in stage 2 of its presale, investors can buy $RBLK tokens for just $0.012. Experts believe tokens could increase in value by 720% during the Rollblock presale, and as a result, tokens are in high demand. Crypto Whales Take Advantage of Rollblock Returns Rollblock has a long-term roadmap in place, with big plans to pioneer developments in the gambling industry. With little competition, experts believe that Rollblock could quickly become one of the world�s top cryptocurrencies. With the price of RBLK expected to increase up to 880% in the presale alone, many investors are choosing to buy early to maximize their returns.

    "content": "Things are moving fast in the crypto scene � now a new meta of Telegram clicker apps has appeared on the market, dwarfing the neverending multitude of the sophisticated capital-heavy DeFi and GameFi apps by attracting millions of users. MemeFi is at the forefront of the new narrative, with unexpected ties to Linea, an EVM chain, rather than TON, a native Telegram blockchain. MemeFi is an ecosystem featuring two mass-appeal apps: Web3 Social Tech game and a Telegram Clicker App. A simple clicker idle game has attracted more than 6.5M users, with DAU standing at an astonishing 1.5 million users. Gamify and conquer! Still, MemeFi leads the way, firmly resting in the top 3. One important and a rather unique feature of the app is the gamification � a testament to sophistication in simplicity. While tapping, the user actually fights various cartoon-styled meme bosses and does damage to them. If the boss runs out of health, the player ascends to a new level, with a new boss unlocked and more coins to earn. This does not exhaust the gaming aspect of the app, as players are limited in energy and may engage various boosters, as well as make upgrades in order to improve their experience. Coupled with a unique art style, created by a full-blown art studio who seem to know well the exoteric culture of crypto memes, the game is visually appealing and much more engaging than simpler clicker apps. It might be quite fair to say that social media abound in MemeFi-inspired videos and other types of content. Novel hyper-competitive Web3 app on Linea When it comes to novelty, MemeFi Web3 app certainly has a lot to offer. The app is an idle game that comes with a spin: players unite in meme clans and fight ridiculous crypto-inspired bosses to earn rewards that other players can tap into via keys! Keys are a Social Tech feature introduced last summer, with the release of friend.tech, that represent players� social capital. Since their prices are not directly set by supply and demand but rather change along a bonding curve through a liquidity pool mechanism, users are incentivized to behave in a competitive manner, speculating on key prices. MemeFi turned the bonding curve-powered asset into a sort of a bond, as players receive yield based on their share of another player�s key supply. This provides an economically-viable framework for keys that elevates them much higher than just a mere representation of social capital, which is, to say the least, quite an ethereal notion. The new way �to do Social Tech� has attracted the attention of Linea, a leading player in the L2 sphere. With the MemeFi Web3 app launching on Linea, as well as social media activity, it is quite clear that the project has strong ties with the blockchain team. Even more obvious is that the Clicker App might have a bigger role to play in the development of the Linea ecosystem. Telegram app� on Linea? The immense potential and the number of clickers have been realized quickly by many in Web3. First leveraged by TON via Notcoin, along with top tier exchanges, including Binance, OKX and ByBit, the never-seen-before-in-crypto traffic is being channeled to their corresponding products. Now that TON has become too competitive of an environment for clickers, other blockchains might be looking at opportunities to grow their userbases tapping into these apps� massive audiences. Linea seems to be a leader in this regard, becoming a close partner of one of the most used mass-appeal apps on Telegram. This suggests Linea is highly motivated to provide full support to the MemeFi team, taking advantage of their success and upcoming listing. Now we are at a breakpoint where we might soon witness a mass conversion campaign of MemeFi users to Linea and the MemeFi Web3 app. With clickers becoming the new narrative, MemeFi is one of the few apps that might attract a completely new audience to an EVM chain rather than TON � if successful, this will certainly threaten the current status-quo, where TON is able to monopolize the user base of Telegram, being closely associated with the social media giant.\n\n",

    "content": "The crypto industry has been dominated by the recovery of major cryptocurrencies and regulatory developments, but one unexpected player has taken the market by storm. Black Phoenix, a payment system protocol, and its native token, BPX, have witnessed an astonishing surge in price, outperforming the entire market with historical performance. Notably, Black Phoenix�s BPX token reached an all-time high of $2.60 on May 22, propelled by a staggering 4,400,000% growth in the past 24 hours and over 6,500,000% in the past fourteen days. This unexpected victory has caught the attention of investors, prompting them to examine the protocol�s underlying principles and design more closely. Exploring The Black Phoenix Design According to the protocol�s �Black Paper� released in April 2021, Black Phoenix presents a fully on-chain liquidity protocol for instant cryptocurrency token swaps in a decentralized manner on any smart contract-enabled blockchain. The protocol�s design aggregates liquidity within each blockchain, claiming to offer �the best rates� for takers executing trades. Additionally, Black Phoenix envisions a connected liquidity network facilitating seamless cross-chain token swaps across its networks on different chains, with its token based on the Tron (TRX) blockchain.

BPX aims to eliminate �inefficiencies� in the existing protocol and attract a broad user base, ultimately creating a marketplace for distributed infrastructure services. Black Phoenix�s long-term and short-term goals revolve around achieving reputable exchange listings, increasing the token�s value, and expanding the user base. Currently, BPX tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Black Phoenix is FameEX, where the most active trading pair BPX/USDT has a trading volume of $2,809,201 in the last 24 hours, which has been the propeller of the current uptrend. Black Phoenix BPX�s token surged on Wednesday. Source: CoinGecko Nevertheless, Black Phoenix plans to list the BPX token on several exchanges, including Hotbit, Hitbtc, Coinex, Binance, and Coinbase Pro. Trading Volume Skyrockets 2,800,000% One key indicator of Black Phoenix�s recent success is the increase in trading volume. CoinGecko data shows a significant spike in trading volume for BPX on Wednesday, reaching 2,800,000%. At the same time, Black Phoenix�s market capitalization has risen to $3.8 billion, a significant increase from $29 million in hours. The fully diluted valuation (FDV) is a statistical representation of the maximum market capitalization an asset can achieve, assuming that all available tokens are in circulation. For Black Phoenix, the FDV currently stands at an impressive $10.4 billion. This valuation represents the potential growth and market cap of BPX if all 4 billion tokens were in circulation. Following the notable surge in all key metrics for BPX, the project�s team has made a bold prediction, stating that BPX will soon become one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the world.

    "content": "Analysts from leading international cross-border bank, Standard Chartered have made a bold prediction that Bitcoin could witness a significant rise to new all-time highs above $73,700. This projection, slightly higher than the cryptocurrency�s previous peak, comes with an unexpected and wholly ambitious timeline. Bitcoin Poised To Reach New All-Time Highs Geoff Kendrick, Head of EM FX Research, West and Crypto Research, Standard Chartered, has made a bullish prediction for Bitcoin, the world�s largest cryptocurrency. In an email to TheBlock, Kendrick stated that Bitcoin is poised to break out of its previous all-time high on March 14, 2024, to witness a massive surge to approximately $73,798. Related Reading Crypto Market Liquidations Top $330 Million In 24 Hours With Ethereum In The Lead 2 days ago The analyst has projected a rather grandiose timeline for this bullish rally, expecting Bitcoin to hit the forecasted price target by the weekend. Kendrick attributed this potential price increase to the recent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Earlier on May 21, data from Farside investors indicated that Spot Bitcoin ETFs had recorded their best inflow week in the last two months. The digital asset saw over $305.7 million in inflows, with BlackRock�s Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), amassing the largest inflows of $290 million. Cumulatively, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded inflows of more than $13 billion from its launch on January 11 to the present. This increased demand and influx of capital which had been a major contributor to Bitcoin�s previous rise to a new all-time high in March, could propel fresh surges for the cryptocurrency. Kendrick has also disclosed that the possible approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could have a significant impact on Bitcoin�s price dynamics. The analyst has doubled down on his previous price prediction which anticipates Bitcoin�s rise to $150,000 by the end of 2024 and a whopping $200,000 increase in 2025. BTC Price Analysis As of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $70,013, reflecting a slight decline of 1.39% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady bullish momentum over the past week, experiencing consistent price surges, which have led to a sharp increase of 12.86%.

This sentiment for a bullish breakout is shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who has asserted that Bitcoin is currently showing a strong potential for further gains, underscoring the cryptocurrency�s robust price potential and strong fundamentals.

Its ecosystem presents a roadmap unlike no other, gearing to change the narrative in the casino world. Unlike its traditional rivals, Rollblock offers a smooth sign-up process, prioritizing user privacy and convenience in today�s digital world. In addition, its incorporation of cryptocurrency as well as seamless onboarding process draws diverse users across the crypto market, especially with no need for KYC verification or extra downloads. Furthermore, Rollblock introduces a unique revenue-sharing model that could potentially change the dynamics in the GameFi market. While trying to repurchase $RBLK tokens from the open market, the Rollblock network sets aside up to 30% of its weekly revenue to achieve this. Furthermore, Rollblock�s token-burn feature ensures that 50% of repurchased tokens are removed from the market, while the other half goes to staking rewards. Meanwhile, the native RBLK token currently trades for $0.012 per token, which reflects 20% increase from an initial offering price of $0.01 as well as heightened buyer interes. As it awaits its listing on a major crypto exchange, market experts are touting Rollblock to soar to the top, making it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy this year. Solana Bulls Highly Optimistic With $200 Projection One of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the market, Solana (SOL) has proven time and again to be a formidable player in the crypto space. Notably, Solana is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to resolve scalability concerns in the crypto market by introducing proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism. Besides its unique features, Solana has also demonstrated exceptional strength in the broader DeFi market. In the last year, Solana has surged over 760%, demonstrating its resilience despite the bear market. Currently trading at a weekly price range between $146.8 and $178.6, SOL token has shown signs of recovery with analysts projecting a resurgence for the token. Furthermore, Solana network�s success can be partly attributed to emergence of meme coins on the Solana blockchain. With tokens like Dogwifhat and Bonk taking centerstage, there has been a growing interest in the Solana network as a whole. Moreso, while this has spurred optimism, analysts are projecting Solana to soar and reach the $200 mark very soon. With its current mass adoption and growing market cap, Solana maintains a solid spot among top Defi tokens in the crypto market. Can Rollblock Become As Successful As Solana in the Altcoin Market? Rollblock�s ascent in the crypto market has been quite commendable, with the token exploding into the scene without much hassle. This is a result of its innovative features and distinct roadmap which give it an edge over other new tokens. With its current trajectory, market experts are touting it to mirror and surpass some of the top DeFi tokens in the market.\n\n",

    "content": "The global crypto adoption rate remains unsatisfactory and efforts are on to bring more people into web3. In this session, we�re interviewing Herbert Sim, COO of the digital asset trading platform, Websea, where he shares his insights about web3 adoption. Q. Hello. Would you please introduce yourself and share your professional journey with our readers? Hi, I�m Herbert and it�s wonderful to be here. I�m currently the COO of Websea, a youth-focused web3 digital asset trading platform. Before Websea, I worked as the Global Operations Director at Huobi Global and Chief Marketing Officer at Cryptology Exchange. So I�ve been in operational management in the FinTech sector for a fairly long time. Most people know me as �The Bitcoin Man� for my work as an angel investor and advisor for crypto projects. The Bitcoin Man is now a venture capital fund where I continue to invest and incubate promising startups. I�m also the founder of Crypto Chain University (CCU), a non-profit institute and digital repository for blockchain research and policy-oriented work. CCU is a passion project and comes from my desire to make web3 accessible to people. I believe the web3 sector has much to do to bring decentralized protocols to the masses. So I continue to work hard to realize the vision of �onboarding the next billion� to crypto. Q. Why do you think the web3 industry hasn�t yet reached mass crypto adoption? What does the industry need to do to bring more people into web3? In my opinion, the biggest problem is the lack of easy-to-use, smooth, and efficient web3 protocols with an engaging user interface. We can�t expect newcomers to navigate complicated apps to store or use digital assets daily. So web2 users need a seamless transition to web3 protocols where they don�t require any technical knowledge to operate the apps. Moreover, web3 apps must integrate attractive features and financial incentives to appeal to first-time users. For instance, crypto exchanges function as the main gateway to enter web3 for investing and trading in crypto and NFTs. These exchanges serve as the primary circulation hubs for the digital asset economy to transact globally without any restrictions. However, most crypto exchanges have a difficult user interface that doesn�t appeal to new users. Thus we need more exchanges that can conveniently provide digital asset services and remain integrated with the wider web3 economy. Once we have engaging web3 protocols, people from diverse demographics will start joining the crypto world. Q. Who do you think will be the primary driver of crypto adoption in the next decade? Can you elaborate on the reasons? I think the digital asset economy is conducive for people of all age groups and across geographical borders. If you look at statistical reports, there has been an almost 200% growth in global crypto users with Asian and African countries dominating the Crypto Adoption Index. But once you probe further, you�ll see that young people are the main drivers in the crypto space and will continue to do so. A Coinbase report states that 31% of young people own crypto compared to just 12% of older people. Further, 38% of youth believe that crypto is the future of finance compared to 28% of the older generation. There are multiple reasons why Millennials and Gen Z prefer crypto assets. To begin with, they�re digital natives who organically grew up with the Internet. But other socio-economic factors are working as well. Millennials have faced student debts, rising housing costs, inflation, and the 2008 financial crisis. Thus, rather than trusting centralized banks or government-backed national currencies, they�re more open to alternative finance like crypto. The Great Wealth Transfer will happen over the next few decades where Millennials and Gen Z will inherit around $84 trillion. A Galaxy Research report states that $160-$225 billion would come into crypto markets from younger generations if the Wealth Transfer happened today. When the Transfer is complete by 2045, crypto can record a daily incremental buying pressure of around $20-$28 million. That is why I�m building Websea, a digital asset ecosystem that specifically focuses on young investors. Q. Tell us more about Websea. How do you intend to cater to a young audience with your platform? Websea is a digital asset trading platform exclusively customized for the global youth. Our platform offers a dual account system with centralized and decentralized asset custody models. We have an integrated AI system for risk mitigation, fraud prevention, predictive trading analytics, and strategy recommendations. The WBS token powers our Websea platform. WBS has a total supply of 300 million tokens with 60% allocated for community incentives. The rest is for long-term platform development with a multi-year lock-up period. We follow an X-To-Earn tokenomics model where users can play, trade, browse, stake, contribute, and create to earn tokens. To answer your second question, Websea offers gamified features for an engaging and entertaining trading experience for our young audience. We also have options like Boost to Bargain, Invitation Red Packet rewards, Lucky Box awards, and Group Boosts. These financial incentives help us consolidate our platform and organically expand our user base. Websea is also focussing on building a gaming ecosystem to cater to the youth and will incubate GameFi projects. Q. We�re currently going through a bull market where hype and speculation dominate crypto trading. However, the bear market brings a huge slump. So what do you think about this cycle and its impact on the crypto trading industry? How do you think the youth will shape this space in the coming years? I consider that the bull market hype brings new investors to the crypto industry. So there�s nothing fundamentally wrong with speculative trading during a bull run. Plus, the stock market also goes through cycles so it�s only natural for the crypto market to go through the same. Let me explain this with an example. The Runes hype has brought huge attention to Bitcoin and will provide an impetus to Bitcoin DeFi in the long run. However, as of April, two-thirds of the top 50 Runes are in the red, which means investors are not seeing any immediate profits. People usually blame young investors for having fun with memecoins and making the crypto space akin to gambling. But even Vitalik Buterin thinks such practices are not entirely bad. He recently said, �If people value having fun, and financialized games seem to at least sometimes provide that, then could there be a more positive-sum version�?� I�ll echo Buterin�s statement and say that young investors know what they�re doing and how they want to manage their finances. So even if they�re having fun with meme coins or investing seriously in BTC or ETH, they know the game. That is why I think the youth will drive global crypto adoption and make the web3 space more valuable and utility-driven in the future. Image: Websea Medium Blog\n\n",

    "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been on a hot streak in the past few days, with several large-cap assets posting significant gains in the past week. Most notably, the Bitcoin price bounced back from around $61,000 to above $67,000 for the first time in nearly a month. As expected, this latest price movement has sparked a lot of speculation and discussion around the premier cryptocurrency. Popular blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant has shared on-chain insights into the recent Bitcoin price rally and its future trajectory. How Did Bitcoin Price Reach $67,000? In a recent report, CryptoQuant revealed the catalyst and on-chain manifestations behind BTC�s latest rally to above $67,000. According to the analytics firm, the price of Bitcoin rode to its new highs on the back of the news of lower-than-expected inflation in the United States.

Indicators Suggest Upward Momentum Ahead 6 days ago The inflation data released on Wednesday, May 15 showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in April � lower than the expected 0.4%. This revelation suggested that inflation might be on a downward slope in the US, making risky assets like Bitcoin more attractive. ? #Bitcoin\u0027s price has rallied from $60K to around $66K, driven by lower-than-expected US inflation and reduced selling pressure. Let\u0027s look into the details ?? � CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 17, 2024 In its report, CryptoQuant revealed that there has been a decreased selling pressure in the BTC market, as short-term holders are selling at low or negative profits. Meanwhile, Bitcoin balances at over-the-counter (OTC) desks have steadied, implying that fewer coins are entering the open market. What�s more, the analytics platform highlighted a particular on-chain signal that might have predicted the recent Bitcoin price rally. According to CryptoQuant, BTC miners have been extremely underpaid over the past few weeks, which often correlates with price bottoms. The Catalysts For Sustained BTC Rally? CryptoQuant, in its report, identified potential catalysts for a continued rally for the Bitcoin price. According to the on-chain data company, demand from permanent holders and largest investors is on the rise but it needs to climb rapidly to push the price of BTC even higher. Related Reading Crypto Post-Mortem: Here�s How Pump.Fun Was Exploited For $2 Million 5 days ago Furthermore, the latest data shows that Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded funds) purchases have dwindled to nearly zero daily, while stablecoin liquidity growth is also on a decline. CryptoQuant noted that these two metrics need a jolt, which might be critical for a sustained Bitcoin rally. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price continues to hover around $67,000, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency is up by a significant 10% in the past week.

One analyst took to X amid this uptick, noting that whales holding over 1,000 BTC are not moving their coins to exchanges. Instead, they likely expect prices to spike higher in the coming days and weeks. Though movements over the weekend were muted, the extension earlier today is overly bullish for optimistic traders. As BTC prices edge, coin holders (and sometimes whales) usually take profits, especially if gains are shaky and not as strong. Whales Are Not Selling, More Gains Expected?

According to the analyst, the MVRV ratio for those who have held BTC for between 1 and 3 months has climbed above 66,500. This expansion means they have exited the �unrealized loss� zone, signaling a shift in sentiment among short-term holders. At spot rates and prices trading above $66,700, above the $66,500 level, HODLers are in the green and can exit for a profit or HODL. Bitcoin Finds Strong Support Above $60,000 It remains to be seen how prices will react in the short to medium term. However, another analyst notes that over 530,000 BTC was traded at $66,250. Accordingly, this line is turning out to be a strong, reliable support. If bulls soak in the selling pressure, the line at $66,250 can act as a reliable anchor for the next leg up toward an all-time high.

    "content": "The Bitcoin Halving event is now one month behind us, but the market is still waiting for solid signs of recovery. To attest to this is the fact that the Binance coin has seen a significant decrease in value, further adding fuel to the fire on the market. Right now it�s sitting at $569, which is a 5% decrease compared to last week, highlighting major underperformance compared to the global cryptocurrency market. However, you can still make profits in this bearish environment. Top market experts are saying that the future is in the meme coin market. More specifically in Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), and WienerAI ($WAI) projects. Let�s check out the details. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Binance Coin (BNB) Has Seen Significant Drops in the Past Week � These Hot New Presales Could Save the Day The forefront of the market has long been occupied by BNB, thanks to its close ties with Binance, the world�s largest crypto exchange. It used to be seen as one of the most stable coins, with minimal price fluctuations. However, recent times have seen a significant shift. Binance Coin experienced substantial drops over the past week, plummeting well below the $600 mark. One contributing factor to this sudden downturn is the recent series of major crypto-related arrests. Ontario�s ��Crypto King��, Aiden Pleterski, was arrested on fraud charges following an 18-month investigation. Authorities found evidence of money laundering using investor funds. Similarly, two US citizens were apprehended for a lightning-fast theft totaling over $25 million. The brothers Anton and James Peraire-Bueno, aided by corrupt IRS agents, allegedly engaged in money fraud and wire laundering. If found guilty, they could face up to 20 years in prison. Despite these setbacks, there are still profit opportunities, especially in the booming meme coin market. Analysts are pointing to new presales as the next big thing, with tokens like Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), WienerAI ($WAI), and Sealana ($SEAL) showing potential for x100 returns. Let�s see the details of each token below. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) Brings New Innovation to the Market as the First Multi-chain Token Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) stands out as the pioneer in multi-blockchain functionality among coins. Its groundbreaking technology seamlessly integrates across 6 major blockchains, a feat never seen before in the crypto realm. Inspired by the successful models of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Dogeverse adopts the beloved dog avatar concept, featuring a quirky space doge navigating the vast crypto landscapes. This character symbolizes the freedom and agility within the crypto space, effortlessly moving between blockchains. The presale phase of Dogeverse witnessed unprecedented success, raking in millions shortly after its ICO launch in April. As of now, the project has amassed over $15 million and is rapidly approaching its hard cap of $17 million, signaling the high demand and investor interest. One of Dogeverse�s strengths is its strong community support, boasting nearly 20,000 followers on X. This massive following is not surprising, given that 25% of the total 200 billion tokens are dedicated to marketing, ensuring widespread visibility and engagement. Investors opting to stake $DOGEVERSE tokens can enjoy various rewards and benefits, with annual percentage yields reaching up to 72% Currently priced at $0.00031 per coin, buying $DOGEVERSE tokens at this stage presents a favorable opportunity, especially considering the anticipated exponential surge in price post-listing. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Dogeverse Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Sealana ($SEAL) is the Future for Solana Based Meme Coins With a Familiar Mascot and Successful ICO Sealana ($SEAL) is a plump seal diving deep into the Solana Sea�s mysteries. He�s glued to his PC, growing larger by the day, fueled by chips and canned tuna. His obsession? Finding the best Solana meme coins, keeping his flippers busy. Inspired by South Park�s World of Warcraft episode, Sealana is the newest SOL meme coin with a �Send to Wallet� presale. Rumor has it that it�s from the same creators behind the viral SLERF token that blew up in March 2024. To get $SEAL, you can use the website widget or send SOL directly to the presale wallet. After the presale, you�ll get token airdrops. Right now, $SEAL is a steal at $0.022, but prices will rise during the presale. It�s smart to get in early. And if you�re sending tokens to Sealana�s wallet, use a DEX wallet to qualify for the airdrop. But what really sets Sealana apart is its community. Unlike other projects, $SEAL fans are active and engaged, sharing memes and insights. This lively atmosphere makes Sealana more than just a meme coin�it�s a community-driven adventure in the crypto world. In short, Sealana isn�t just riding the hype; it�s a symbol of community, innovation, and a bit of seal spirit. Whether you�re a crypto pro or just curious, consider joining Sealana�s journey and see where it takes you in the Solana Sea. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Sealana Now \u003c\u003c\u003c WienerAI ($WAI) is the Next Big Doge-Themed Token Aiming to Combine Crypto and AI WienerAI ($WAI) emerges as the next-gen doge-themed token, integrating cutting-edge AI technology into its framework. Currently, in its presale phase, WienerAI is set to undergo multiple stages. In the ongoing phase, investors can acquire 1 $WAI for $0.000707. This phase is swiftly approaching its conclusion, having already raised close to $2 million within just a month. With only $150,000 remaining to bridge the gap, the next phase promises significant price escalations. Staking is a pivotal aspect of WienerAI, offering generous rewards for token holders. While it�s expected that APYs will decrease as more users adopt the token, early investors stand to benefit from this advantageous opportunity. Down the road, WienerAI plans to integrate an AI bot into its platform, enhancing trade predictions and overall functionality. This forward-looking approach adds another layer of appeal for potential investors interested in the project�s long-term vision and innovation. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Wiener AI Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Conclusion The recent market dip of the famous Binance coin has left investors feeling uneasy about their future finances. However, many experts are optimistic that there are still big profits to be made, more notably in the meme coin market. If you want to jump on the opportunity early, top analysts recommend considering investments in Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), WienerAI ($WAI), and Sealana ($SEAL). Grab these tokens before prices skyrocket after the presale ends. Being among the first to invest could lead to significant gains as these tokens will surely gain traction in the market.\n\n",

    "content": "In an analysis shared via X, renowned crypto analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) has provided compelling evidence to support his assertion that the current Bitcoin bull run is far from over. Ted�s insights are based on four critical indicators related to traditional finance and crypto liquidity, each pointing to sustained growth in the near future. Here�s a breakdown of his analysis: #1 65-Month Liquidity Cycle Ted highlights the 65-month liquidity cycle, a historical pattern that marks the ebb and flow of liquidity in financial markets. According to his analysis, this cycle bottomed out in October 2023, signaling the beginning of a new expansion phase. Related Reading Most Important Bitcoin Indicator Nears Bullish Flip: $150,000 Soon? 1 week ago �We are now in the expansion phase, which is expected to peak in 2026,� Ted stated. This projection aligns with the anticipated easing by central banks in response to slowing economic data over the next 18 to 24 months. Historically, increased liquidity has been a precursor to bull markets in various asset classes, including Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. 65 month liquidity cycle | Source: @tedtalksmacro #2 M2 Money Supply The M2 money supply, which includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money, is another crucial indicator, if not the most important indicator of global liquidity. Ted notes that the rate of expansion in the M2 money supply is at its lowest since the 1990s. �There is plenty of room to the upside for easing liquidity conditions,� he explained. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies to stimulate economies, increased M2 growth could lead to more capital flowing into risk assets like Bitcoin. M2 money supply | Source: @tedtalksmacro #3 Crypto Liquidity While liquidity has returned to the crypto markets, particularly with the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ted points out that the velocity of inflows has not yet reached the levels seen at cycle tops. �The velocity of inflow has not yet seen a manic phase consistent with cycle tops,� he noted. Related Reading Tether Adds Fresh $1 Billion USDT To Supply � Bitcoin To Rally Again? 5 days ago This suggests that while interest and investment in Bitcoin are growing, the market has not yet reached the speculative frenzy that typically precedes a major correction. This phase of measured inflow can provide a more stable foundation for continued price increases. Crypto liquidity | Source: @tedtalksmacro #4 Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows The US based spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant inflows, with last week alone witnessing $950 million flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, the largest net inflow since March. Ted expects these inflows to increase as Bitcoin�s price rises and traditional finance investors regain confidence in the asset. �Expect these to only increase as price drifts higher and tradFi once again renew faith in the asset,� he stated. The growing acceptance and investment from institutional investors via ETFs are a strong bullish indicator for Bitcoin�s continued ascent. Spot Bitcoin ETF flows | Source: @tedtalksmacro Each of these factors points to a sustained and robust bull market for Bitcoin. Ted�s analysis, grounded in traditional financial indicators and crypto-specific data, provides a comprehensive outlook on the current and future state of the Bitcoin market. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies and institutional interest continues to grow, the conditions appear ripe for Bitcoin�s bull run to extend well into the coming years. At press time, BTC traded at $66,602. BTC price, 1-day chart | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Featured image created with DALL�E, chart from TradingView.com\n\n",

Lesson 2: Welcome to Remix This lesson introduces Remix, a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for developing Solidity smart contracts. In just a few hours, Patrick provides a step-by-step walkthrough of basic Solidity concepts such as types, functions, arrays, mappings, and structs. Additionally, he outlines core development concepts such as memory, storage, and calldata. By the end of this lesson, students will have set up their first smart contract and gained a basic understanding of Solidity and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)�a good first step for moving on to more complex and advanced contracts. Lesson 3: Remix Storage Factory Introduction In this lesson, students will begin experimenting with more advanced coding concepts in Remix. Most decentralized applications today are built as a collection of smart contracts that all work together to create a unified application. This lesson teaches you how to create multiple smart contracts that interact with each other in a logical and efficient way. It also introduces one of the most important concepts not only in Web3 development but in computer science at large: Inheritance. Lesson 4: Remix Fund Me Introduction In the fourth lesson of this free blockchain course, students learn how to create a crowdfunding application through two different smart contracts: FundMe.sol and PriceConverter.sol. By following along with and completing this demo application, students learn the basic keywords needed to securely send ether through a function and how to integrate Chainlink Price Feeds�the best-in-class price oracle solution for DeFi�to create price conversions. The lesson introduces both general and Solidity-specifc concepts such as loops, constructors, modifiers, immutability, constants, fallbacks, and interfaces. Lesson 5: AI Prompting, Asking Questions, and Getting Help This lesson focuses on enhancing your learning experience by providing tips for supercharging your learning experience, tips and tricks for setting up a GitHub and correctly formatting questions for the best results, and working with AI tools that can 10X learning and performance. Students will also be introduced to SpeedRunEthereum, a platform designed to assist in their learning journey. Lesson 6: Foundry Simple Storage Introduction Lesson six of this blockchain course for beginners moves students from Remix to Foundry�an Ethereum developer toolkit written in the Rust programming language. Patrick provides step-by-step instructions on the installation and setup, with separate instructions for MacOS, Linux, and Windows, and introduces Gitpod as a tool for local development. Once everything is set up, students will learn how to work with the VSCode editor and frameworks such as ThirdWeb and Alchemy, as well as tools for deploying to local chains. Lesson 7: Foundry Fund Me Introduction Lesson seven dives deeper into Foundry, with students learning how to test in a blockchain environment�including setup, debugging, and coverage. Specifically, Patrick outlines how to better manage gas in the context of storage and withdrawals for smart contracts, walks through the process of testing and debugging code, and introduces advanced deploy scripts, refactoring, and magic numbers. Additionally, students will learn the logistical process needed to push code to GitHub�one of the most basic skills needed to work as a professional developer alongside a larger team. Lesson 8: Html/Js Fund ME This lesson provides a quick full-stack/front-end tutorial for creating a blockchain application using HTML and JavaScript. Through this lesson, students will understand how the Metamask wallet works with their browser and get introduced to function selectors, which are crucial for interacting with smart contracts. Lesson 9: Foundry Smart Contract Raffle Introduction In lesson nine of this blockchain course, students will build a smart contract raffle demo using Foundry. They�ll learn how to set up a �Raffle.sol� contract that uses Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and Automation to generate a random number that�s used to pick the raffle winner. By building this smart contract application with the help of Patrick�s step-by-step tutorial, students will learn about custom errors, events, and block.timestamp, how to generate random numbers on-chain using Chainlink VRF, and how to automate smart contract functions using Chainlink Automation. Lesson 10: Foundry ERC20s This lesson covers everything ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment). By the end of this lesson, students will understand what an ERC, EIP, and ERC-20 are in a technical sense by following a series of steps. First, they�ll learn how to manually create an ERC-20 token, including the information needed to deeply understand the token standard. Then, students will learn how to use OpenZeppelin templates to create tokens (OpenZeppelin is a popular library for secure contract implementations) and then deploy their tokens on a testnet. Additionally, students will learn how to build AI tests, which can streamline the process of testing blockchain applications. Lesson 11: Foundry NFTs | MoodNFT This lesson introduces non-fungible tokens (NFTs), also known as the ERC-721 token standard. By following along with Patrick in this lesson, students will learn what an NFT is, how to create an NFT smart contract, how to use decentralized storage solutions such as IPFS or create NFT images using SVG, and how to directly encode function calls. Lesson 12: Foundry DeFi | Stablecoin Lesson 12 delves into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), from stablecoins and lending to auditing, fuzz testing, and more. In the pinnacle lesson of this tutorial, students will get an overview of the DeFi ecosystem, learn about one of the most prominent token types (stablecoins), and walk step-by-step through the code needed to build a decentralized stablecoin. This lesson also instructs students on how to work with DeFi protocols such as Aave�s lending protocol, which naturally covers concepts such as collateral, mints, price oracles, and liquidations. And because DeFi applications must make security their top priority, Patrick introduces one of the best testing techniques in Web3�fuzz testing. Lesson 13: Foundry Upgrades This lesson provides an introduction to upgradeable smart contracts, which are how Web3 developers securely add functionality to immutable contracts. Patrick summarizes the different types of upgrade techniques, introduces delegate calls, and compares universal upgradable smart contract proxies (UUPS) to transparent proxy patterns. Lesson 14: Foundry DAO/Governance In lesson 14, students will learn about another core Web3 concept�decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which are tools used for governing decentralized applications. Patrick not only explains what a DAO is at a fundamental level, but also provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up a DAO by creating a governance token and smart contract and running tests for your DAO smart contract to ensure correct functionality and execution. Lesson 15: Smart Contract Security and Auditing The final lesson of the 27-hour development tutorial focuses on smart contract security and auditing.

    "summary": "Discover three ways to increase transparency and mitigate risk around token bridges to help protect end users.\n\n",
    "content": "Driven by the demand for a more holistic Web3 user experience, cross-chain bridges are used to transfer digital assets from one blockchain network to another through wrapped tokens�one-to-one digital representations of tokens from another blockchain. They�re needed because blockchains are generally not interoperable by default. Wrapped tokens unlock cross-chain liquidity, but often require additional trust assumptions compared to assets native to a single blockchain. How cross-chain token bridges operate. The Complexities of Cross-Chain Bridge Security Cross-chain token bridges face an array of security challenges, from securing private keys to ensuring airtight smart contract code. Developers must take a comprehensive defense-in-depth approach to cross-chain bridge architecture, with independent layers of security at every step, from technical to social. Though cross-chain bridges are an integral part of Web3, they�ve historically been a target for malicious actors. Cross-chain bridge security shouldn�t just be reactive; it should proactively account for the possibilities of an attack or exploit and protect against the potential outcomes. The key question is: What do you do when a carefully laid security plan goes awry? Exploit and Attack Risks Regardless of how a bridge is compromised, there are often two immediate risks that come from bridge attacks and exploits. 1. Collateral on the source chain is withdrawn without correct ownership. User funds on the source blockchain are stolen and corresponding wrapped tokens are no longer fully backed. Because wrapped assets only hold value due to their cross-chain backing, stealing locked assets on the source blockchain effectively makes corresponding wrapped assets worthless. Digital assets locked on the source blockchain are stolen. 2. Cross-chain tokens on the destination chain are minted without sufficient collateral. Known as an �infinite mint� exploit, this is when an excess of wrapped tokens without sufficient reserves are minted, meaning they are no longer sufficiently collateralized. Infinite mint exploits lead to fractional reserve practices, and malicious actors can take advantage of this by either selling the wrapped token assets on a decentralized exchange or using the tokens as collateral on a lending market. How an infinite mint hack works. Ecosystem Risk A compromised cross-chain token bridge poses an immediate risk not only to bridge users but also to any project that directly integrates support for the wrapped token. Wrapped tokens are often used within DeFi protocols, and an exploit or hack can significantly impact operations and sometimes lead to protocol insolvency. For example, using wrapped tokens as collateral within a pooled DeFi lending market can put users at risk, even if they only lend or borrow network-native assets. If a wrapped token used as collateral is exploited, it can result in the loss of lender (or protocol) funds, leading to insolvencies that can not only impact users, but cause ripple effects across the wider ecosystem. How an exploiter can use an �infinite mint� attack to exploit a pooled DeFi lending market. As cross-chain token bridges and their wrapped tokens gain adoption, the ecosystem risk, if a bridge�s security is compromised, grows. How Chainlink Proof of Reserve Helps Supercharge Wrapped Token Transparency and Security Chainlink Proof of Reserve (PoR) provides smart contracts with the information needed to calculate the true collateralization of any cross-chain reserves backing wrapped tokens. Operated by a decentralized network of oracles, Chainlink Proof of Reserve verifies cross-chain collateral�acting as a data layer for a wrapped token bridge. Chainlink Proof of Reserve is a data layer for cross-chain bridges, enabling any user to independently verify collateral balances on the destination chain. Note: Chainlink PoR increases transparency into the reserves backing wrapped tokens, and can be used for additional safeguard features, but doesn�t prevent a cross-chain bridge from being drained due to an exploit. Rather, PoR can be used by bridges and dApps to help mitigate the impact of such events. There are 3 main benefits to using Chainlink Proof of Reserve for wrapped tokens. 1. Safeguard Smart Contract Functions A robust and decentralized reserve data feed gives bridge developers the tools to build automatic fail-safe measures that can halt the minting, redeeming, and burning of a wrapped token. For example, one way to help protect against infinite mint attacks is to use Chainlink Proof of Reserve data feeds to check if there is an equal or greater amount of reserves than wrapped tokens. If there aren�t, the minting of additional wrapped tokens is reverted. Because on-chain reserve data from Chainlink Proof of Reserve can help serve as a critical fail-safe in case of a bridge exploit or hack, it�s important that data feeds are secure, reliable, and accurate even in outlier circumstances. By leveraging a decentralized, Sybil-resistant network of nodes run by proven node operators, Chainlink Proof of Reserve provides best-in-class cross-chain reserve verification services, with updates reliably posted on-chain regardless of market or network conditions. By integrating Chainlink Proof of Reserve directly into a wrapped token smart contract, wrapped asset issuers can build in contingencies in case of an exploit or hack. 2. Enable Automatic DeFi Responses Robust on-chain proof of reserves surrounding wrapped tokens through Chainlink PoR enables DeFi developers to build in protections against potential bridge hacks or exploits. This helps mitigate DeFi contagion risk, and as more DeFi protocols implement these failsafe measures, ecosystem resiliency and anti-reflexivity will grow. For example, DeFi lending protocols could add circuit breakers that automatically pause lending pools using wrapped assets as collateral by reading data from Chainlink PoR data feeds. If there aren�t enough reserves locked on the source blockchain, the DeFi lending protocol can then automatically halt operations to reduce the severity of the event. A good proof of reserves solution for wrapped token assets makes it easy for DeFi developers to leverage the data for this exact reason. To lower the bar for implementations, reserve data feeds should be simple to implement, use a standardized solution, and be posted natively on-chain. As the industry-standard oracle solution for DeFi protocols, with over five billion data points delivered to blockchains, Chainlink Proof of Reserve enables DeFi developers to easily integrate reserve data into their dApp in just three steps. DeFi protocols integrating wrapped tokens can use Proof of Reserve to help protect against a cross-chain bridge hack or exploit at the protocol level. 3. Provide Users With Transparency Around Cross-Chain Collateral Automating data delivery on cross-chain reserves enables users to seamlessly verify the collateral backing of a wrapped token and quickly make informed decisions during outlier events�a key competitive edge for wrapped asset issuers looking to gain user adoption. Without proof of reserves, it can be difficult for users to verify on-chain that wrapped assets correspond on a one-to-one basis with assets on the source blockchain. One key consideration is that exploits or hacks can happen quickly. Reserve data feeds should be designed to update on-chain in near real-time to give users maximum transparency into the state of the cross-chain bridge, particularly when it�s most needed. That�s why Chainlink Proof of Reserve checks token reserves off-chain at regular intervals and updates the reserve data on-chain when it reaches a deviation threshold or heartbeat trigger, helping ensure real-time updates during unexpected events while saving on gas costs when reserves remain stable. Chainlink Proof of Reserve simplifies the reserve verification process by reliably delivering reserve data on the destination chain. Conclusion Bringing reserve data to blockchains provides crucial protection for cross-chain token bridges by enabling anyone to independently verify the collateral backing a wrapped token and projects to integrate automate failsafes in the event of a hack or exploit.

    "summary": "Learn how to automate your smart contracts using Chainlink Automation with this step-by-step guide and open up a huge range of use cases.\n\n",
    "content": "Smart contracts are not self-executing, meaning they require an externally owned account, oracle, or contract to trigger their own functions. This creates a problem for many dApps that require their smart contracts to execute at regular time intervals (e.g. every 24 hours), when predefined conditions are met (e.g. Ethereum hitting a specific price), or following a computation (e.g. a loan is calculated to be undercollateralized). In the past, developers would solve this problem by creating and maintaining their own centralized scripts to trigger their smart contracts, or trigger them manually. However, this effectively undermines the purpose of building a decentralized blockchain application, and opens up the possibility of downtime if the centralized script or manual triggering process fails. In this tutorial you will learn how to use Chainlink Automation to trigger smart contract execution in a reliable, automatic, and decentralized manner. Why Use Decentralized Automation To Trigger a Smart Contract? Chainlink Automation unlocks a new way to trigger smart contract execution in a decentralized manner, enabling developers to transform the way they build and maintain dApps. There are three main benefits to decentralized smart contact automation. Firstly, it is essential to remove any centralized points of failure in your operations. Chainlink Automation is powered by a decentralized network of nodes�the same hyper-reliable nodes that currently secure tens of billions in value across DeFi via Chainlink Data Feeds�removing centralized points of failure. Secondly, rather than investing time and resources in creating scripts for on-chain monitoring and triggering smart contract execution, developers can plug into Chainlink Automation�s optimized infrastructure by simply creating an Automation-compatible contract and registering it. This saves time, reduces the DevOps workload, and allows developers to focus on writing more great code. Lastly, by using Chainlink Automation, developers can enhance the security of their protocol. Developers no longer have to risk exposing their own private key when initiating transactions from centralized servers�the nodes on the Chainlink Automation Network will sign on-chain transactions. Get Started With Chainlink Automation You can automate your smart contracts with Chainlink Automation in two steps: Create and deploy an Automation-compatible contract Register the contract on the Chainlink Automation app to create an Upkeep After these steps have been completed, Chainlink Automation will perform the Upkeep job as specified without any further input. If you are new to Solidity, we recommend following some of the beginner tutorials before continuing. This tutorial is particularly comprehensive and useful. We will now show you how to make your contract Automation-compatible. If you prefer watching a video on the topic please watch our video tutorial. How To Create Automated Triggers for Smart Contracts To create an automated trigger for smart contract execution, you need to write an Automation-compatible smart contract. Automation-compatible contracts have a checkUpkeep function and a performUpkeep function with the required inputs and outputs expected by Chainlink Automation. To help prevent errors we will use the Automation-compatible interface before we specify what our check and perform functions should do. Importing the Automation-Compatible Interface Start by importing the KeeperCompatibleInterface into your contract. // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\n// KeeperCompatible.sol imports the functions from both ./KeeperBase.sol and\r\n// ./interfaces/KeeperCompatibleInterface.sol\r\n\r\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/KeeperCompatible.sol\"; There are two functions to this interface: The checkUpkeep Function Chainlink Automation uses a decentralized network to monitor the checkUpkeep function securely and cost-efficiently off-chain during every block and then initiates an on-chain transaction to execute the smart contract function when predefined conditions are met. function checkUpkeep(\r\n��bytes calldata checkData\r\n)\r\n��external\r\n��returns (\r\n����bool upkeepNeeded,\r\n����bytes memory performData\r\n��); The checkUpkeep function takes a bytes parameter named checkData that is set when you register your Upkeep on the Automation app. This value is optional and can be used in your logic to determine if checkUpkeep returns true. checkUpkeep returns a bool called upkeepNeeded. When true, this will call performUpkeep. It also returns performData in Bytes format (optional additional data) that the Automation Node should call performUpkeep with if Upkeep is needed. For more information, see the Developer Documentation. The performUpkeep Function If the off-chain simulation of your checkUpkeep confirms your predefined conditions are met (upkeepNeeded \u003d\u003d true from checkUpkeep), the Automation Node will broadcast a transaction to the blockchain executing the performUpkeep with performData as an input. function performUpkeep(\r\n��bytes calldata performData\r\n) external; A rotating node selection process prevents gas price auction wars between nodes and stabilizes costs of automating your contracts. Here is an example contract snippet from Chainlink Automation user Entropyfi where checkUpkeep checks whether the Entropyfi prediction game is due for settlement. /**\r\n* @dev chainlink keeper checkUpkeep function to constantly check whether we need function call\r\n**/\r\nfunction checkUpkeep(bytes calldata checkData) external override returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData) {\r\n     PoolStatus currState \u003d status.currState;\r\n     uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp \u003d status.lastUpdateTimestamp;\r\n     uint256 durationOfGame \u003d status.durationOfGame;\r\n     uint256 durationOfBidding \u003d status.durationOfBidding;\r\n\r\n     if (currState \u003d\u003d PoolStatus.Accepting \u0026\u0026 block.timestamp \u003e lastUpdateTimestamp.add(durationOfBidding)) {\r\n          upkeepNeeded \u003d true;\r\n     } else if (currState \u003d\u003d PoolStatus.Locked \u0026\u0026 block.timestamp \u003e lastUpdateTimestamp.add(durationOfGame)) {\r\n          upkeepNeeded \u003d true;\r\n     } else {\r\n          upkeepNeeded \u003d false;\r\n     }\r\n     performData \u003d checkData;\r\n} Chainlink Automation Nodes will constantly call the checkUpkeep function, and if the upkeepNeeded is evaluated to true, then the nodes will execute the performUpkeep function. /**\r\n* @dev once checkUpKeep been triggered, keeper will call performUpKeep\r\n**/\r\nfunction performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override {\r\n     PoolStatus currState \u003d status.currState;\r\n     uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp \u003d status.lastUpdateTimestamp;\r\n     uint256 durationOfGame \u003d status.durationOfGame;\r\n     uint256 durationOfBidding \u003d status.durationOfBidding;\r\n\r\n     if (currState \u003d\u003d PoolStatus.Accepting \u0026\u0026 block.timestamp \u003e lastUpdateTimestamp.add(durationOfBidding)) {\r\n          startGame();\r\n     }\r\n     if (currState \u003d\u003d PoolStatus.Locked \u0026\u0026 block.timestamp \u003e lastUpdateTimestamp.add(durationOfGame)) {\r\n          endGame();\r\n     }\r\n     performData;\r\n} Start With Some Sample Code Whether you are creating a new contract or already have a contract deployed that contains a function that needs to be automated there are guides to help you get started in the Chainlink Automation Developer Documentation.

Chainlink Automation can monitor the state of any on-chain or off-chain condition, such as the passage of time (e.g. did 24 hours pass?) or a computation (e.g. is the loan calculated to be undercollateralized?). Once a condition is met, Automation nodes submit a transaction on-chain to trigger the smart contract to execute. You can also start with a Chainlink Automation utility contract such as the EthBalanceMonitor contract or these examples. How to Register Your Contract as an Upkeep on the Network Once you have your Automation-compatible contract, head over to the Chainlink Automation app and click �Register new Upkeep�. For a detailed step-by-step guide on how to register, see the Chainlink Developer Documentation. Important note (for non-ETH chains): your Upkeep must be funded with ERC-677 LINK (not ERC-20, which is common across many token bridges). Use PegSwap to make your LINK tokens ERC-677 compatible. Once registered and approved, you can add additional funds and see all the details for your Upkeep on the Chainlink Automation app. Get Started Today Now that you know how easy it is to automate your smart contracts with Chainlink Automation, you can get started with integrating Chainlink Automation and unlock a huge range of use cases, such as DEX limit orders, cross-chain NFT minting, rebasing and rebalancing tokens, and much more.

    "content": "Blockchains are a radical new computing model where data and applications are secured not by centralized intermediaries but by a decentralized network of computers. Due to their permissionless nature, blockchains enable anyone to opt-in and begin independently verifying the integrity of computations, resulting in a checks and balances system between users and network operators. From the creation of new digital currencies with programmatic monetary policies (e.g. Bitcoin) to the execution of programmable trust-minimized applications (e.g. Ethereum), blockchains are rapidly entering the public consciousness as a new form of digital infrastructure, often referred to as Web3. However, while the overarching value proposition of blockchains is recognized by many, the nuances regarding the underlying trust model of blockchains are often misunderstood. This article will serve to explain how the trust model of blockchains differs from traditional computing by looking at the role of self-verifying full nodes, with particular reference to how they keep block producers (e.g. miners/validators) accountable and how decreasing the cost of verification is at the heart of blockchain scalability. The Limitations of Traditional Computing Models The computing model used by most applications today involves a client-server model where requests are sent to a centralized database server. The participants within the traditional computing model can be broken down into the following: Clients: End-users who generate requests, often via a personal device, which are sent to a centralized database server over the Internet via TCP/IP and await a response. Clients trust the database server to faithfully respond to requests. Database Servers: A remote computer, often in the form of a centralized cloud provider, that provides information or access to particular services. The backend database server is often a collection of computers which a traditional institution centrally manages. In the traditional computing model, users must trust an opaque centralized database. Often referred to as �Web2,� this computing model empowers developers to quickly launch and scale applications on-demand. Users are also provided with a seamless user experience due to low-latency and high-throughput computation facilitated by data centers. While applications hosted on centralized databases provide immense value to billions of users around the world, they carry certain limitations. Most notably, end-users have no way to verify that the computation involved in producing a response to a request is legitimate or that the database entries have not been manipulated over time. Such applications effectively operate in a black box, meaning users must fully trust that third-party intermediates will act in their best interests. The trust assumptions associated with centrally hosted applications can negatively impact users, who can experience financial censorship, social media deplatforming, leaks of their personal data, manipulative content selection algorithms, increased reconciliation costs, corrupted data and data loss, and an overall lack of accountability. The end result is a breakdown in societal trust and an increase in the cost of economic coordination. The Blockchain Computing Model Rather than trusting the good faith of centralized intermediaries, blockchains introduce trust-minimization and credible neutrality by using: Cryptography to authenticate data/asset ownership and validate transaction integrity; Decentralized consensus to establish the ordering of transactions and enforce the protocol�s rules; Financial incentives to ensure the immutability of the network�s ledger and its ongoing operation. Importantly, blockchains are open networks�anyone in the world can join as either an active contributor or a passive listener. This allows end-users to verify for themselves that any output produced by the network is valid and that ledger entries have not been tampered with. The transparency of blockchains also mitigates risks around opacity, eliminating information asymmetry and ensuring information regarding risk exposure is available to all participants. In the blockchain computing model, end-users can opt-in to join the network and verify the computations being performed. The Different Roles of Blockchain Participants To ensure the proper operation of a blockchain, there are various (often overlapping) categories of network participants that each play a crucial role. Block Producers (BPs): Entities responsible for ordering and packaging transactions into discrete data structures called blocks which are then proposed to the network to validate. If two valid blocks are produced at the same block height, BPs are responsible for determining which version of the chain is canonical (e.g. longest chain rule). A consensus algorithm is used to determine which BP is responsible for generating the next block in the chain of blocks, with Proof of Work (miners) and Proof of Stake (validators) being the two most popular models. Full Nodes: The heart of a blockchain network. Full nodes download and self-verify each block proposed by BPs. If the block is found to be valid (i.e. protocol rules have been followed), then the block is added to the full node�s personal copy of the ledger and state changes are applied. Any invalid blocks not in line with the protocol�s rules are ignored and consequently discarded without any state changes occurring. Archive Nodes: Entities that store all of the same information as full nodes but also compute and store previous states of a blockchain. Archive nodes are useful for querying arbitrary historical data, such as a user�s account balance at a specific block height in the past. Note that a full node can be converted into an archive node at any time without having to download any extra information from the network. Archive nodes typically have high hardware requirements and are commonly run by service providers (e.g. block explorers). Light Clients: A limited form of a full node where only the headers (i.e. small unique cryptographic fingerprints) of blocks are downloaded. Light clients can verify a transaction was included within a block, but because they do not download or execute all transactions within blocks, they implicitly trust that the majority of block producers are honest. Light clients, also known as Simple Payment Verification (SPV) clients, were first described in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. RPC Providers: Full nodes that facilitate read/write access to a blockchain that other network participants connect to. RPC (Remote Procedure Call) nodes are often used by those who do not or cannot run their own full node or light client, significantly reducing the friction of accessing a blockchain. Any user connected to an RPC provider implicitly trusts the honesty of the provider as no self-verification work is done. End-users: The average user who wants to make transactions on a blockchain network. This category can include participants who run a full node or light client, as well as those connected to an RPC provider. Blockchains exist to serve the end-users, otherwise there is no other reason for the network to exist. While each of these network participants plays a key role in blockchain ecosystems, full nodes operate at the heart of a blockchain network as they are the entities responsible for maintaining full replicas of the network�s ledger. Other network participants, such as block producers and light clients, connect to full nodes to stay informed on the state of the network. The resulting network topography is illustrated below. The topography of a blockchain network, where light clients and BPs are connected to full nodes. The Limited Powers of Block Producers A common misconception about blockchains is that since block producers are responsible for generating new blocks containing transactions, then they must unilaterally control a blockchain. Put another way, the belief is that if a majority of BPs are corrupted/colluding (commonly known as a 51% attack), then the network is wholly compromised and everything of value can be irrevocably destroyed. In reality, BPs have a limited scope of power, where only specific types of malicious activity can take place. What block producers can do: Censor Transactions: Individual BPs determine which transactions are included in blocks they create, allowing them to selectively ignore specific transactions. While colluding BPs can prevent transactions from being included in blocks they create, there only needs to be one honest BP in order for a transaction to be included within a valid block. Rewrite the Chain: If the majority of BPs collude (e.g. a 51% attack), then previously created valid blocks can be forked out of the network through a process called block reorganization (reorg), where a new chain of blocks becomes the canonical chain. Note that some blockchains have a notion of �economic finality� via a checkpoint system, with reorgs of blocks older than the checkpoint resulting in a chain halt which requires resolution via social consensus. A block reorg reverts previously accepted valid blocks with a new set of valid blocks. What block producers cannot do: Change the Protocol�s Rules: BPs cannot arbitrarily change the protocol�s rules such as adding/removing functionalities (e.g. opcodes), increasing/decreasing the maximum allowed block size or block time interval, or increasing/decreasing the block rewards issued for producing blocks. Steal User Funds: BPs cannot spend coins/tokens from addresses for which they do not have the private key, as the cryptographic signatures of such transactions would be invalid. Note that while chain reorgs can lead to double-spend attacks, this involves simply removing a transaction from the chain�s ledger that was signed by the private key holder, not falsifying a transaction signature. To understand why the power of BPs is inherently limited, it is important to understand the relationship between BPs and self-verifying full nodes. How Full Nodes Keep Block Producers Accountable While BPs ensure the liveness of a blockchain by proposing new blocks, they do not determine the validity of blocks on behalf of the network. Rather, it is the role of full nodes�which store a personal copy of the blockchain�s ledger�to independently validate each block and execute all the transactions contained within to determine whether the protocol�s rules are being followed. The result is a checks and balances system where full nodes hold BPs accountable by only accepting valid blocks and ignoring blocks that do not conform to the protocol rules. As such, BPs are economically incentivized to only produce valid blocks, as otherwise they would waste economic resources by producing invalid blocks and forfeit any block reward and transaction fees they could have earned. Even if other BPs build valid blocks on top of an invalid block, these blocks will all be ignored by full nodes, resulting in such BPs effectively forking themselves off the network. Full nodes are operated by key economic actors within a blockchain�s ecosystem, including cryptocurrency exchanges, stablecoin issuers, oracles, layer-2 validators, RPC providers, custody wallet providers, large crypto asset holders, and average users alike. By self-verifying a blockchain�s ledger, these key economic actors cannot be tricked into accepting invalid blocks. Full nodes do not need to coordinate/communicate with each other to determine if a block is valid either. Rather, by following the protocol�s rules when checking blocks, they will all arrive at the same conclusion regarding block validity. Invalid blocks are rejected by full nodes which continue to follow the valid chain of blocks. With many blockchains, the protocol rules are determined by the community off-chain in a process known as social consensus. This typically involves a formalized process (e.g. Ethereum Improvement Proposals or EIPs), where the community debates the merits of any protocol rule change on various social channels. Once rough off-chain consensus is achieved, blockchain core developers write a new version of the blockchain software client, which implements these changes. Full nodes and BPs can then choose whether or not to run this new software to upgrade the network via a hard fork (non-backward-compatible change) or a soft fork (backward-compatible change). If a hard fork upgrade is contentious, then the network may experience a chain split where two different versions of a blockchain are created and individually maintained. Once a split occurs, each blockchain will have a shared history from the genesis block up to the specific block height at which the split occurred. This was seen with the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash hard fork in 2017, when differences arose on how to scale transaction throughput. It was also seen in the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic hard fork in 2016, when differences arose on how to handle The DAO hack. Bitcoin Cash was a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that arose around differences in how to scale transaction throughput. (source) In contrast to off-chain consensus, other blockchains have chosen to handle upgrades via on-chain governance, with a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governed by token-holders determining protocol rule changes. Either method of facilitating protocol upgrades presents its own unique benefits and challenges, and the method used depends on the needs of the community. Low Hardware Requirements for Full Nodes If the hardware requirements for operating a full node are too high (e.g. non-consumer hardware is required), then fewer entities will be capable of or willing to run a full node, instead, relying on centralized solutions to read/write to the blockchain. This can result in a blockchain network becoming more vulnerable to exploitation from BPs. To support a healthy network of full nodes, many blockchains purposely limit the transaction throughput of the network to that of the lowest spec computer that the community desires to self-verify the ledger. Low hardware requirements not only help those who wish to run a full node during normal operations, but also make it easier to spin up a new self-verifying full node if the blockchain is actively being attacked by a colluding group of BPs. The exact hardware requirements necessary to stay fully synchronized to the network vary from blockchain to blockchain, however, a common target goal is average consumer hardware. An example of a Bitcoin full node running on a Raspberry Pi, a low-spec microcomputer. (source) The following logic describes how low hardware requirements lead to the core value proposition of blockchains: Low hardware requirements ? low cost to verify blocks ? more entities can run full nodes ? stronger resistance to BP attacks ? increased network security ? superior credible neutrality ? increased adoption While the minimum hardware requirements capable of running a full node are not explicitly defined in the rules of a blockchain protocol (improvements in hardware/software efficiency is perpetually occurring), the transaction throughput rules of a blockchain (commonly determined by the size and frequency of blocks) are tuned to target a specific range of device specifications. Although targeting average consumer hardware is a common approach, some blockchains opt to target beefier server-grade hardware as the minimum hardware requirements for verification in order to increase transaction throughput. This comes with the acknowledgment that while fewer entities may be able to self-verify the ledger using self-hosted equipment, a sufficient number of key economic actors may still have the resources necessary to run a full node. Reducing the Costs of Blockchain Verification Everyone in the world running their own full node to self-verify a blockchain is an idealistic goal. However, in practice, the time and resources required to spin up a full node may introduce too much friction for many end-users. As blockchains become more widely adopted, users familiar with trusting centralized service providers may find the process of setting up a full node too cumbersome, and would rather be able to immediately start interacting with on-chain applications. As a result, most end-users of widely used blockchains today do not run their own full node, but rather connect to and implicitly trust RPC providers to relay transactions to the network and inform them on the current state of a blockchain. Such users may not enjoy the full self-verification benefits of blockchains and the security of the network is not as strong as it could be, however, it is still an order of magnitude improvement in trust-minimization over traditional computing models. Many end-users today do not run a full node but rather connect to and trust an RPC provider. (source) A middle-ground solution to this problem could entail the integration of light clients into blockchain wallets. While this would be an improvement over the status quo by reducing trust in RPC providers, light clients still implicitly trust that the majority of BPs are producing valid blocks and that all of the transaction data within a block has been made publicly available. In order for light clients to verify the work of BPs without simply downloading and executing the entire block (i.e. running a full node), technical improvements in light client implementations can increase their trust-minimization properties, resulting in what can be considered �trust-minimized light clients�. These technical improvements can include: Fraud Proofs: A cryptographic proof generated by full nodes that can be sent to light clients to prove that a block is invalid and violates the protocol�s rules without the light client needing to re-execute the entire block. Validity Proofs: An alternative to fraud proofs where a zero-knowledge proof is generated, allowing block producers to directly prove to light clients that blocks are valid and follow the protocol�s rules. Data Availability Sampling (DAS): A probabilistic sampling technique that verifies that all of the data in a block has been made available to the network without light clients needing to download the entire block. Trust-minimized light clients verify the work of block producers without downloading or executing an entire block. (source) As additional trust-minimization techniques are created and deployed successfully in production, the cost and friction of verifying the work of block producers without downloading and executing entire blocks improve, leading to more secure blockchain networks. Notably, the methods of creating trust-minimized light clients can even enable more scalable blockchain networks to emerge. Scaling Blockchains While Retaining Self-Verification Scaling a blockchain is commonly thought of as being equivalent to increasing transaction throughput. However, a more holistic interpretation would be increasing transaction throughput while maintaining a low verification cost. Thanks to the properties of trust-minimized light clients, the throughput of a blockchain network can be increased (e.g. increasing block size and/or block interval time) yet still retain the low verification costs required to keep BPs accountable. Furthermore, layer-2 scaling solutions such as rollups leverage similar techniques as trust-minimized light clients by using cryptographic proofs to prove transaction validity without the blockchain network needing to execute every transaction. In this case, the blockchain operates an enshrined trust-minimized light client for the layer-2 rollup. Combined with transaction batching and storage of transaction data on-chain for data availability, transaction throughput can be increased by multiple orders of magnitude with minimal to no additional verification costs imposed on the underlying blockchain. Layer-2 rollups use a blockchain as an enshrined trust-minimized light client to increase transaction throughput. (source) Conclusion Blockchain are highly secure, credibly neutral, and transparent append-only ledgers that offer a new paradigm for computing. By incorporating a checks and balances system between block producers and full nodes, a blockchain can serve the needs of its community and evolve over time while also remaining resistant to manipulation. While more work needs to be done to lower verification costs, blockchains in their current state still offer an order of magnitude increase in trust-minimization over traditional computing models. � The opinions expressed within this post are solely the author�s and do not reflect the opinions and beliefs of the Chainlink Foundation or Chainlink Labs.

    "content": "Fundamentally, contracts define the terms and obligations for an exchange of value between two or more independent parties. Historically, a centralized arbitrator is usually required to verify if those terms and conditions are met. However, thanks to the advent of blockchain technology and smart contract applications, we can now replace centralized arbitrators with decentralized infrastructure, reducing counterparty risk and improving operational efficiency. However, due to the consensus mechanisms of blockchains, smart contracts have no built-in capabilities for interacting with external resources like data providers and API services as a means of verifying the outcome of real-world events happening outside the blockchain. This creates what is known as the blockchain oracle problem and represents one of the greatest limitations to representing everyday contracts on the blockchain. To overcome this lack of connectivity, hybrid smart contracts use oracles as middleware to retrieve external data inputs, push data outputs to external systems, and perform scalable off-chain computations. Not only do oracles serve as a two-way bridge between smart contracts and the outside world, but they also provide a security framework for protecting against any single point of failure such as data manipulation and downtime. The Chainlink Network connects smart contracts to off-chain data and events Chainlink is the most widely used decentralized oracle network, currently securing tens of billions in USD value for live applications across numerous blockchains and use cases. Chainlink is not a single oracle network but an ecosystem consisting of numerous decentralized oracle networks running in parallel. Each oracle network can provide a multitude of oracle services without cross dependencies on other oracle networks, some of which include: Decentralized Price Feeds that can be integrated in any DeFi application to obtain access to a high-quality, tamper-resistant, and fresh source of financial market data on a wide range of assets with full market coverage. A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) providing NFTs and on-chain gaming applications a provably fair and secure Random Number Generator (RNG) purpose-built for smart contract applications. Proof of Reserve (PoR) enabling smart contracts to audit the true collateralization of any on-chain asset backed by off-chain reserves such as fiat-backed stablecoins, cross-chain tokens, tokenized assets, and more. Automation providing dApp developers a reliable, decentralized, and cost-efficient transaction execution service for triggering smart contract functions and performing contract maintenance by leveraging off-chain computation. Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is an open-source standard for the multi-chain ecosystem, enabling cross-chain applications that can send messages and transfer tokens with commands across multiple blockchains. Modular External Adapters for connecting to any off-chain resource including premium data providers, authenticated web APIs, IoT sensors, bank payments, enterprise backends, other blockchain networks, and more. Off-Chain Computation such as Fair Sequencing Services for transaction ordering, DECO for privacy-preserving attestations of TLS web session data, Arbitrum Rollups for scalable off-chain Solidity computation, and more. Chainlink is a heterogeneous oracle network consisting of many oracle network models Ultimately, Chainlink provides the necessary developer tools required to construct any type of oracle network, such as using multiple data sources, multiple oracle nodes, various aggregation methods, payment penalties, reputation services, and visualization tools. This allows for a wide range of use cases to be developed, tested, and pushed into production. Access to external data opens up a whole new wave of functionality for smart contracts. To inspire you with the limitless potential of universally connected smart contracts, we put together a list of 77+ ways to use the Chainlink Network. If any of these ideas resonate with you or if you want to learn more, find us on Discord or Github, and check out our documentation to begin building universally connected smart contracts today. Decentralized Finance Money is the common medium used today to value and exchange assets. Financial products provide different vehicles in which people can maximize the value of their money via different strategies like hedging, speculating, earning interest, collateralizing loans, and more. However, traditional finance is often gated, wherein well-capitalized entities have disproportionate control over the issuance of money and the creation/offering and settlement of financial products. The result is a lack of universal accessibility to certain financial products and the introduction of counterparty risk, where the larger entity has more influence on whether the financial product is fairly honored according to the pre-agreed upon terms. Blockchains and smart contracts bring deterministic execution to financial products, eliminate moats around financial product creation, and provide tamper-proof monetary policy for on-chain assets. Chainlink oracles play a critical role in creating advanced smart contracts representing financial products and monetary instruments, particularly those that execute based on market data like FX rates, interest rates, asset prices, indices, and more. Money Markets Blockchain-based money markets are crucial financial infrastructure that use smart contracts to connect lenders, who wish to earn yield on their assets, with borrowers, who wish to gain access to working capital. They allow users to increase the utility of their crypto holdings and participate in both the supply side and the demand side. However, to ensure the solvency of the platform, price feeds are required to track the valuation of assets used on the platform as a means of ensuring loans are issued at fair market prices and liquidations automatically occur on undercollateralized loans. Aave, Compound, and Liquity are examples of on-chain money markets protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to fetch market data for dozens of different on-chain cryptocurrencies. With this real-time pricing data, these lending/borrowing protocols can calculate the valuation of each user�s collateral and debt in order to determine when liquidations should be initiated. This ensures the money market protocols are always sufficiently collateralized, protecting tens of billions of USD value in user deposits. Aave uses Chainlink Price Feeds to ensure proper collateralization Decentralized Stablecoins Stablecoins are on-chain tokens that are pegged 1:1 to fiat currency, commonly the US dollar. They provide users with the ability to hold a non-volatile cryptocurrency. While centralized stablecoins are backed by fiat in an off-chain bank account, decentralized stablecoins are commonly overcollateralized by on-chain cryptocurrencies and require price data to maintain full collateralization (e.g. a user�s collateral is worth over 150% the value of their loan). DeFiDollar is an example of a decentralized meta-stablecoin (a stablecoin backed by multiple stablecoins) that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to track the price of the underlying assets including sUSD, USDT, DAI, and USDC. In the event that one or multiple of these tokens deviate from their 1:1 USD peg, thus causing DUSD to also lose its peg, a rebalance is triggered between the four reserves in order to preserve the dollar parity of DUSD. DeFiDollar uses Chainlink Price Feeds for valuation data on the stablecoins backing DUSD Algorithmic Stablecoins Similar to centralized stablecoins collateralized by dollars in a bank account or decentralized stablecoins overcollateralized by on-chain cryptocurrency, algorithmic stablecoins aim to maintain a peg equivalent to another currency like USD. However, unlike other implementations, algorithmic stablecoins maintain their peg using automated rewards and penalties to drive the price towards the peg, often by burning the stablecoin when under its peg (deflation) and minting more stablecoins when over its peg (inflation). Fei Protocol is an example of an algorithmic stablecoin that uses Chainlink Price Feeds as the reference to set the protocol-controlled value bonding curve for the FEI/ETH liquidity pool on Uniswap to stabilize the peg of the FEI token. Through the market-wide pricing provided by the ETH/USD Price Feed, Fei Protocol can ensure the proper exchange rate is offered by the bonding curve. How the Fei Protocol uses Chainlink Price Feeds to stabilize the peg of its algorithmic stablecoin FEI Futures Futures are financial instruments that �obligate� traders to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Commonly used for hedging and leveraged exposure, futures smart contracts require users to collateralize their long or short position. Price feeds are used to determine whether or not liquidations should occur, ensuring each contract is fully collateralized at all times. Lyra and MCDEX are examples of on-chain financial applications that utilize Chainlink Price Feeds in order to power Perpetual Contracts, which is a Futures contract without expiry. By using Chainlink oracles, these protocols are able to ensure the solvency of their platform by having access to real-time price data for both determining when liquidations should occur and dynamically setting the funding rate to maintain net neutral exposure. Lyra uses the LINK/USD Price Feed to power the on-chain LINK-USD Perpetual Contract Options Similar to futures contracts, options are a type of financial derivative that grant traders the �option� to buy or sell a certain amount of a particular asset by a future date if they so choose. In the off-chain world, centralized entities most frequently underwrite the contracts, but on the blockchain, decentralized peer-to-peer options are possible. Opyn and Thales are examples of options protocols that use Chainlink Price Feeds to calculate the valuation of crypto assets, enabling users to mint, trade, and settle options contracts. Additionally, Chainlink oracle nodes like dxFeed provide Implied Volatility (IV) data on various crypto assets, granting contract creators the ability to calculate an option�s contract premium in a reliable and tamper-resistant manner. Opyn uses Chainlink Price Feeds to settle options contracts Synthetic Assets Synthetic assets are a category of financial instruments that provide traders price exposure to specific assets, such as indices or commodities, without requiring ownership of the physical asset itself. Smart contract-based synthetic assets allow traders to create advanced non-custodial trading strategies and gain exposure to traditional assets that do not exist on the blockchain. Synthetix is an example of a protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to enable the minting of various �synths� that allow traders to gain on-chain exposure to assets like cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, commodities, indices, equities, and more. Through a peer-to-contract trading model, users are able to swap between these synthetic tokens with zero slippage using Chainlink Price Feeds to access the current value of the underlying assets. Synthetix uses Chainlink Price Feeds as the target peg for numerous synthetic assets Credit Default Swaps Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are financial agreements that allow lenders to hedge against the possible occurrence of a default (lack of payment) from a borrower. If the borrower goes into default, the party who issued and sold the Credit Default Swap reimburses the lender for the outstanding funds not paid by the borrower. Opium.Exchange is an example of an on-chain protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to settle various financial instrument products. One of these products includes a Credit Default Swap on the centralized stablecoin USDT Tether, allowing traders to hedge against Tether deviating and falling below its $1 peg. Bonds Bonds are a financial agreement that enables the raising of short-term capital by issuing debt to be paid back at a later date. Traditional bond contracts can be replicated as an automated smart contract through the use of Chainlink oracles, which provide the data required for settlement such as interest rates, debt scores, fiat payments, and more. Chainlink has already demonstrated such capability with a POC with SWIFT, where oracles were used to aggregate interest rates from five major banks, fetch debt score data from S\u0026P, and generate an interest payment in the form of an ISO20022 SWIFT payment message. As a multi-trillion dollar industry, bringing bonds onto the blockchain can greatly reduce counterparty risk and lower operational costs across the board. A smart contract bond using Chainlink oracles and SWIFT�s ISO20022 standard Tokenized Portfolio Management A unique use case for smart contracts is non-custodial �smart portfolios� that automatically rebalance user portfolios by executing trades on their behalf based on preset conditions. This provides users with advanced financial products that programmatically manage investments based on the current market-wide price of specific assets and tokens. These trading strategies can be tokenized, allowing users to transfer and use these tokens within other smart contract applications. Tokensets is one such example of a protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to generate various �Sets,� tokenized positions that execute trades on the behalf of users. These Sets are based on Technical Analysis (TA) metrics such as the RSI or moving averages, designed to catch key price action trends. Additionally, users can use their Set tokens as collateral within other protocols, such as the Aave money market, to gain additional capital efficiency. Proof of On-Chain Reserve Wrapped cross-chain assets�cryptocurrencies/tokens native to one blockchain that are locked into a contract and then �unlocked� on another blockchain�are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to increase the collateral types available within the DeFi ecosystem. However, in order to ensure the integrity of DeFi applications supporting wrapped asset deposits, Proof of Reserve reference contracts can be used to supply data regarding the true collateralization of these on-chain assets. Two protocols using Chainlink to power Proof of Reserve reference feeds include BitGo�s WBTC and Ren Protocol�s renBTC, representing a large majority of the wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum and representing billions in USD value. These Proof of Reserve reference feeds provide DeFi protocols with the data they need to autonomously verify collateral reserves and swiftly protect user funds during an undercollateralization event. Proof of Reserve reference feeds can also be used to track the collateralization of assets beyond cross-chain tokens including stablecoins and real-world commodities, further increasing the collateral available within DeFi. Chainlink Proof of Reserve provides smart contracts proof of the Bitcoin collateral backing BitGo�s Wrapped BTC (WBTC) Proof of Off-Chain Reserve Bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain provides a large potential to expand the economic activity of DeFi, as seen with the adoption of fiat-backed stablecoins. However, this requires the underlying collateral to be held by a central custodian, disconnecting the on-chain tokenized representation from the actual off-chain asset itself. Through Chainlink Proof of Reserve, smart contacts are able to autonomously audit the collateralization of real-world asset-backed tokens, protecting users during black swan events. Examples of this are the Paxos Proof of Reserve for PAX and PAXG as well as the TrustToken Proof of Reserve for TUSD. The latter provides DeFi applications with data regarding the true amount of US dollars backing the stablecoin TUSD held by TrustToken�s off-chain escrowed bank accounts as reviewed by Armanino, an independent top-25 auditing firm in the United States. This collateralization data can be checked against the total amount of circulating TUSD tokens on various blockchains, as reported by the complementary TUSD Proof of Supply feed, to determine the collateralization of TrustToken�s tokenized USD. TrustToken uses Chainlink Proof of Reserve to provide smart contracts proof of the off-chain fiat reserves backing the TUSD stablecoin Automated Asset Management Smart contracts can be used to automatically execute trading strategies at predetermined intervals. However, a range of variables can influence the profitability of those strategies, specifically network gas costs. Thus, traders using automated systems need reliable data from oracles in order to ensure that their trades will be consistently profitable. Pickle Finance is using Chainlink Automation in its Pickle Jars product to help automatically manage capital-efficient LP positions across Uniswap v3. By automatically rebalancing users� LP positions, Chainlink Automation helps ensure the positions remain in range and collect maximum LP fees�helping maximize returns for users. Revenue Sharing As an increasing number of DeFi products launch with DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance, there becomes more of a need for developers and community members to distribute the revenue generated by a DeFi protocol in a decentralized and real-time manner. Through the usage of Chainlink oracles, DAOs can distribute crypto revenues proportionally according to various metrics, such as staked coins, governance participation, developer activity, or any customized set of requirements. Synthetix is one example of a DeFi protocol that will use Chainlink Automation to trigger the distribution of exchange fees and staking rewards each week to users. Chainlink Automation will monitor the smart contract�s state off-chain and autonomously call the fee distribution function in the protocol�s feePools smart contract after the fee period duration has ended. Synthetix will use Chainlink Automation to trigger the distribution of exchange fees and staking rewards to users Yield Farming Yield Farming is a new financial primitive within the DeFi ecosystem that is used to bootstrap liquidity and facilitate the fair distribution of a protocol�s governance tokens. In most yield farming applications, users who provide liquidity to a protocol are granted a reward in the form of its native governance token, serving as a growth subsidy. Two protocols using Chainlink oracles in their yield farming mechanisms are Plasm and StrongBlock. Plasm uses Chainlink price oracles to help determine the amount of value users have locked into the protocol and then distributes rewards accordingly, while StrongBlock calculates the USD value locked in Community pools once every 24 hours. StrongBlock uses Chainlink oracles to calculate staking rewards based on miner reliability Yield optimizing protocols automatically harvest and compound yield for their users. Users deposit tokens into a vault that automatically harvests yield at critical points to maximize compounding returns. However, as smart contracts cannot execute their own functions, yield optimizers need an external entity to trigger an on-chain transaction. Instead of depending on unreliable public bounties or centralized bots with a single point of failure to automate transactions, many yield optimizers use a trust-minimized solution. Chainlink Automation enables developers to trigger smart contracts in a highly reliable, cost-efficient, and decentralized manner, and has already powered tens of thousands of automated transactions across Web3. Developers can set them to autocompound yield at regular periods or build advanced optimization strategies that only execute when it�s profitable to do so. For example, the yield optimizer Pickle Finance is using Chainlink Automation to help yield aggregators build more advanced, fully automated vault strategies. With Chainlink Automation, Pickle Finance is able to increase rewards for depositors without relying on manual intervention or introducing a single point of failure would make its platform vulnerable to manipulation and technical failures. See how you can get started with Chainlink Automation or explore the docs. Leveraged Yield Farming Users can increase their yield and capital efficiency by using leveraged yield farming protocols that lend depositors capital through protocol-controlled undercollateralized loans. With these positions, borrowers can maximize the value of their assets through various yield farming strategies while lenders earn a passive income from borrowers who want to amplify their farming positions. This results in an application-specific money market specially focused around the activity of yield farming. Alpaca Finance is one example of a protocol using Chainlink Price Feeds to enable users to leverage up their positions on PancakeSwap and WaultSwap by borrowing capital to increase their positions. Financial market data from Price Feeds is used to calculate proper collateralization ratios during loan issuance and liquidate positions to ensure the long-term solvency of the protocol, even during market volatility in the valuation of the collateral deposited by borrowers. Alpaca Finance uses Chainlink Price Feeds during the loan issuance and liquidation processes Cross-Chain Yield Farming As the DeFi ecosystem continues to expand across a number of blockchain networks, the opportunity for generating yield from existing protocols like Aave will fractionalize across disconnected environments. In order to overcome this issue, a cross-chain token bridge is required to facilitate the transfer of user funds across networks. However, existing cross-chain solutions are vulnerable to exploitation, with hundreds of millions of dollars already having been siphoned from such protocols. The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), a secure open-source standard for transferring messages and tokens across blockchain networks, overcomes these issues and will provide developers with the tamper-resistant infrastructure required to create multi-chain yield earning platforms. Self-Paying Loans As a new DeFi-enabled financial primitive, self-paying loan protocols enable users to deposit assets as collateral and borrow/mint synthetic assets to provide working capital. The deposited collateral is routed to a yield-generating protocol, where the yield is used to automatically pay down the debt over time, creating a highly capital-efficient borrowing position. One implementation of this new financial primitive is Alchemix, a self-paying loan protocol that uses Chainlink Automation to provide users an advance on their future yield over time for deposits of DAI and ETH. Automation is used to trigger vault harvesting and vault flushing each day, automating debt repayment and reallocating new depositing into Yearn Finance to generate yield. Circuit Breaker In certain instances of exceptionally high volatility, the prices for assets on a cryptocurrency exchange may cease to reflect the prices seen on the wider market. This can lead to a loss of funds to arbitrageurs, or to users getting wrongly liquidated due to leveraged positions they had open. Such occurrences can reduce user trust in an exchange. Exchanges can benefit from using a circuit breaker that trips should certain deviations occur. Digitex is an example of a traditional exchange that protects users from market manipulation by monitoring for deviation between their internal price feeds and Chainlink Price Feeds as an additional layer of security for users trading on the platform. If the exchange�s price deviates beyond a certain percentage from the wider market price reported by Chainlink oracles, a �circuit breaker� can be triggered to temporarily halt trading and liquidations. Decentralized Exchange Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are on-chain trading venues that allow users to trade cryptocurrencies without taking custody of those assets or giving out personal information to a centralized institution. As DEXs grow in popularity, the desire for traditional trading strategies and advanced features currently available on traditional centralized exchanges grows in importance. 0x Relayer Bamboo Relay is an example of a decentralized exchange that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power stop-loss order functionalities�conditional trading functions based on the price action of an asset. With aggregated market data from Chainlink, each trader�s stop-loss order will only be executed when the market-wide price of the asset surpasses a certain predefined threshold, preventing market manipulation attacks from falsely executing trades. Bamboo Relay uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power stop-loss orders on top of the 0x protocol Automated Market Makers Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are an increasingly popular category of decentralized exchanges. Instead of traditional order books, AMMs are on-chain liquidity pools that facilitate asset swaps based on a predetermined price formula. By pooling capital, liquidity providers are able to earn passive yield and traders gain access to on-demand liquidity. DODO is an example of an AMM protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power a new AMM design known as a Proactive Market Maker. DODO�s PMM mimics human market-making behaviors and gathers more capital near the market price reported by Chainlink in order to facilitate more efficient and frequent trading. Staking Many protocols rely on some form of staking�the locking of cryptocurrency collateral into a smart contract�in order to secure their crypto-economic networks. Staked collateral might help signal where rewards should be proportionally distributed, or it can be �slashed��programmatically taken under certain conditions as a means of disincentivizing malicious behaviors. For instance, AdEx requires its validator nodes to stake collateral and maintain high availability. AdEx uses Chainlink oracles to monitor node uptime and trigger the slashing of collateral should any node fall below the uptime requirements. This ensures that only high-quality node operators participate in the network, which in turn enhances the security of the entire platform. Rebasing Rebasing is a new financial primitive within DeFi that involves the act of adjusting the supply of a token as a means to maintain its peg to a specific reference asset, such as the US dollar. If the price of the token is above its peg during the rebase, then more tokens are minted and given proportionally to all token holders with the goal of lowering the per token price. Conversely, if the price of the token is below the peg, then a certain percentage of each holder�s tokens are burned to raise the per token price. Ampleforth is an example of a protocol that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to power its native rebasing functionality. The total supply of AMPL is rebased on a daily basis to track the current Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate, an index from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on the current value of the inflation-adjusted 2019 US dollar. Both the volume-weighted average price of AMPL and the CPI index are provided to the Ampleforth protocol by Chainlink oracles. Ampleforth uses Chainlink oracles to rebase the AMPL token supply every 24 hours Real-World Assets As discussed in our recent education piece, tokenized real-world assets are among the most promising use cases for blockchain and smart contract technology. They take real-world assets and represent them on the blockchain as a token. Compared to traditional assets, tokenized assets benefit from global accessibility, permissionless liquidity, on-chain transparency, and reduced transactional friction. Liquidations Blockchain money markets are commonly overcollateralized to ensure user loans can be properly liquidated when the collateral drops in value and/or the debt rises in value, thereby keeping user funds in the market safe. However, because smart contracts are �asleep� by default, liquidations need to be performed by an external party to �wake up� the contract to close a position by paying down the debt. The process needs to be highly reliable to ensure no toxic loan positions on created and left open. Aave is one example of a money market protocol with tens of billions of dollars in user deposits that will use Chainlink Automation to help trigger the liquidation of user positions. Chainlink Automation will monitor the collateralization ratio of user positions, and if any position falls below the predefined threshold of the collateral (e.g. 150%), the decentralized Chainlink Automation Network will call the liquidation function and close the position, even during heavy market volatility and blockchain network congestion. Aave will use Chainlink Automation to help trigger the liquidation of undercollateralized loans. External Payments It�s easy for smart contracts to issue payments in the cryptocurrency of their native blockchain, such as Ethereum smart contracts issuing payments in ETH, for example. However, many businesses can�t afford the risk of holding volatile cryptocurrency assets on their balance sheet. They also don�t want the additional friction of trading out cryptocurrency for their preferred fiat currency. Given the wide variety of payment preferences around the world, smart contracts need access to many types of payment options to adequately service global demand. Chainlink can facilitate a wide variety of payment services thanks to its ability to push outputs from smart contracts to external APIs. Chainlink connects blockchains to external payment solutions Bank Payments Chainlink enables smart contracts to connect to existing banking systems, allowing smart contract developers to seamlessly integrate information and services such as consumer bank accounts, direct deposit, and other processes from leading global banks. Retail Payments Many consumer applications such as Uber and AirBnB offer popular retail payments to users. Chainlink can bring the same ease of use to smart contracts by giving them access to leading credit card providers and established payment networks, like PayPal and Stripe. Developers can start building applications that take advantage of the most in-demand payment outputs, both domestically and internationally, used on a daily basis in the retail economy. Chainlink already has pre-built modular external adapters for popular retail payment rails such as PayPal and Mistertango. Cryptocurrency Payments Cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly popular, but some of the popular choices are often disconnected from the leading smart contract platforms. Chainlink bridges the gap by allowing any smart contract platform to make payments on any other distributed ledger, such as Bitcoin payments triggered from the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, Chainlink Price Feeds can be used to provide exchange rates at the time of transfer or point of sale, ensuring users get fair market rates in a tamper-proof manner. Alchemy and Paycoin are examples of hybrid crypto/fiat payment platforms that will use Chainlink Price Feeds to determine exchange rates, allowing users to pay with a wide range of cryptocurrencies while the merchant still receives their preferred form of payment. Employee Salaries One significant source of inefficiency across nearly all industries in the legacy world is the delay in payments for services rendered to employees and contractors. Chainlink-powered smart contracts can be used to programmatically distribute payments to workers in real-time, which would reduce accounting overhead costs for employers, as well as providing access to earned wages for workers on a more immediate basis. Fiat on/off-ramp aggregator Transak laid out how this could work by using a work tracking API like WakaTime to trigger payments to developers on a regular basis. Additionally, Chainlink Price Feeds can be used to calculate the exact amount of crypto revenue to distribute, maintaining a certain USD value per payout. Remittances Remittances are quite common in an increasingly globalized world. However, despite advancements in technology, it�s a slow and expensive industry. Many DLT projects are aiming to disrupt the remittance industry and Chainlink oracles can provide reliable data on foreign exchange rates to smart contracts as well as enable direct deposit upon transfer. Onchain Finance Blockchain technology can replace backend processes across the financial system with modern digitized solutions. Through the automation of backend processes and syncing multiple ledgers of record, financial service providers can substantially reduce risk and enhance capital efficiency. Asset Tokenization Bringing real-world assets onchain�from currencies to stocks to bonds to real estate to gold�unlocks opportunities to increase investor access, enhance transparency, and strengthen market liquidity. Santander has reported that blockchain technology could help reduce banks� infrastructure costs by $15-20B annually through the automation of backend office operations. Having high-quality, reliable data about the market price delivered onchain by Chainlink Price Feeds is essential for the creation of high-integrity markets for tokenized assets. For example, the PAXG Chainlink Price Feed�a tokenized gold token redeemable for one fine troy ounce of gold�enables secure markets to be built around physical gold. Additionally, Paxos uses Chainlink Proof of Reserve to enable onchain verifications that their tokenized gold products are fully backed by gold reserves custodied offchain. To help bring capital markets onchain, Chainlink is working with The Depository Trust \u0026 Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world�s largest securities settlement system processing $2+ quadrillion annually. DTCC is exploring how Chainlink CCIP can unlock tokenized asset interoperability. Additionally, as part of a previous collaboration with Swift and Chainlink, DTCC minted and issued �BondTokens� compatible with CCIP and distributed them onchain to Swift�s designated test wallets. Cross-Chain Transfers CCIP enables the secure transfer of arbitrary data, tokens, and instructions between public and private blockchains. As the financial system increasingly moves assets onchain, CCIP can help securely transfer tokenized assets cross-chain, increasing access to the financial system for developing countries, enabling the creation of innovative new financial instruments, and enhancing liquidity for global markets. Swift and Chainlink, along with 12+ world-leading financial institutions, including DTCC, Euroclear, Clearstream, ANZ Bank, Citi, BNY Mellon, BNP Paribas, Lloyds Banking Group, and SDX, successfully demonstrated a secure and scalable way to transfer tokenized assets cross-chain using CCIP and financial institutions� existing backend infrastructure. �The collaboration between Swift, Chainlink, and the financial community represents significant progress towards enabling interoperability between traditional financial systems and emerging blockchain networks [�] By leveraging existing Swift infrastructure and Chainlink CCIP, the collaboration demonstrated the ability to transfer tokenised value efficiently and securely across public and private blockchains, using standardised messaging formats and proven business processes.��Swift Chainlink CCIP enables secure transfers between public and private chains. Corporate Actions Corporate action errors cost 70% of market participants more than $2M in 2020, of which 56% were due to data issues. Blockchains create a shared source of truth or �golden record� that aligns various stakeholders around an immutable source of hyper-reliable corporate action data. This helps mitigate costly errors and removes the need for downstream stakeholders in corporate processes, such as the custodian, to recheck the accuracy of key data from multiple sources. Having this golden record onchain along with high-quality data and computation delivered onchain by Chainlink enables various corporate actions to be automated with smart contracts, reducing operational costs and shortening processing times. For example, a tokenized bond could have predetermined coupon payments embedded within the digital asset at the point of issuance. Examples of corporate actions that can benefit from blockchain technology include: Dividend distribution�A shared source of truth makes it seamless for owners to be identified and the distribution sent to the correct person. Further efficiency gains could be achieved by distributing dividends via an onchain payments system. Distributing fund performance data�Publishing fund data onchain provides a reliable source of truth and makes it instantly available to all market participants, who can automatically pull that data into their own systems. Capturing proxy votes�Web3 systems make it easier to identify which investors have voting rights and enable them to cast or delegate their vote, reducing reconciliation costs and time, enhancing voting transparency, and removing operation risks around over- or under-voting. Ultimately, more seamless onchain voting systems could help raise voting participation among retail investors, which currently sits at just 28%. Cross-Chain Settlement Chainlink CCIP provides financial institutions with the ability to trade and settle tokenized assets across public and private blockchains, unlocking onchain DvP and atomic settlement for capital markets. For example, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ), the largest institutional bank in Australia with over $1 trillion in assets under management, worked with Chainlink to demonstrate cross-chain tokenized asset settlement transactions using CCIP and ANZ-issued stablecoins and tokenized assets. �The value and the message moving together is revolutionary. That�s a real breakthrough.��Nigel Dobson, Banking Services Lead at ANZ, at Sibos 2023 ANZ�s Digital Asset Services Portal integrated with CCIP to showcase how clients could transact tokenized assets across any blockchain through an existing web app. NFTs, Gaming, and Randomness While DeFi is currently the largest smart contract market, developers are increasingly building fraudproof, crypto-economically incentivized gaming applications. One of the unique characteristics of blockchain games is their ability to generate rare tokenized in-game items (mostly as NFTs), as the blockchain provides definite proof of the item�s rarity. Minting these rare items in a manner that the external entities or the game�s developers can manipulate to their own advantage is key to ensuring their value, which is why Chainlink developed a Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF). Chainlink VRF is a secure and provably fair source of Random Number Generation (RNG), which generates on-chain cryptographic proofs to prove to users that the randomness was not tampered with. Their provably fair form of randomness brings reliability to the rarity of items, opening up things like virtual metaverses, where tokenized items can be reliably used across different games. Verifiable randomness is also critical to creating unquestioned fairness to regulated gambling applications, removing the need to trust that the house is telling the truth about their odds. Additionally, Chainlink VRF can order participants for in-demand giveaways and events or fairly select participants for low-demand events like jury duty in an unbiased manner. Beyond randomness, gaming can benefit from numerous data sets, such as real-world event data to augment in-game functions/ratings, exchange rates to facilitate NFT markets, IoT data to connect the physical world on-chain, and much more. Random Rewards and NFTs In-game items are a critical component of most games, as they provide users with special powers or unique attributes. Many in-game items are issued as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a token that is unique and not interchangeable. Chainlink VRF is already playing an important role in generating provably random NFTs and creating NFT attributes as rewards for different predefined in-game achievements, such as earning a rare skin for finishing in the top 10. Aavegotchi is an example of an on-chain gaming project on the Polygon sidechain that used Chainlink VRF to quickly and efficiently mint provably rare Aavegotchi NFTs with randomly selected attributes when players opened Portals. Another example is Ether Legends, a digital collectible trading card game that uses Chainlink VRF to randomly distribute rare crypto-backed NFT prizes to top-tier players at the end of a season. Popular gaming dApp Axie Infinity also recently announced that it is using Chainlink VRF to generate provably random traits for Origin Axies within the game�s digital pet universe. Ether Legends uses Chainlink VRF to mint and randomly distribute rare crypto-backed NFTs Dynamic NFTs Dynamic NFTs expand upon the concept of NFTs by enabling such tokens to evolve and change over time as determined by real-world events or verifiable randomness delivered by Chainlink oracles. Compared to static NFTs, which do not change after minting, dynamic NFTs can change in rarity and utility over time, providing a gamified experience to collecting NFTs. MLB star Trey Mancini and NBA Rookie of the Year LaMelo Ball are two examples of athletes who have minted Dynamic NFTs powered by Chainlink oracles on the Ethereum blockchain. With the former, the NFTs are represented as limited-edition digital baseball cards that use Chainlink VRF to assign special utility to NFTs in a verifiably fair and unbiased manner, with all NFT sale proceeds going to cancer research. For the latter, the NFTs upgrade over time according to the player�s performance in the real world, where the EVOLVE tokens were activated when LaMelo Ball was selected as the NBA Rookie of the Year. Trey Mancini�s NFTs use Chainlink VRF to randomly assign additional utility. Random Gameplay Unpredictability is one of the hallmarks of fun games. The excitement of not knowing the next stage or what will happen around the corner creates suspense, intrigue, and challenge. Developers can leverage Chainlink VRF to ensure the integrity of unpredictable events. Some of these gameplay scenarios may include map generation, critical hits (battling games), matchmaking (multiplayer games), card draw order, and random encounters/events. Chainlink VRF enables smart contracts to use randomness for both inputs and outputs Prediction Markets Blockchain prediction markets enable individuals to bet on the outcome of specific real-world events. Due to their very nature, blockchain-based prediction markets, are reliant on external data to settle outcomes. Chainlink Data Feeds provide a decentralized, tamper-resistant source of external data that can be used to trigger the settlement of prediction markets as well as payment to the winners. Prediction markets have been created around sporting events results, political election outcomes, and cryptocurrency roadmap completions and price predictions, but ultimately prediction markets can encompass any type of wager as long as there are takers on the other side. Along with Chainlink Data Feeds, Chainlink Automation is increasingly playing a key role in enhancing the security and decentralization of prediction markets. Instead of relying on DevOps teams, centralized automation bots like cron jobs, or incentive bounties to start and stop each prediction round and select the winner, Chainlink Automation can automate smart contract functions by triggering smart contracts in a highly reliable, cost-efficient, and decentralized manner. Learn more in the Chainlink Automation developer documentation. Not only does Chainlink Automation save developers hundreds of hours, it also significantly enhances the security of prediction markets. By integrating Chainlink Automation into their prediction games to help start and stop prediction rounds and distribute rewards to winners, Entropyfi eliminated a single point of failure and was able to save 20 engineering hours per week. Everipedia, a blockchain-based encyclopedia, recently used Chainlink to relay election results on-chain to help settle prediction markets. Everipedia operates a Chainlink oracle node and delivered cryptographically signed data from The Associated Press regarding the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election onto the Ethereum blockchain, where Chainlink Data Feeds were then used by on-chain prediction markets such as YieldWars. Everipedia�s Chainlink node recently delivered the results of the 2020 US Presidential Election on-chain using data cryptographically signed by The Associated Press GameFi GameFi is a subsection of blockchain-based gaming. GameFi games enable players to earn in-game rewards. As its name suggests, GameFi lies at the intersection of blockchain-based gaming and decentralized finance. By offering economic incentives, developers can create an engaging gaming experience that encourages players to participate in the game�s ecosystem. On GameFi platforms, players can earn rewards by progressing through the game, battling other players, and completing special tasks. Rewards include in-game tokens and NFTs representing weapons, skins, avatars, and virtual land, which can then be traded or sold on secondary markets, such as decentralized exchanges or NFT marketplaces. Non-custodial ownership gives players full control over their in-game assets, potentially enabling users to take their NFTs to other games and metaverses in the future. Automation is essential for developing advanced GameFi experiences. Developers need to automate smart contract functions to start and end game rounds on time, distribute rewards to players based on particular game outcomes, and much more. While developers could automate these processes using scripts on a centralized server, this would consume valuable time and create a single point of failure that could lead to exploits and reliability issues. In contrast, by using Chainlink Automation, developers can trigger smart contract functions in a highly reliable, cost-efficient, and decentralized manner. For example, the gamified NFT platform Nifty Royale is using Chainlink Automation to help trigger its NFT-based battle royale games. Specifically, Nifty Royale is using Automation to trigger the smart contract functions that start and end each round of its battle royale. By using Automation, Nifty Royale is increasing the security and reliability guarantees of its game, which is especially important as players can win in-game assets that have real-world value. If you want to take advantage of Chainlink Automation in your own GameFi project, explore the docs now. No-Loss Savings Games Advancements in DeFi composability have led to innovative applications such as no-loss savings games�dApps which pool user deposits and lend them out on a decentralized money market in order to accrue interest. After a specified time frame, a winner is selected, earning all the accumulated interest from the pool. After the winner is chosen, all users are able to withdraw their original deposit without any loss. An example of this is PoolTogether, an on-chain no-loss savings game that uses Chainlink VRF to select the winner of each prize. By utilizing a transparent and verifiable source of on-chain randomness, users are provided a higher degree of trust in the overall reliability and fairness of the no-loss prize pool platform. PoolTogether uses Chainlink VRF to randomly choose winners in their no-loss savings game Sports and Esports Smart contracts provide integrity to the execution of an online sports bet, while Chainlink decentralized oracle networks can verify sporting outcomes by aggregating data from reliable web APIs. These smart contracts (usually in the form of prediction markets) can be based on a match�s result, individual performances, or even something as seemingly inconsequential as a game�s opening coin toss. On top of that, it�s possible for eSports prediction markets to retrieve gaming data and broadcast it on-chain to determine the winners. One example of a blockchain-based sports betting market is Augur, which uses Chainlink oracles on the high-throughput Polygon sidechain to power its Turbo prediction markets. Users can speculate on the outcome of a wide range of topics including different sports events in the NBA, MLB, MMA, and Olympics that are rapidly settled after a market closes using decentralized oracle networks that provide premium real-world data. Augur uses Chainlink Data Feeds to power their Turbo prediction markets. Insurance The insurance industry today operates in a low-trust business environment. Policyholders have an incentive to falsely report positive metrics in insurance applications to reduce their monthly deductibles and insurers have an incentive to delay payments and raise rates to account for misrepresented risk profiles. Since insurance companies are responsible for processing claims and are much more capitalized than policyholders, they wield substantially more power in terms of when and how claims are settled. Chainlink-powered smart contracts shift insurance contracts towards a more objective, equal-standing model where data directly determines the outcomes and execution is deterministic, without tampering by either party. Parametric Insurance Traditional insurance firms can leverage the benefits of blockchain technology by creating advanced smart contract-based parametric insurance agreements that automatically trigger payouts based on real-world data as delivered by decentralized oracle networks. By reducing reliance on manual arbitration and mitigating delayed payments as a result, coverage can be provided to a broader range of businesses to hedge a wide range of risks that exist in the real world. Crop Insurance Crop insurance has long been considered an especially promising use case for smart contracts as it provides farmers in developing nations with insurance which they otherwise could not get access to or don�t trust due to underdeveloped local insurance markets. By providing anyone with an Internet connection the ability to hedge against unforeseen weather conditions, farmers all over the world are able to maintain their livelihood without the concern that one bad weather season could cause financial ruin. One example of this is Arbol, a smart contract-based weather coverage solution that uses Chainlink oracles to fetch rainfall datasets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This data is used to settle parametric crop insurance contracts that provide coverage based on the amount of rainfall in the region. Arbol uses Chainlink oracles to fetch weather data used to execute parametric crop insurance contracts Flight Insurance One of the earliest forms of smart contract insurance to reach production is flight insurance. Due to a range of uncontrollable variables such as weather and maintenance, flights are often delayed, leading to inconveniences for business travelers. Flight insurance policies allow travelers to mitigate these opportunity costs, as they pay out compensation in the event of a delay. One example is Etherisc, a decentralized insurance protocol that leverages Chainlink oracles to retrieve flight data in order to confirm whether or not it�s been delayed. By removing the need for dispute periods, insurees are guaranteed that they will immediately receive a payment if their flight was delayed and insurers are able to reduce costs by removing manual claims processing. Car Insurance Modern vehicles come with a wide range of internal sensors, internet connectivity, and even native APIs. The winner of Chainlink�s 2020 Virtual Hackathon, Link My Ride, made use of some of these data points, allowing the smart contract to specify a rental period, unlock the vehicle doors for the renter, record the length of time rented, calculate mileage driven, determine the remaining battery charge, and automate rental payments. These functionalities came together to create a complex car rental contract for a Tesla vehicle using a custom external adapter. As vehicle-based APIs grow more sophisticated, new forms of insurance will become available including parametric car insurance that triggers based on numerous impact sensors in the vehicle or insurance discounts based on metrics like mileage driven per year. Home Insurance The growing �smart home� phenomenon is leading to sensors and advanced security systems that automatically inform homeowners and emergency services of unusual events. These sensors can be connected to smart contracts through Chainlink oracles in order to create new parametric home insurance products. Especially useful for vacation homes and other residences that are not used year-round, insurance products can be wired to detect broken pipes, malfunctioning solar panels, or even home intrusions as a means of a more direct skin-in-the-game alarm system protection from companies. Life Insurance Smart contracts with sound data are ideal for reducing the costs and occurrence of disputes, as well as speeding up the time of settlement. Numerous web APIs and external databases host sufficient data for determining if and when a death occurred, such as death certificates, obituaries, cremation records, and police reports. Chainlink can use that data to autonomously issue out payments and distribute assets amongst several parties listed in a life insurance policy, eliminating unnecessary overhead and accelerating payments to policyholders. Health Insurance Due to countless advancements in biotech and IoT wearables (e.g. Smartwatches), insurance companies can create smart contracts that offer health insurance discounts or trigger penalties based on a patient�s health data. Useful data points can include distance traveled (exercise), body weight, heart rate, and possibly more advanced biometrics as they are made available into the future. Chainlink oracles can also spot data anomalies that can trigger mandatory consultations in order to keep favorable policy rates. Gran Fondo, an ETHDenver 2019 Hackathon entry, used Chainlink oracles to bring GPS time-stamped data from IoT wearable devices on-chain to enable the creation of on-chain athletic competitions that payout in ETH. This same exact data can also be used to create health insurance contracts that determine premium rates based on the amount of physical activity within a certain time frame as recorded by the Chainlink-connected IoT wearable device. Marine Insurance Climate-related uncertainty is leading to increasingly unpredictable seaway conditions such as low or high water levels. This can result in hundreds of millions of dollars lost due to the temporary closing of major shipping seaway channels. Smart contracts can use Chainlink oracles to connect to an array of real-world sensors to issue parametric insurance coverage for a wide range of coverage protections, such as the thawing of frozen goods during transit, damages to shipping vessels, or late shipments due to unforeseen weather conditions. One example of this is a hackathon project aimed to insure cargo carriers in the event of the climate change-related closure of major shipping routes. Chainlink oracles connected to water level sensors that trigger insurance payouts in the event of water dropping or rising above present levels determined to lead to waterway closures. Reinsurance Insurance is a difficult industry for potential entrepreneurs to enter because of the risks associated with underwriting large numbers of policies. In a catastrophic event, an insurance company may be unable to cover all obligations, leading to default. As such, many companies �reinsure� their underwritten portfolio�offloading a portion of their risk in case they cannot cover all claims. One possible solution would be to tokenize reinsurance policies as smart contracts. This would allow individual investors to back insurance policies by buying fractions of a policy. Chainlink oracles can be used within this process to denominate the current value of an insurance policy, route insurance payments to token holders, and autonomously trigger insurance payouts. Enterprise Systems Smart contracts provide ample opportunities for enterprises to cut costs and improve efficiency in multi-party business processes thanks to reductions in counterparty risk, intermediary overhead, and external disputes. However, in order to leverage smart contracts, enterprises require additional considerations around privacy, scalability, and connectivity in order to meet certain business and legal requirements. Chainlink provides a gateway for enterprises to both sell their data and API services to blockchain environments and satisfy certain technical requirements like on-chain access to private data, off-chain computation of contract logic, on-chain privacy of transactions, and much more. Blockchain Abstraction Layer Just as the Internet acts as a single gateway for connecting computers, Chainlink provides enterprises with a single middleware for connecting their APIs to every blockchain environment. Chainlink is blockchain agnostic and can be integrated onto any current and future blockchain, with many leading chains already supporting Chainlink, such as Ethereum, Polkadot, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, and more. By having Chainlink operate across all the major chains, enterprises can leverage it as a �blockchain abstraction layer� used to get their existing systems �blockchain-enabled� across any/all chains efficiently. This reduces integration work to a minimum so enterprises don�t have to rebuild existing infrastructure, but instead can focus on their core blockchain strategy. Vendor lock-in is limited by removing the burden of enterprises to choose which blockchain is the most likely to become the industry standard. Additionally, Chainlink nodes provide key advantages such as secure private key management, secure off-chain computation, trust-minimized hardware, permission controls, and more. Enterprises can use Chainlink oracles as a blockchain abstraction layer to connect their backend systems to smart contracts across any DLT networks Monetization of Data and APIs Chainlink�s built-in flexibility ensures it�s fully compatible with existing legacy data and API infrastructure. Thus, data providers can also use Chainlink�s blockchain abstraction layer to sell their data to smart contracts on any blockchain. This can be done in two ways: selling data to the Chainlink Network or the data provider running their own Chainlink oracle node to sell data directly to blockchains. By selling data to the Chainlink Network, data providers don�t need to change anything about their current business model, meaning back-end modifications aren�t necessary and they can accept payments in fiat currency. Alternatively, data providers who see the value in the smart contract economy can run a Chainlink Node to provide signed data (using digital signatures) directly to smart contracts, allowing them to earn more revenue and build a reputation as a reliable data provider. Data providers can sell their data to the Chainlink Network using their existing API interfaces without modifications and/or can operate a Chainlink node to provide smart contracts with origin-signed data Node-as-a-Service (NaaS) Operating a Chainlink node enables data providers to begin selling their API connections to smart contracts applications. To simplify the experience of launching a Chainlink oracle node, infrastructure providers can offer Node-as-Service (NaaS) solutions in order to quickly spin up new Chainlink nodes and connect a data provider�s existing APIs to blockchain networks in a backward-compatible manner. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an example of a leading cloud provider that has collaborated with Chainlink Labs to launch the AWS Chainlink Quickstart�a one-click workflow for data providers and DevOps teams to easily launch a Chainlink oracle node on AWS Cloud and sell real-world data to smart contracts across multiple blockchain networks. The future-proof framework enables data providers to seamlessly launch a Chainlink node on AWS, allowing them to cryptographically sign their data and broadcast it onto blockchains where it can be sold to smart contract applications. The AWS Chainlink Quickstart gives data providers a single gateway to all blockchains Hybrid Cloud/Blockchain Applications As smart contracts evolve, there becomes an increasing demand for more advanced decentralized applications that require expensive or complex computations which are not feasible on-chain. One solution is using oracles to attest to off-chain computations processed within more scalable cloud computing environments. Leveraging Chainlink�s bidirectional communication capabilities, hybrid cloud/blockchain applications can be created that route computational instructions and/or data off-chain for processing, as well as bridge the results back on-chain for smart contract use. One example is NOAA weather hosted on Google Cloud which is being brought onto the Etheruem blockchain using Chainlink oracles. Through this integration, smart contracts can access high-quality weather data (temperature, precipitation, hail, etc) to power parametric crop insurance agreements such as those offered by Arbol. NOAA weather data hosted on Google Cloud being brought on-chain using Chainlink oracles Privacy-Preserving Data Queries and Credential Management For many enterprises and institutions, data privacy is not an optional bonus but instead a strict requirement necessary to meet regulatory mandates such as GDPR. Chainlink is developing a cutting-edge solution to this challenge through the recent acquisition of DECO�a privacy-preserving oracle technology created by an Ari Juels-led team at Cornell University. DECO allows all data transmitted over HTTPS/TLS, which is most of the world�s data, to be confidentially attested to by oracles without the data ever being revealed on-chain (it never leaves the off-chain database) and without any modifications to the servers hosting the off-chain data. For example, Alice is able to use DECO to prove her bank account balance is above a certain threshold without revealing her exact account balance or her identity on-chain or to the oracle itself. This opens up nearly all of the world�s data to be leveraged on-chain while still retaining confidentiality and data licensing agreements. Chainlink�s DECO uses zero knowledge proofs to enable the use of confidential data within smart contracts without revealing the data on-chain or to the oracles On-Chain Transaction Privacy In addition to privacy of data inputs, many enterprises want privacy of contract logic and outputs. Chainlink has developed a way of using oracles to provide on-chain transaction privacy for DeFi smart contracts via a solution called Mixicles. Mixicles separate the on-chain data inputs from on-chain payment outputs, using an oracle as the bridge between the two components and a transaction mixer. Instead of delivering the raw data input on-chain, Chainlink oracles post an integer representation that only has meaning to the contract participants (e.g. a 1 or 2 as seen in the example below). A mixer can then take that integer input to execute a payout to a party that is concealed, yet still produces an on-chain audit report for users as a means of meeting regulatory requirements. The Mixicles protocol is able to achieve multiple layers of privacy, such as concealing the terms of the contract, the data source used, the true value of funds within the contract, and who received the payment (in terms of correlation to the input). Private Off-Chain Computation Chainlink practices a defense-in-depth approach to security, where users leverage multiple layers of security to get a variety of guarantees. Another solution being developed by Chainlink is Town Crier, an oracle protocol that uses additional hardware in the form of a trusted execution environment (TEE) to achieve private, generalized off-chain computation. Town Crier uses TEE-based oracles (specifically Intel SGX) to enable Chainlink oracle nodes to perform advanced computations on data within a black box environment where data cannot be leaked, even to the node operator. Town Crier provides both data confidentiality and computation integrity, opening up new oracle use cases like handling private keys for cryptocurrency payments or user login credentials for identity verifications. Chainlink�s Town Crier uses Intel SGX to enable off-chain data confidentiality and computational integrity Solidity Computation As smart contracts continue to accelerate in adoption, there is an increasing demand for practical scaling solutions that can boost the throughput and lower the latency of decentralized applications, while retaining base-layer security of user funds. Commonly these layer-2 scalability solutions require the existence of one or more off-chain validator nodes that are responsible for batching transactions and delivering a succinct response onto the base-layer chain as needed. Chainlink oracle nodes are compute-enabled and can serve as validators for layer-2 solutions, such as for Offchain Labs� Arbitrum Rollups. Chainlink nodes can perform Arbitrum computation of Solidity functions, generate fraud proofs, and stake LINK collateral to back their services without any modifications. The end result is using oracles not just for data inputs, but for performing scalable off-chain Solidity computation too. Layer 2 Arbitrum Rollup chains can be operated and validated by Chainlink oracles, creating highly scalable smart contract applications secured by fraud proofs and cryptoeconomics. Infrastructure Provider Oracle Nodes Blockchains require a decentralized network of infrastructure providers such as validators, sequencers, transcoders, and oracles. Traditional infrastructure providers, such as telecommunications firms or internet service providers, can support the Chainlink Network and earn additional revenue by directly operating a Chainlink oracle node. By leveraging their existing in-house infrastructure, such providers can provide highly reliable oracle services and monetize the growth of the hybrid smart contract ecosystem. Deutsche Telekom MMS, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom (Europe�s largest telecommunications provider) operates a Chainlink oracle node and provides financial market data to numerous leading DeFi applications. As the demand for universally connected smart contracts continues to grow, the revenue opportunities can increase, leading to additional infrastructure providers launching Chainlink nodes. �By operating a Chainlink node, Deutsche Telekom MMS will provide reliable real-world data to Chainlink network users and decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum, further supporting the vision of public blockchains as a foundation for numerous use cases such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi).� �Deutsche Telekom MMS Deutsche Telekom subsidiary Deutsche Telekom MMS operates Chainlink oracle infrastructure and provides smart contracts with real-world data and events Abstract Cryptocurrency Payments Through Invoicing Given the novelty, volatility, and regulatory uncertainties around cryptocurrencies/tokens, some enterprises are currently hesitant to personally hold and handle cryptocurrencies. With most blockchain infrastructure requiring cryptocurrency to operate, enterprise adoption still remains limited or even completely blocked off. Instead of waiting on the often slow legal system to resolve the issue or for enterprises to warm up to the idea, Chainlink oracles can be used as a workaround to the problem using common invoicing techniques widely used today to allow them to pay third service providers in fiat, which then handle cryptocurrency payments in the background. Hackathon project LINK Gas Station takes the concept of Meta-Transactions�where blockchain transaction fees are abstracted away and paid by a relayer�and applies it to Chainlink. It uses third-party relayers to manage ownership of the utility tokens LINK and ETH, both of which are needed to pay for Ethereum computation and obtain Chainlink oracle data services. By doing so, the liability and complexity of cryptocurrency ownership shifts away from the enterprise and onto the chosen relayer, resulting in a process where an enterprise can simply pay an invoice in fiat and gain access to the entire decentralized ecosystem. Importantly, enterprises still have full control over the cryptographic private key required to sign-off on transactions. External Data for Baseline Protocol Baseline Protocol is a framework for syncing enterprise systems of record using the Ethereum mainnet as a common frame of reference. Baseline uses zero-knowledge proofs to ensure disparate enterprise databases are kept in a state of consistency (same set of records) with their counterparties without revealing any confidential data on-chain. Chainlink oracles are a key piece of infrastructure for ensuring Baseline events are using the same external data inputs. For example, dynamic purchase orders can leverage Chainlink oracles to fetch aggregated weather data (from multiple sources) regarding the temperature of the goods being shipped. The price per item in the purchase order can be autonomously updated depending on the temperature, such as bananas with dynamic pricing based on weather conditions. Chainlink�s ability to create consistency around external data inputs creates consistency among business partners, reducing disagreements and reconciliation. Multi-party agreements using the Baseline Protocol can use Chainlink oracles to fetch redundantly validated real-world data and events Bootstrap Legacy System Security As outlined in the whitepaper, Chainlink will use service level agreements (SLAs) and staking to create additional security and crypto-economic guarantees for oracle services. The SLA, which exists on-chain and is signed by both parties, defines the terms of the oracle service and the penalties/rewards issued based on the oracle�s performance. The results of the SLAs can be fed into reputation systems where future users can assess the reliability of a node. Enterprises running their own Chainlink Node can use staking-backed SLAs to bootstrap the reliability and security of their data and off-chain services, forcing them to have real economic stakes and reputation on the line for failing to meet their stated requirements. This allows enterprises and data providers to provide deterministic guarantees to automated processes like smart contracts without rebuilding their entire backend systems. Supply Chain A supply chain starts from the sourcing of materials and ends with delivering goods to the end customer. Along the route there are payments transferred, changes in ownership, customs clearances, regulatory oversights, and documents shared between parties. Smart contracts offer a way to automate these processes as a means of reducing friction and counterparty risks in global trade. Chainlink oracles can connect supply chain smart contracts to web APIs, cloud networks, and various real-world sensors, such as GPS, temperature, velocity, acceleration, humidity, luminosity, and more. This data can be used to trigger payments and transfers of data between parties in a manner that can�t be manipulated by any single party in the supply chain. Such a framework generates a golden source of truth for all involved parties with substantially less overhead. RFID Tracking Supply chains are increasingly making use of RFID (radio frequency identification) technology to track goods. RFID systems connect inventory items with tags that can be detected at distance via a radio frequency. This allows for simplified and highly efficient tracking of store merchandise, shipping pallets, and many other common inventory methods. With Chainlink oracles, RFID data from the real world can be used to trigger a wide range of on-chain contracts, including the initiation of payment upon receipt of inventory at a warehouse, or autonomous insurance payouts for delayed shipments. The Open Library Project, a project created during the Chainlink Virtual Hackathon 2020, used Chainlink oracles to build an RFID blockchain integration that enables users to check RFID-tagged books in and out and record this activity on-chain, creating a decentralized and borderless book rental platform. RFID devices can be connected to smart contracts using Chainlink oracles. IoT Sensors IoT sensors can be used to ensure that products in transit are properly maintained throughout the supply chain journey. Examples include keeping food at certain temperatures and sealing containers against tampering. Chainlink can be used to create blockchain IoT integrations by connecting IoT sensors to smart contracts that trigger onchain events, such as payouts and issuing fines depending on whether or not the IoT data confirms quality control standards were adhered to as defined in the predefined purchase order. Chainlink and Vodafone�s Digital Asset Broker (DAB) have successfully demonstrated the seamless exchange of trade documents across diverse platforms and blockchains using CCIP. This collaboration has the potential to enable applications in a supply chain to securely exchange data and tokens across public and private blockchains, and access data from IoT devices via the DAB platform. �Vodafone DAB and Chainlink are showing how their platforms can be combined to cut through this sea of incompatibility by bridging traditional markets with advanced decentralised platforms. This ensures seamless and secure exchanges of data and services across the global trade ecosystem, estimated to be worth over $30 trillion last year.��Jorge Bento, CEO of Vodafone DAB Another example of this is PingNET, a decentralized transmission network for IoT devices that uses Chainlink to help enable automated payments between stakeholders based on data from IoT-enabled pallets on PingNET. PingNet also aims to bring other IoT event data onchain, like Humidity, Altitude, UV index, Radiation, and more. Customs Clearance When cargo is shipped across borders to countries with varying regulations, most often it requires clearance from the receiving nation�s customs agency to prevent the shipment of illegal or dangerous goods. Many trade finance contracts will require access to this data to determine the status of a shipment in real-time. As smart contracts begin to automate such agreements, they will still require information regarding customs clearance. Chainlink oracles can directly provide this data in a privacy-preserving manner, allowing for end-to-end automation of a cross-border trade finance contract. Bill of Lading, Invoice, and Policy of Insurance International trade paperwork largely consists of three main documents: a Bill of Lading, issued by a carrier to acknowledge receipt of cargo for shipment; an Invoice, issued by a seller to a buyer regarding the details of a sales transaction; and a Policy of Insurance�a contract between the insurer and the policyholder stating the claims the insurer is legally required to pay. Each of these documents can benefit from oracles; it would be possible to use oracles to generate a Bill of Lading directly from data, provide foreign exchange rates to Payment Invoices, and provide IoT quality control data to an on-chain Policy of Insurance contract to trigger settlement. Utilities Utilities like water, energy, and the Internet are foundational pillars of modern society. The efficient functioning and management of these utilities is vital to social and physical health, yet they often rely on poorly incentivized business dynamics and outdated infrastructure. Smart contracts bring modernization to utilities infrastructure by moving them towards fairer, automated, real-time systems that use decentralized networks, data, and crypto-economic incentives to enforce such conditions. This ensures that utility providers are held to a higher standard and users have better access to objective data showcasing the quality and status of key utility services. Chainlink oracles can connect blockchain networks to utilities Internet, Telecommunications, and Cloud Hosting Many utilities like the Internet, cable TV, and cloud hosting charge customers based on set pricing structures. However, when their services go down, sometimes causing large financial losses due to opportunity costs (e.g. exchanges experiencing downtime due to a cloud outage), no one is held accountable. IoT sensors can monitor the uptime of utilities and Chainlink can feed their performance data into a smart contract to calculate monthly payments or issue reimbursements based on downtime. ETHNewYork 2019 hackathon entry Blocksolid explored a use case where NGOs could hold Internet Service Providers (ISPs) accountable for faulty internet services in developing regions. They did so by tracking Internet Service Provider (ISP) uptime and using Chainlink oracles to relay this data on-chain. If downtime is detected, the on-chain smart contract holding donated funds is updated to prevent withdrawals from the ISP. Energy Energy providers are responsible for ensuring all the world�s infrastructure receives the energy required to power the global economy. To increase the efficiency of energy delivery, Chainlink oracles can be used to feed consumption rates into a smart contract to trigger over-consumption penalties, levy CO2 taxes, and provide current energy prices to fairly generate electricity bills and allow payments in different currencies. Smart contracts can take readings from smart meters to monetize someone�s output, track consumption, and facilitate payouts between the two. Dipole, a blockchain-based distributed energy trading market, plans to use Chainlink Price Feeds to enable the on-chain trading and valuation of energy assets. Users can then purchase energy resources using fiat or cryptocurrency with exchange rates determined by Chainlink-powered decentralized price feeds. Water While often taken for granted, the infrastructure that ensures your tap at home can provide you with water is heavily monitored for quality control and reliability. IoT sensors can monitor water tables, track corporate consumption, and identify illegal siphoning of public bodies. Chainlink can feed data from this IoT data to smart contracts in order to issue regulatory fines, generate consumption invoices, trigger autopayments, update supply tracking databases, or even trigger emergency funding to cities at risk of floods. Emissions and Waste Management The emissions and waste disposal industries can be transformed by IoT-enabled smart contracts that can accurately measure output and efficiency. Through Chainlink oracles, this data can be used to automatically trigger payments to the proper regulating body for overconsumption, monetize the garbage used in recycling or waste-to-fuel technologies, or generate incentivized payment structures that lower garbage bills when someone consumes less or uses more biodegradable items. Authorization and Identity While smart contract-enabled blockchain networks are inherently pseudonymous, there is strong demand for users to be able to prove their real-life identity as means of ensuring Sybil-resistance and/or granting clearance. Through Chainlink oracles, traditional data infrastructure containing user identities (such as governmental databases, social media, etc.) can be connected to smart contract applications, either by tying a user�s identity to their on-chain address or attesting to data in an off-chain server. This ensures institutions are able to maintain full regulatory compliance and provide an additional layer of security via dealing with known identities. E-signatures E-signatures have become an increasingly popular way to obtain signatures on documents. They have modernized the signature process and helped companies avoid the costly overhead of obtaining a hand-written physical signature. With signatures being the most common way to authorize contracts, it�s a necessity that Chainlink oracles give smart contracts access to leading e-signature companies like DocuSign. Chainlink can benefit the e-signature industry in two ways: attesting to the e-signature and relaying it on-chain, or providing existing e-signature solutions with access to external data as a means of making their contract solutions more dynamic. FirmaChain, a blockchain-based digital signature and contracting solution, is using Chainlink oracles to allow its digital contracts to execute according to real-world data and events, like checking the authenticity of a driver�s license before approving a car rental. Another example is EthSign, an automated contract settlement framework where users can define off-chain data sources through Chainlink oracles as well as their respective trigger conditions. Biometrics Another verifiable way to authorize a smart contract is through biometric data, such as a fingerprint or a retinal eye scan. Since biometrics are uniquely identifiable to a specific person, they can be an effective way to verify someone�s identity as long as there is a reliable database or source to cross-reference it against. Chainlink oracles can both deliver the biometric data to the smart contract and connect it to different off-chain databases to verify authenticity. Chainlink oracles can connect smart contracts to biometric data. Credentials Using trusted hardware and/or advanced cryptography, Chainlink oracles securely handle the private account information of external systems and applications. This enables smart contracts to directly verify credentials, such as whether someone has the proper amount of funds or possesses a specific security key. Once Chainlink oracles relay the confirmation on-chain, the smart contract can trigger execution and settlement of funds. Bringing credentials on-chain can also be especially effective for verifying inputs before exchanging valuable assets. KYC/AML Institutions leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology often require additional infrastructure to ensure full regulatory compliance in regards to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. This requires the use of an external oracle to provide the data regarding the identity and full history of funds being transferred. Coinfirm is one example of a blockchain analytics firm that is using Chainlink oracles to bring data from its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) solution on-chain. This provides a plug-and-play solution for users wanting to add compliance to any on-chain application through real-time verification by an oracle network. Additionally, CipherTrace launched DeFi compliance oracle service on Chainlink to enable DEXs and other DeFi applications to abide by Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions requirements by providing source-signed compliance data on-chain. CipherTrace launched a Chainlink oracle node to bring AML data on-chain. Social Media Identity and Domain Names Blockchains still have a steep learning curve for many people, particularly around dealing with long hexadecimal addresses. In order to improve user experience, oracles are being used to help transform hexadecimal addresses into human-readable names like �chad.crypto�. One example is Unstoppable Domains, an on-chain domain name repository using Chainlink oracles to tie a user�s Twitter social media account to their human-readable on-chain address in a verifiable and transparent manner. This allows anyone to verify that a blockchain domain is tied to a user�s social media account before sending them funds. Unstoppable Domains uses Chainlink oracles to enable users to tie their off-chain Twitter identity to their on-chain Ethereum domain name Smart Contract Audit Results To ensure the integrity and proper functioning of smart contract applications, developers may want to verify whether or not a protocol has undergone one or multiple security audits before sending it funds. Using an oracle, users can get on-demand verification of audit results directly on-chain, opening up use cases like automatic checks before certain transactions, such as high-value ones, or when acting as a trusted custodian for other users funds. Cybersecurity firm Hacken will use Chainlink oracles to bring their security data on-chain regarding smart contract audits, penetration tests on centralized exchanges, bug bounties, and more. This data can then be utilized by smart contracts to prevent interactions with dangerous and/or unaudited smart contracts. Hacken uses Chainlink oracles to bring security audit reports on-chain to be used by smart contract applications Account Security Two-factor authentication (2FA) is another method a user can leverage to secure their online accounts, requiring an additional layer of verification beyond a username and password. This increase of security prevents unauthorized access to confidential information, as well as preventing the transferring of funds without multiple verifications. With Chainlink oracles, smart contracts are able to be enhanced with 2FA functionalities, directly protecting a user�s cryptocurrency holdings. Digital Bridge is an example of a project using Chainlink oracles to bring 2FA security to smart contracts on the Matic Network. By connecting to a high-availability 2FA API authentication service, Chainlink enables users to create a defense-in-depth strategy for their on-chain funds, preventing unauthorized transfers even in the event that their private key is stolen. Digital Bridge uses Chainlink oracles to enable smart contracts secured by 2 Factor Authentication services Intellectual Property All types of intellectual property, from royalties like copyrights and trademarks to license fees for patents, can be turned into smart contracts. Chainlink can be used to check IP databases for ownership verification, verify off-chain credentials before IP access, and facilitate payments from the user to the IP owner. Smart contracts could even tokenize partial ownership of IP and divvy out payments according to a person�s share percentage. Large enterprises such as Microsoft and EY have shown this to be a practical solution that significantly reduces operational inefficiencies in the rights and royalties management process. Contribution Bounties Open-source technology is growing in popularity, and can benefit from more expansive bounty programs to incentivize contributions. However, verification of a contributor�s work and payments to them are often manual processes, raising costs and delaying payout timelines. Chainlink oracles can be used to track contributions on public code repositories such as GitHub and unlock a payment escrow once predefined test cases for a bounty have passed without errors. Government While society may not agree on various issues, an initiative most people can get behind is creating more transparency, accountability, and efficiency in government institutions. Blockchains provide society with new infrastructure for tracking and executing government processes, smart contracts offer tamperproof guardrails on how governments are allowed to take action, and oracles allow for the use of objective data to trigger the execution of those actions as opposed to always leaving it up to centralized interpretation. Oracles are one of the most important ingredients to realizing the value of smart contracts within government processes, as they both provide a bridge to connect legacy infrastructure to blockchains and serve as the final triggers for executing the contract. Regulation Enterprise use of smart contracts will require new forms of automated regulatory compliance. While some restrictions can be hardcoded into the smart contract�s programmatic code, governments can also make use of oracles as a way of extracting metadata from the smart contract or requiring external approval from a government-run oracle before broadcasting a transaction. An example of a Compliance Oracle was outlined in the Project Whitney Case Study initiated by the Depository and Trust Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the post-trade financial services company that settles the vast majority of securities transactions in the United States. As stated in the case study, a compliance oracle is a �Dynamic rules engine that enables issuers and investors to maintain compliance throughout a securities lifecycle by approving/rejecting transactions. When a transaction is approved, the stock record is updated, and the movement of tokens on-chain occurs.� Voting Given the recent polarization around election results, there is increasing demand for secure, tamper-proof voting solutions that establish integrity in the election process. While it may take time to overhaul government voting systems, one can envision a simplified scenario where a vote can be cast on-chain using a private key, an oracle can verify the ID of the person from multiple approved sources in a privacy-preserving manner via DECO, and, if they match, then a confirmation is published on-chain where it is stored as an immutable record that can be cryptographically verified by anyone. This leads to the creation of a more sustainable democracy through tamper-proof voting, aligning with the United Nations� sustainable development goals. Deeds/Permits/Certificates Smart contracts can be used to bring more efficiency and integrity to the issuance of government certificates, permits, and deeds. Oracles can be used to generate certificates more autonomously, such as through using DECO to verify a person�s credentials before sending them a tokenized document such as a permit. Using a system like DECO allows the smart contract to query a set of authoritative sources in a privacy-preserving manner. Such an automated process could save billions of dollars in government spending. Sustainability Regenerative Agriculture Hybrid smart contracts that combine on-chain code and real-world data from IoT sensors and satellite data can be leveraged to create fully traceable, transparent, and automated incentivization systems that directly reward individuals, companies, and governments for taking part in sustainable practices and fighting against both climate change and mitigating its harmful effects. This can include the creation of tokenized carbon offsets, regenerative agriculture, and even the monitoring of consumption to reward those who stay within their means. The Green World Campaign is an example of one project that aims to use hybrid smart contracts to incentivize regenerative agriculture in a reforestation program created in collaboration with IC3 and funded by a Chainlink Community Grant. This program uses satellite remote sensing data that is fed on-chain by Chainlink oracles to reward stewards of regenerative agriculture who help reforest degraded land. By incentivizing carbon drawdown, their plan is to eventually plant billions of trees and help raise the living and health standards of those in developing regions. How AIRS incentivizes regenerative agriculture using satellite data, Chainlink oracles, and hybrid smart contracts. Satellite Imagery and Drones While slightly more advanced, it�s not hard to imagine a future where satellite imagery is used in combination with IoT networks and drones to gather data on external activities like a construction project. Through artificial intelligence, the data could then be analyzed and cross-referenced with past projects to determine the completion percentage of a project. Chainlink oracles could relay that data to an on-chain smart contract to issue completion-based payouts to construction companies, solving a major problem in delayed cash flows for companies performing large, time-consuming projects. During a fireside chat between Chainlink Labs Chief Scientist Ari Juels and Chainlink Co-founder Sergey Nazarov, Ari discussed his early work with PhD student Sishan Long on a project called AIRS: Automated Incentives for Reforestation Stewardship. AIRS aims to incentivize stewardship of the environment by consistently taking in satellite data (carbon capture capacity, the ability to sequester carbon, carbon sync capability, etc.) and monitoring its state over time using trusted execution environments. The idea is for entities like governments and NGOs to pour money into the smart contract, which then gets dispensed to the people who are responsible for maintaining and expanding this very important carbon sink, incentivizing sustainable practices. Off-Chain Computation Verifiable Randomness (VRF) On-chain applications do not have access to a secure Random Number Generator (RNG) due to the deterministic nature of blockchain networks. Using the on-chain blockhash can result in manipulation from blockchain miners/validators who discard blocks with unfavorable hashes and can �re-roll the dice�, ultimately changing the RNG value. Naive off-chain solutions are opaque and provide no proof that the RNG value produced is legitimate and has not been manipulated by either the data source or oracle node. Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) overcomes these issues by providing smart contracts with a secure source of randomness backed by a cryptographic proof that cannot be manipulated by oracle nodes, users, or development teams. Chainlink VRF works by combining block data that is still unknown when the request is made with the oracle node�s pre-committed private key to generate both a random number and a cryptographic proof. Consuming smart contracts will only accept the random number input if it has a valid cryptographic proof. This provides users with automated and publicly verifiable assurances directly on-chain that each smart contract application using Chainlink VRF for randomness is provably fair. Verifiable randomness can be used across a wide of use cases including dynamic NFTs, on-chain gaming applications, off-chain systems, and beyond. Chainlink VRF provides smart contracts a secure source of randomness Automation Smart contracts are pieces of code that run deterministically on the blockchain. However, they are �asleep� by default and must be �awoken� by some external entity to perform on-chain functions and change contract states. Chainlink Automation provides smart contract developers, decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) a solution to this problem through a highly reliable, decentralized, and cost-efficient decentralized network of nodes that can automate any smart contract function and perform regular contract maintenance. Chainlink Automation can be used for a wide range of smart contract functions including executing limit orders on a DEX, minting new tokens when a reserve increases in value, harvesting yield from a vault, rebasing elastic supply tokens, triggering automated trading strategies, liquidating undercollateralized loans, releasing vesting tokens, topping up token balances falling below a threshold, and much more. Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) It�s unlikely that one blockchain will come to dominate the entire smart contract market, especially when considering throughput limitations, jurisdictional differences, and specialization of chains. Such a multi-blockchain universe means that blockchains must cross-communicate with one another. However, due to their inherent security properties, blockchains cannot natively access data on other blockchain networks, a very similar issue to the oracle problem. Chainlink oracles can be used to bridge this gap by reading data on one blockchain and writing the results on another as a means of triggering some type of cross-chain interactions and/or simply an on-chain transaction on the chain requesting the information. The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is an open-source standard that will provide a secure, decentralized, and expandable cross-chain messaging solution that will enable smart contracts on any blockchain network to send messages, transfer tokens, and initiate actions across any other blockchain network. In addition to generalized message passing between chains, CCIP enables the creation of cross-chain bridges such as the Programmable Token Bridge reference implementation, allowing for the transfers of tokens along with commands to any other blockchain network. The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enables the creation of cross-chain applications. Fair Sequencing Services (FSS) While Chainlink oracles are commonly recognized for their ability to fetch and deliver data from the real world on-chain in a reliable and secure manner, they can also perform various off-chain computations including the ordering of transactions. Chainlink�s development of Fair Sequencing Services (FSS) will allow decentralized applications to mitigate Miner Extractable Value (MEV) by ensuring transaction ordering cannot be manipulated by miners as a means of siphoning value from users. Additionally, by preventing front-running attacks, gas costs can be drastically reduced and DEXs can become more trustworthy (e.g. trades are honored according to fairer rules like their arrival in the mempool). Chainlink Fair Sequencing Services enables the fair ordering of transactions to mitigate issues caused by miner extractable value (MEV) Blockchain Gas Price In order to prevent spam attacks, transactions on smart contract-enabled blockchains require the gas fees in the native token to pay for the cost miners expend to validate a transaction. However, the market that determines gas prices happens off-chain and thus smart contracts require an oracle to fetch the current cost per unit of gas. An example of this in action is ETHA Lend, an on-chain yield optimizer that uses the Chainlink gas price oracle to help build and execute algorithmically optimized yield strategies for LPs. Smart contracts can also use this gas price oracle to create gas price financial products and other financial products designed for hedging against blockchain network congestion and high transaction costs. Fair Participant Selection With the advent of blockchain-based public sales, many projects are looking for ways to fairly choose the order of sale participants beyond the common �first come, first serve�� model, which can be easily manipulated. Initially popularized by centralized exchanges, there is an increasing shift towards a randomized-based selection of sale participants within smart contracts. One example is Centaur, a DeFi platform that uses Chainlink VRF to determine the participants in an on-chain public sale. Based on a list of addresses accumulated before the sale, Chainlink VRF determines in a verifiable and fair manner which addresses from that list are allowed to participate in the on-chain public sale. Centaur uses Chainlink VRF to select participants in an on-chain public sale, ensuring equal opportunity of access Another example is Get Protocol, a blockchain-based event ticketing solution that uses Chainlink VRF to randomly determine a digital waiting line for in-demand concerts and events. This provides users with an equal opportunity to obtain tickets, in a manner they can independently verify on-chain as unbiased. Random Node Selection Some protocols use unpredictability as a form of security, for example by randomly choosing validators for block production. An insecure source of randomness would allow malicious actors to overly insert themselves into the process and manipulate the production of blocks, possibly even bringing the network to a halt. Chainlink VRF can be used as a tamper-proof source of randomness to fairly choose validators each time a block of transactions needs to be produced, protecting blockchain networks from a large category of key attack vectors. Conclusion As a generalized framework for building decentralized oracle networks, Chainlink provides developers the tools they need to connect their smart contract applications to any real-world data or events required for their use case. While the use cases listed above are not an exhaustive list, as there is an infinite number of smart contract use cases made possible by Chainlink, we believe they provide a starting point for developers who are interested in building new innovative decentralized applications.

    "content": "NFTs are fast becoming a vital type of digital asset. The rise in their popularity signals that blockchains are moving beyond cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, governance tokens, and utility tokens to break into today�s cultural zeitgeist�with these unique digital collectibles seeing growing adoption across media, entertainment, music, sports, and more. Whether you�re a creator looking for new ways to monetize your creativity using cutting-edge technology or a pioneering collector breaking into Web3 for the first time, this simple, step-by-step tutorial teaches you how to mint (create) your first NFT. To follow along with this tutorial, you should already be familiar with the MetaMask (or any other OpenSea-compatible) wallet. What Is an NFT? Before looking into how to create an NFT, it�s essential to understand exactly what an NFT is. NFTs are non-fungible, or unique, tokens, which means that no two NFTs are ever the same, even if they might look the same. This is because each NFT has a unique identifier. You can think of this like a barcode. Even if the same image is attached to two different NFTs, you�ll be able to tell the difference by their barcodes. This is also what makes NFT extremely powerful for creators. In the past, you could copy digital art endlessly, and there was no way to tell one file from the other. Now there is�and that�s just scratching the surface of what makes NFTs a paradigm-shifting technology. To dive deeper into the technical aspects of NFTs and what they can do, check out What Is an NFT? What Does It Mean To �Mint� an NFT? Minting an NFT means creating a unique token on a blockchain. Only after minting an NFT is the digital collectible stored on the blockchain. It�s important to know what is being stored during the minting process. It could be an entire work of art, in which case the entirety of the NFT and its metadata is stored �on-chain,� or it could be a reference to information stored off-chain using a tool like IPFS. Regardless of the data being stored, the simplest way to think about minting is as the process of creating an NFT. Minting Your NFT So you�ve decided you�d like to mint your first NFT. How do you get started? You could use an NFT marketplace like OpenSea or mint directly onto the blockchain via a smart contract. Let�s take a look at both methods. Minting an NFT on OpenSea Minting an NFT on OpenSea is straightforward. It consists of two steps. Connect your wallet to OpenSea. Click �create� and fill in the relevant information. Note, if you don�t have a collection, you may need to create that first. There are instructions in the �Collection� section to help. If you want a more programmatic approach to minting NFTs, deploying a smart contract to a blockchain like Ethereum could be a better option. Minting Directly From Smart Contracts Check if the contract has been verified. If you come across a contract for an NFT project and want to mint directly from a tool like Etherscan, you can do that if the contract has been verified. The checkmark next to �Contract� is the first thing to look for. This means the contract is verified. If the contract has been verified, you should be able to interact with it from Etherscan directly. 2. Follow the GIF tutorial below. You�ll need to select �Contract� then �Write Contract.� Once there, you should see the functions you can interact with. You�ll be looking for the mint function; it might be named safeMint. After you connect your wallet and provide your address, you should be able to mint the NFT to your wallet. Follow along with the GIF below to get started. Minting NFTs by Creating a Smart Contract Building smart contracts to mint NFTs is a more in-depth topic. The tutorials below will walk you through the various processes. How To Create an NFT Game How To Create an NFT How To Build an NFT Marketplace With Solidity and Hardhat How To Create Generative Art NFTs How To Create NFT Domain Names Build, Deploy, and Sell Your Own Dynamic NFT How to Build Dynamic NFTs on Polygon Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) How much will it cost to mint an NFT? The cost of minting an NFT depends on the method you use and the state of the network at the time you�re minting. If cost is a concern, NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea have a �lazy minting� function, which enables you to sell an NFT before it�s minted�with the buyer paying the cost. How can I sell my NFT? Selling an NFT is simple if you use an NFT marketplace. For example, OpenSea, Nifty GateWay, Rarible, SuperRare, and X2Y2 are all prominent NFT marketplaces many NFT creators use to sell NFTs. How do I mint an NFT on another blockchain? The NFT minting process is very similar for other blockchains if you mint an NFT through marketplaces like OpenSea. However, there may be blockchains that are not supported by a specific marketplace. A good place to find more information on which blockchains are supported is a marketplace�s help page.

    "content": "In this blog, we�re going to learn the fundamental design principles behind building upgradable smart contracts. By the end, you should understand why we upgrade smart contracts, how to upgrade smart contracts, and what issues to consider when you�re doing so. This blog is focused on Ethereum and EVM-based smart contracts. Watch the first part of this video to learn what the EVM is. To get the most out of this blog, you should have a beginner�s working knowledge of how blockchains work, specifically the Ethereum blockchain. There is a brief code walkthrough later in this blog, so having at least three months of programming experience would be useful, as would having some basic understanding of Solidity and how to compile it, what smart contracts are and how they�re deployed, and how to use tools like Metamask and Hardhat. What are Upgradable Smart Contracts? Blockchains are meant to be immutable�that�s one of the central tenets of blockchain technology. The data stored on the Ethereum blockchain, which includes the smart contracts deployed to it, is also immutable. Before we dive into the details of how to upgrade smart contracts, let�s consider why we would even want to upgrade smart contracts. The main reasons are: To fix bugs. To improve functionality. To modify functionality that is no longer required or considered useful. To optimize the code for more efficient use of Ethereum gas. To respond to evolutions in technology, markets, or society. To take away the need to migrate an entire community of users to a new version of the application. Given enough time, most things will need some repair work. But then data stored on blockchains is immutable. So then how can smart contracts be upgradeable? The short answer is that smart contracts are not themselves able to change�they�re permanent and immutable once deployed to a blockchain. But a dApp can be designed to have one or more smart contracts operate together to provide its �backend�. This means we can upgrade the pattern of interaction between those smart contracts. Upgrading a smart contract does not mean we modify the code of a smart contract that is deployed�it means we swap one smart contract out for another. We do so in a way that (in most cases) means the end user does not have to change how they interact with the dApp. So really upgrading smart contracts is a process of substituting a new smart contract for an old one. Effectively, new smart contracts are used, and the old ones are �abandoned� on the chain because they are immutable. How Do Upgrades Work? Smart contracts are commonly upgraded by using a software architecture pattern called the �Proxy Pattern�. But what does the word �proxy� mean in software design? You can refer to Section 5 in this System Design Primer I wrote, but the TL;DR is that a proxy is a piece of software in a larger software system that acts on behalf of another part of the system. In traditional Web2 computing, a proxy sits between a client application and server application. A forward proxy acts on behalf of a client application and a reverse proxy acts on behalf of a server application. In the world of smart contracts, the proxy is more of a reverse proxy, acting on behalf of another smart contract. It is a sort of middleware that redirects incoming traffic from the frontend to the correct smart contract on the backend of the system. Being a smart contract, a proxy has its own Ethereum contract address that is �stable� (i.e. unchanging). So you can swap out other smart contracts in the system and simply update the proxy smart contract with the correct address of the newly deployed smart contract. End users of the dApp interact with the proxy directly, and with the other smart contracts only indirectly, via the proxy. So, in smart contract development, the Proxy Pattern is achieved through the following two pieces: The proxy smart contract The execution contract, also called the logic contract or the implementation contract. In this blog, we will refer to these elements as the proxy contract and the logic contract, respectively. There are three common variants of the proxy pattern, which we will discuss below. Simple Proxy Pattern A simple proxy has the architecture shown below. Let�s dive deeper into how this works under the hood. In the EVM, there is something called the �execution context�. Think of this as the space in which code is executed. So the proxy contract has its own execution context, and so do all other smart contracts. The proxy contract also has its own storage, where data is stored permanently on the blockchain, along with its own ether balance. Together, the data and balance that the smart contract holds are called its �state,� and state is part of a its execution context. The proxy contract uses storage variables to keep track of the addresses of other smart contracts that make up the dApp. This is how it can redirect transactions and call the relevant smart contract. But there is a clever trick that is used to pass the message calls to the correct contract. The proxy contract doesn�t just do a regular function call to the logic contract; it uses something called a delegatecall. Delegatecall is like a regular function call except that the code at the target address is executed in the context of the calling contract. If the logic contract�s code changes storage variables, those changes are reflected in the proxy contract�s storage variables�i.e. in the proxy contract�s state. So where in the proxy contract does the delegatecall logic sit? The answer lies in the proxy contract�s fallback function. When the proxy contract receives a function call for a function that it does not support, the proxy contract�s fallback function will be invoked to handle that function. The proxy contract uses a custom logic inside its fallback function to redirect calls to logic contracts. Applying this principle to the proxy and the logic contract, delegatecall will call the logic contract�s code, but that code gets run inside the execution context of the proxy contract. What this means is that the code in the logic contract has the power to change the state in the proxy contract�it can change state variables and other data stored inside the proxy contract. This effectively decouples the application�s state from the code that gets executed. The proxy contract effectively holds all the dApp�s state, which means that the logic can be changed without losing that state. Now that the application state and the application logic are decoupled in the EVM, we can upgrade the application by changing the logic contracts, and giving the new addresses to the proxy. But the application�s state isn�t affected by this upgrade. There are two common issues that we need to watch out for when using proxies. One issue is storage collisions; the other is another type of collision called proxy selector clashing. You can read the linked article about storage collisions to learn more, but for now we will focus on selector clashes because they are the underlying reason for the proxy pattern we will be examining. As we saw previously, proxies delegate all function calls to the logic contract. However, the proxy contracts also have functions themselves, which are internal to them and necessary for their operation. For example, a proxy contract would need a function like upgradeTo(address newAdd) to upgrade to the new logic contract�s address. So what happens if the proxy contract and the logic contract have a function with the same name and signature (parameters and types)? How would the proxy contract know whether to call its own function or to delegatecall out to the logic contract? This is known as �proxy selector clashing� and is a security vulnerability that can be exploited, or at the very least be a source of annoying bugs. Technically, this clash can also happen between functions even if they have different names. This is because every publicly callable function (a function that can be defined in the ABI) is identified at the bytecode level by an identifier that is four bytes long. Since it�s only four bytes, it is technically possible for the first four bytes of two completely different function signatures to just happen to be identical, thus producing identical identifiers for dissimilar function signatures, resulting in clashes. Fortunately, the Solidity compiler can detect this sub-type of selector clashes when the clash is produced by function signatures within the same contract, but not when such a clash happens across different contracts. For example, if a clash happened between a proxy contract and logic contract, the compiler would not be able to detect it, but inside the same proxy contract, the compiler would detect the clash. The solution to this problem is the �transparent� proxy pattern, which has been popularized by Open Zeppelin. Transparent Proxy Pattern The transparent proxy pattern is where function calls initiated by the end user (caller) are always routed to the logic contract rather than the proxy contract. However, if the caller is an admin of the proxy, the proxy will know to invoke its own administrative function. This makes intuitive sense because calling administrative functions in the proxy contract to manage the upgradability and other admin tasks should only be done by an admin, and if there is a clash, a fair presumption can be made that the admin intended to call the proxy contract�s function and not the logic contract�s function. But if the caller is any other non-admin address, the proxy will always delegatecall out to the relevant logic contract. We can identify the caller by examining the message.sender value. In this pattern, the proxy contract would have logic in its fallback function to parse message.sender and the function selector that is being called, and accordingly invoke one of its own functions or delegate out to a logic contract. OpenZeppelin contracts, as we will see in our code walkthrough, add another level of abstraction, with the upgrade functionality owned by a ProxyAdmin contract�the smart contract that is the admin for one or more proxy contracts. This proxy admin contract must be the caller for upgrade-related functionality. So end users will interact directly with the proxy, which will delegatecall out to the logic contract, but upgrade and admin requests will be passed via the ProxyAdmin contract, which will then forward the upgrade request to the proxy. Transparent proxy patterns do have some drawbacks. They�re susceptible to function selector clashes if they�re not handled carefully, they can cost more gas to operate (as the EVM needs extra gas to load the logic contract address for each delegatecall), and deploying the proxy contract in this pattern can also cost more gas. UUPS pattern The Universal Upgradable Proxy Standard (UUPS) was proposed in EIP1822 as a way to create a standard for proxy contracts that have universal compatibility with all contracts. It overcomes the issue of proxy function selector clashes. This pattern also uses Solidity�s delegatecall operation, but whereas in the Simple/Transparent proxy pattern all upgrades are managed by the proxy contract, in UUPS, the upgrades are handled by the logic contract�specifically the �proxiable� smart contract that the logic contract inherits from. The logic contract will still be executed in the context of the proxy contract, thus utilizing the proxy contract�s storage, balance, and address, but the logic contract inherits from the Proxiable parent contract that houses the upgrade functionality. The upgrade logic contained in the proxiable smart contract is used to update the logic contract�s address, which is stored in the proxy contract. Since the Solidity compiler is able to detect function selector clashes if they arise within the same contract, the presence of the upgrade logic in the parent proxiable contract helps the compiler identify such clashes, which reduces their likelihood. The UUPS proxy pattern also has drawbacks. Though deployment in this pattern is cheaper (less gas), maintaining the dApp�s smart contracts using this pattern can be a bit more challenging. An important issue is that because the upgrade logic is not in the proxy contract but rather in the logic contract�s proxiable parent contract, if an updated logic contract fails to inherit proxiable then the upgrade functionality is not inherited and it�s impossible to upgrade the smart contract in future. But this issue has an upside: The UUPS pattern allows for upgradability to be removable by simply no longer inheriting from the proxiable contract, which is an option not inherent in the Transparent Proxy pattern. This is why OpenZeppelin and others recommend that UUPS is used over Transparent Proxies, though Transparent remains more popular at the time of writing. Code Along To get started we will employ the Transparent Proxy pattern using OpenZeppelin upgrades tooling, which works with common Web3 development workflows that use JavaScript and Hardhat. OpenZeppelin offers plugins that integrate with Hardat and Truffle. We will use Hardhat. The Hardhat Plugin gives us functions like deployProxy that track the logic contract for us and give us easy access to upgrade functionality. By default, the address that deployed the contract is the one that has admin rights to upgrade it. Let�s create a Hardhat project�you can name it whatever you want�and from inside that directory, let�s start to set up our project tooling with the following steps. Project Setup Install the Hardhat developer tools, Web3 libraries, and the upgrades plug-in provided by OpenZeppelin. The below command will create your package.json file as well. yarn add -D hardhat @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers Install contract packages from NPM that contain the Chainlink contract interfaces and OpenZeppelin upgradeable contract libraries we will want to use: yarn add @chainlink/contracts� @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable Then run yarn hardhat inside the project root directory to create an empty hardhat.config.js file in the root. Inside that config file, paste the following to tell Hardhat which compiler version the project will use while importing the right dependencies: require(\"@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers\");\r\n\r\nrequire(\"@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades\");\r\n\r\nconst GOERLI_RPC_URL \u003d process.env.GOERLI_RPC_URL_HTTP\r\nconst PRIVATE_KEY \u003d process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_DEV1;\r\n\r\nconst ETHERSCAN_KEY \u003d process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY;\r\n\r\n/** @type import(\u0027hardhat/config\u0027).HardhatUserConfig */\r\nmodule.exports \u003d {\r\n�solidity: \"0.8.17\",\r\n�defaultNetwork: \"hardhat\",\r\n networks: {\r\n ��localhost: {\r\n�����chainId: 31337,\r\n ��},\r\n ��goerli: {\r\n ����url: GOERLI_RPC_URL,\r\n�����accounts: PRIVATE_KEY ? [PRIVATE_KEY] : [],\r\n�����chainId: 5,\r\n ��},\r\n },\r\n etherscan: {\r\n ��apiKey: ETHERSCAN_KEY,\r\n },\r\n}; Smart Contract Code In your project root, create a \u003croot\u003e/contracts/PriceFeedTrackerV1.sol Solidity file and paste the following smart contract into it: // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol\";\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract PriceFeedTracker is Initializable {\r\n���address private admin;\r\n\r\n���function initialize(address _admin) public initializer {\r\n�������admin \u003d _admin;\r\n ��}\r\n\r\n���function getAdmin() public view returns (address) {\r\n�������return admin;\r\n���}\r\n\r\n���/**\r\n ���* Network: Goerli\r\n ���* Aggregator: ETH/USD\r\n ���* Address: 0xD4a33860578De61DBAbDc8BFdb98FD742fA7028e\r\n ���*/\r\n���function retrievePrice() public view returns (int) {\r\n\r\n�������AggregatorV3Interface aggregator \u003d AggregatorV3Interface(\r\n\r\n�����������0xD4a33860578De61DBAbDc8BFdb98FD742fA7028e\r\n ������);\r\n ������(\r\n ����������,\r\n�����������/*uint80 roundID*/\r\n�����������int price, /*uint startedAt*/ /*uint timeStamp*/ /*uint80 answeredInRound*/\r\n ����������,\r\n�����������,\r\n\r\n�������) \u003d aggregator.latestRoundData();\r\n\r\n�������return price;\r\n ��}\r\n}� If you now run yarn hardhat compile you should see that the Solidity code compiles successfully and you have two new folders, �Artifacts� and �cache,� in your project directory. You�ll note that this V1 smart contract retrieves the ETH/USD price data from Chainlink Price Feeds on the Goerli network. Right now, the Price Feed�s address is hardcoded, which means it can only ever return the ETH/USD price. In future, we will upgrade it to handle any asset pair�s Price Feed address on the Goerli network. For now though, let�s consider what�s going on with Initializable and the initialize() function. Due to some quirks in Solidity that are out of scope for this blog, we cannot include a constructor in our smart contracts when we use Open Zeppelin upgradable contracts. Instead, we create our own construtor-like functionality by extending the Initializable base contract, which helps us apply an initializer modifier to the initialize() function. We can name the initialize function anything we like, but by using initialize, the Hardhat plugin will recognize it, and will call that function by default. If we have an initializer function by another name, we would need to specify the name of our initializer. This �Initialize� pattern, with the modifier, simulates a constructor function by ensuring that initialize() is run only once. This is where we can expressly set our admin address if we want to�the default will be the deployer�s address. The retrievePrice() function calls the ETH/USD Price Feed smart contract and returns the exchange price. Deploy Script Let�s deploy this V1 contract using the following script in scripts/deploy_upgradeable_pricefeedtracker.js . // The Open Zeppelin upgrades plugin adds the `upgrades` property\r\n// to the Hardhat Runtime Environment.\r\nconst { ethers, network, upgrades } \u003d require(\"hardhat\");\r\n\r\nasync function main() {\r\n�// Obtain reference to contract and ABI.\r\n�const PriceFeedTracker \u003d await ethers.getContractFactory(\"PriceFeedTracker\");\r\n�console.log(\"Deploying PriceFeedTracker to \", network.name);\r\n\r\n�// Get the first account from the list of 20 created for you by Hardhat\r\n�const [account1] \u003d await ethers.getSigners();\r\n\r\n�//� Deploy logic contract using the proxy pattern.\r\n�const pricefeedTracker \u003d await upgrades.deployProxy(\r\n���PriceFeedTracker,\r\n\r\n���//Since the logic contract has an initialize() function\r\n���// we need to pass in the arguments to the initialize()\r\n���// function here.\r\n���[account1.address],\r\n\r\n���// We don\u0027t need to expressly specify this\r\n���// as the Hardhat runtime will default to the name \u0027initialize\u0027\r\n���{ initializer: \"initialize\" }\r\n );\r\n�await pricefeedTracker.deployed();\r\n\r\n�console.log(\"PriceFeedTracker deployed to:\", pricefeedTracker.address);\r\n}\r\n\r\nmain(); By using deployProxy() in the OpenZeppelin Upgrades Plugins, that deployed contract instance can be upgraded later. By default, only the address that originally deployed the contract has the rights to upgrade it. deployProxy will create the following transactions: Deploy the logic contract (our PriceFeedTracker contract). Deploy a proxy contract and run any initializer function. Deploy a ProxyAdmin contract (the admin for our proxy). Before we run the deploy script, make sure you have enough Goerli ETH. You can get Goerli ETH from the Chainlink faucet. Make sure that you also set your RPC node URL and private key in your environment variables so that your hardhat.config.js file can read them! We can run our deploy script with the following command to deploy the contract to the Ethereum Goerli testnet. yarn hardhat run --network goerli scripts/deploy_upgradeable_pricefeedtracker.js That should produce a confirmation in your terminal that looks like the below but with a different contract address. Make a note of this contract address. Note that it is the address of your proxy contract, not the logic contract. We want the proxy contract�s address because that is the stable (unchanging) address we will use to interact with our logic contracts. Deploying PriceFeedTracker...\r\nPriceFeedTracker deployed to: 0x5FC8d32690cc91D4c39d9d3abcBD16989F875707 You can study the documentation for deployProxy() and its configuration options here. Note that the default pattern is �transparent� but you can specify that you want your proxy to follow the UUPS pattern by explicitly setting that configuration option. Hardhat Console Before we upgrade our contract, let�s interact with it using the Hardhat console, which allows us to write JavaScript to interact with our logic contract, which is deployed via the proxy contract. In a new (third!) terminal window, run the following command to attach the console to the Goerli blockchain: yarn hardhat console --network goerli That will open up the console prompt into which you can run the following commands individually: \u003e const PriceFeedTracker \u003d await ethers.getContractFactory(\"PriceFeedTracker\");\r\nundefined \u003e const priceFeedTracker \u003d await PriceFeedTracker.attach(\u0027\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c YOUR CONTRACT ADDRESS� \u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u0027) \r\nundefined Then call the getAdmin() getter function, which should output your deployer wallet address�the address you passed in to your initialize function�s argument inside your deploy script. \u003e (await priceFeedTracker.getAdmin())\r\n\u00270xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266\u0027 Next try retrieving the ETH/USD price. This is a view-only call as it does not modify state or emit any events, so you don�t need to pay gas. \u003e (await v1.retrievePrice())\r\nBigNumber { value: \"150701000000\" } Ok! If you�re getting these results, then the proxy contract is correctly interacting with your deployed proxy contract. Here is a useful tip: Go to goerli.etherscan.io/address/YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS and then click on the Events tab. You should see several events that look like the below picture. Look for an event called �Upgrade� and click on the little arrow beside it. That will show you the address of the implementation contract. This is the address that will end up changing each time you upgrade your smart contract. Upgraded Logic Contract Now let�s put together an updated logic contract that has some added functionality. Take a look at PriceFeedTrackerV2 below. You�ll note the following changes: There is a new public storage variable called price, which is of type int which will store the retrieved price. There is a new Event that emits two pieces of data when the Price Feed is updated. The retrievePrice() function no longer hardcodes the ETH/USD address but instead gets the Price Feed�s address from the caller. It also checks that a non-zero address is passed in. Once the price is retrieved it emits an event and also stores the price in the price state variable (both operations change the blockchain�s state, so this is no longer a view function). // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol\";\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract PriceFeedTrackerV2 is Initializable {\r\n���address private admin;\r\n���int public price; // NOTE: new storage slot\r\n\r\n���// Emitted when the price is retrieved changes\r\n���event PriceRetrievedFrom(address feed, int price);\r\n\r\n���function initialize(address _admin) public initializer {\r\n�������admin \u003d _admin;\r\n���}\r\n\r\n���function getAdmin() public view returns (address) {\r\n�������return admin;\r\n ��}\r\n\r\n���// Fetches the price from the feed.\r\n���// Note that the function is no longer a view function as it emits an event.\r\n���function retrievePrice(address feed) public returns (int) {\r\n�������require(\r\n�����������feed !\u003d address(0x0),\r\n�����������\"PriceFeedTrackerV2: Pricefeed address must not be zero address.\"\r\n�������);\r\n\r\n�������AggregatorV3Interface aggregator \u003d AggregatorV3Interface(feed);\r\n ������(\r\n ����������,\r\n�����������/*uint80 roundID*/\r\n�����������int _price, /*uint startedAt*/ /*uint timeStamp*/ /*uint80 answeredInRound*/\r\n ����������,\r\n�����������,\r\n\r\n�������) \u003d aggregator.latestRoundData();\r\n\r\n�������price \u003d _price;\r\n\r\n�������emit PriceRetrievedFrom(feed, _price);\r\n\r\n�������return price;\r\n ��}\r\n} There is an important technical issue regarding the storage variables that we must note at this stage. You�ll see that the admin state variable is left in exactly the same �position� and the price variable is declared after it. This is because when logic contracts are updated they must not change the order of the declaration of state variables, as that would cause a storage clash (otherwise known as a storage collision) because the storage context is in the proxy contract (as discussed earlier in this blog). This is because state variables are generally assigned storage layout �slots� in the context of the proxy contract, and these slots must be unchanged across the upgrades of the logic contract. So we cannot replace storage slots or insert new ones in between. All new state variables must be appended at the end, in a slot that has not previously been taken up. OpenZeppellin uses EIP1967 storage slots to avoid storage clashes in logic contracts. You can read more about the deeper details of the OpenZeppelin proxy patterns and storage here. Deploy Script for Upgrade Contract The upgrade logic contract has a different name and new functionality. We can upgrade the V1 instance by calling the upgradeProxy function, which creates the following transactions: Deploy the updated logic contract (our PriceFeedTrackerV2 contract). Call ProxyAdmin contract (the admin for our proxy) to update the proxy contract to point to the new logic contract. Our updated script will be in scripts/upgrade_pricefeedtracker.js and will look like this (note how we use upgradeProxy and not deployProxy). It�s very important to note that you must add your deployed contract�s address before you run the script�forgetting this is an easy mistake to make that could confuse you for hours! const { ethers, upgrades } \u003d require(\"hardhat\");\r\n\r\nasync function main() {\r\n��// TODO Check this address is right before deploying.\r\n� const deployedProxyAddress \u003d \"\u003c\u003c\u003c YOUR PROXY CONTRACT ADDRESS HERE \u003e\u003e\u003e\";\r\n\r\n� const PriceFeedTrackerV2 \u003d await ethers.getContractFactory(\r\n� � \"PriceFeedTrackerV2\"\r\n� );\r\n� console.log(\"Upgrading PriceFeedTracker...\");\r\n\r\n��await upgrades.upgradeProxy(deployedProxyAddress, PriceFeedTrackerV2);\r\n� console.log(\"PriceFeedTracker upgraded\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nmain(); \r\n We can then run the script with yarn hardhat run --network goerli scripts/upgrade_pricefeedtracker.js And we should see an output that looks like Compiled 2 Solidity files successfully\r\nUpgrading PriceFeedTracker...\r\nPriceFeedTracker upgraded Note that the proxy address is unchanged. But if you go back to Etherscan and look at your proxy contract�s emitted events you should see a new �Upgraded� event and a new implementation contract address. If your contract is taking forever to deploy, please scroll down to the troubleshooting section of this blog. Now let�s use the Hardhat console to interact with the upgraded contract. Run the following commands, one at a time. I recommend leaving 60-90 seconds after you request the price before you check the price state variable. \u003e var V2 \u003d await ethers.getContractFactory(\"PriceFeedTrackerV2\")\r\nundefined\r\n\r\n\u003e var v2 \u003d await V2.attach(///// INSERT PROXY CONTRACT ADDRESS /////)\r\nundefined\r\n\r\n// ETH/USD\r\n\u003e var ethusdTx \u003d await v2.retrievePrice(\u00270xD4a33860578De61DBAbDc8BFdb98FD742fA7028e\u0027) \r\nundefined\r\n\r\n// Wait about 60-90 seconds then read the updated state variable.\r\n\u003e (await v2.price())\r\nBigNumber { value: \"150701000000\" }\r\n\r\n// Change to LINK/ETH\r\n\u003e var linkEthTx \u003d await v2.retrievePrice(\u00270xb4c4a493AB6356497713A78FFA6c60FB53517c63\u0027)\r\n\r\n// Wait about 60-90 seconds then read the updated state variable.\r\n\u003e (await v2.price())\r\nBigNumber { value: \"4659009800000000\" } You�ll note that we updated the price variable to store the retrieved price from the ETH/USD Price Feed aggregator contract and then again from the LINK/ETH Price Feed. And there you have it! You have just upgraded your logic contract, and the contract that you interact with (the proxy contract) has not changed! The proxy contract delegates the logic function calls to the logic contract that is registered with the proxy contract as being the latest logic contract! Troubleshooting There are a couple of problems that could arise when running transactions with upgradeable contracts on the Goerli network. One problem that I encountered when writing this blog was that my transactions were getting stuck in the mempool. This is because the gas that was being sent from my wallet was less than the gas required by the network at that time�there were gas spikes on Goerli at the time of writing. There were no errors suggesting this had happened, so it took me a while to figure out! I use Alchemy as my RPC provider to connect to Goerli, so I found this video to help me get unblocked. I created this script to run as a Hardhat script which helped me clear my mempool transactions. Also, note that it�s best to wait for about 60 seconds after any transaction that changes the state of the blockchain. For example, reading from the price storage variable too soon after running retrievePrice() will return older data from the blockchain as the state-changing write transactions may not have been confirmed by blocks yet. Conclusion We�ve covered how to upgrade smart contracts, why we would want to, and what the emerging practices are around upgrading smart contracts. We�ve learned a few design patterns, some issues that could trip you up, and also run some code to deploy and upgrade a smart contract that consumes data from Chainlink Price Feeds.

Compared to their Web2 counterparts, Web3 founders lack access to the abundance of knowledge and resources that come with an established sector. But given the nascent nature of the Web3 industry, there�s immense opportunity and an open frontier of ideas for founders to build and find success with. This is the Web3 startup tradeoff�building a standout Web3 startup requires that founders venture into previously unexplored territories that only a select few have successfully navigated. There is more opportunity and fresh ground to explore, but less guidance on offer as a result. However, there are still some resources for founders to draw from, plus the examples of those who have gone before. This post provides founders with the most recent information, guidance, and resources on how to effectively launch, fund, grow, and scale a Web3 startup. Subscribe to the Missing Link Get more Web3 startup guides and resources straight to your inbox. Subscribe Product Web3 products are often software products, meaning founders can leverage the same lean-startup model that has proven successful in Web2 technology companies. The core of this model can be broken down into three iterative processes�build, measure, and learn. By following these steps, startups can minimize the time and effort spent on product development to quickly find product-market fit. Discover how to effectively gauge demand and build Web3 products that users actually want by reading this blog. Assessing Product-Market Fit But what does it mean to actually achieve product-market fit, and how do you measure it? This article dives into the theory behind finding product-market fit and provides time-tested conceptual frameworks for Web3 startups to understand the type of market they�re in, whether they�ve achieved product-market fit and how to measure it, and what to do next. Fundraising Raising funds is one of the toughest but most important challenges for a Web3 startup that�s just getting off the ground. How much to raise, where to look for funds, what investors are looking for, and how to effectively showcase your startup�s potential are all important questions that Web3 founders should be asking�and the answers depend on the specific vertical, the stage of the startup, and more. The good news is that Web3 startups have more fundraising opportunities than ever before, from blockchain grants and crowdfunding options to traditional VC investment. This introductory post provides the context you need to set yourself up for fundraising success and put yourself in the shoes of an investor. Fundraising Resources Once you�ve read the article above, browse through this curated list of Web3 fundraising resources to understand the options that are out there for Web3 startups and choose the ones that are best for your startup�s goals. Marketing Marketing tactics are continuously evolving in Web3 as startups find new ways to attract and retain users.

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "In this technical tutorial, learn how to deploy smart contracts on the Solana blockchain that use Chainlink Price Feeds to access secure market data.\n\n",
    "content": "If you want to learn how to develop Solana smart contracts and programs, then you�ve come to the right place. Solana is an emerging high-performance, permissionless blockchain that offers fast, cheap, and scalable transactions and supports smart contracts being built with the Rust, C++, and C programming languages. In this technical article, we�ll go through examples of writing, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts on the Solana Devnet cluster, as well as how to use Chainlink Price Feeds in your Solana smart contracts. Solana�s Architecture and Programming Model Solana is a high-performance blockchain capable of thousands of transactions per second and sub-second block times. It achieves this via a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism that makes use of a new innovative cryptographic function called Proof of History. Proof of History Proof of History (PoH) establishes a cryptographically verifiable order of events (in this case transactions) over time via the use of a high-frequency verifiable delay function, or VDF. Essentially this means PoH is like a cryptographic clock that helps the network agree on time and ordering of events without having to wait to hear from other nodes. Much like how an ancient water clock can record the passage of time by observing rising water levels, Proof of History�s sequential outputs of constant hashed blockchain state give a verifiable order of events over time. This helps the performance of the network by allowing the ordered events to then be processed in parallel, as opposed to a traditional blockchain scenario where a single process verifies and bundles up all the transactions to be included in the next block. A simple analogy would be to imagine a large 100-piece puzzle. In a normal scenario it would take one or more people a certain amount of time to complete the puzzle. But imagine if beforehand the puzzle pieces were all stamped with a number corresponding to their position, from top left to bottom right of the puzzle, and laid out in a line in sequential order. Because the exact order of puzzle pieces and their position in the puzzle is known beforehand, the puzzle can be solved quicker by having multiple people focus on a section each. This is the effect that having a verifiable sequence of events over time has on the consensus mechanism; it allows the processing to be broken up into multiple parallel processes. Smart Contract Architecture Solana offers a different smart contract model to traditional EVM-based blockchains. In traditional EVM-based chains, contract code/logic and state are combined into a single contract deployed on-chain. With Solana, a smart contract (or program) is read-only or stateless and contains just program logic. Once deployed, smart contracts can be interacted with by external accounts. The accounts that interact with the programs store data related to program interaction. This creates a logical separation of state (accounts) and contract logic (programs). This is the crucial difference between Solana and EVM-based smart contracts. Accounts on Ethereum are not the same as accounts on Solana. Solana accounts can store data (including wallet information) as opposed to Ethereum accounts, which are references to people�s wallets. In addition to this, Solana offers a CLI and JSON RPC API that can be used by decentralized applications to interact with the Solana blockchain. They can also use one of the existing SDKs, which allow clients to talk to the blockchain and Solana programs. High-level representation of the Solana development workflow. Source: Solana documentation Deploying Your First Solana Smart Contract In this section, you�ll create and deploy your first �hello world� Solana program, written in Rust. Requirements The following should be installed before proceeding: NodeJS v14 or greater \u0026 NPM The latest stable Rust build Solana CLI v1.7.11 or later Git The HelloWorld Program The HelloWorld program is a smart contract that prints output to the console and counts the number of times the program has been called for a given account, storing the number on-chain. Let�s break down the code into separate sections. The first section defines some standard Solana program parameters and defines an entry point for the program (the �process_instruction� function). In addition to this, it uses borsh for serializing and deserializing parameters being passed to and from the deployed program. use borsh::{BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};\r\nuse solana_program::{\r\n    account_info::{next_account_info, AccountInfo},\r\n    entrypoint,\r\n    entrypoint::ProgramResult,\r\n    msg,\r\n    program_error::ProgramError,\r\n    pubkey::Pubkey,\r\n};\r\n\r\n/// Define the type of state stored in accounts\r\n#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Debug)]\r\npub struct GreetingAccount {\r\n    /// number of greetings\r\n    pub counter: u32,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Declare and export the program\u0027s entrypoint\r\nentrypoint!(process_instruction);\r\n The process_instruction function accepts the program_id, which is the public key where the program is deployed to, and accountInfo, which is the account to say hello to. pub fn process_instruction(\r\n    program_id: \u0026Pubkey, // Public key of the account the hello world program was loaded into\r\n    accounts: \u0026[AccountInfo], // The account to say hello to\r\n    _instruction_data: \u0026[u8], // Ignored, all helloworld instructions are hellos\r\n The ProgramResult is where the main logic of the program resides. In this case, it simply prints a message, then selects the accounts by looping through �accounts�. However, in our example there will only be one account.     ) -\u003e ProgramResult {\r\n    msg!(\"Hello World Rust program entrypoint\");\r\n\r\n    // Iterating accounts is safer then indexing\r\n    let accounts_iter \u003d \u0026mut accounts.iter();\r\n\r\n    // Get the account to say hello to\r\n    let account \u003d next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;\r\n Next, the program checks to see if the account has permission to modify the data for the specified account.     // The account must be owned by the program in order to modify its data\r\n    if account.owner !\u003d program_id {\r\n        msg!(\"Greeted account does not have the correct program id\");\r\n        return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId);\r\n    }\r\n Finally, the function takes the existing account�s stored number, increases the value by one, writes the result back, and displays a message.     // Increment and store the number of times the account has been greeted\r\n    let mut greeting_account \u003d GreetingAccount::try_from_slice(\u0026account.data.borrow())?;\r\n    greeting_account.counter +\u003d 1;\r\n    greeting_account.serialize(\u0026mut \u0026mut account.data.borrow_mut()[..])?;\r\n\r\n    msg!(\"Greeted {} time(s)!\", greeting_account.counter);\r\n\r\n    Ok(())\r\n Deploying the Program The first step is to clone the repository. git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld\r\ncd example-helloworld\r\n Once this is done, you can then set your current environment to devnet. This is the test network for Solana developers writing and testing smart contracts.  solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com\r\n Next, you need to create a new keypair for your account. This is required to interact with deployed programs (smart contracts) on the Solana devnet. Take note: this is an insecure method for storing keys and should only be used for demo purposes. You will be prompted to enter in a passphrase for security reasons.  solana-keygen new --force\r\n Now that you�ve created an account, you can use the airdrop program to obtain some SOL tokens. You will need some lamports (fractions of SOL tokens) to deploy your smart contract. This command requests SOL tokens into your newly generated account:  solana airdrop 2 \r\n You�re now ready to build the hello world program. You can build it by running the following command npm run build:program-rust\r\n Compiling the program Once the program has been built, you can then deploy it to devnet. The previous command�s output will give you the command that you need to run, but it should look something similar to the following:  solana program deploy dist/program/helloworld.so\r\n The end result is that you have successfully deployed the hello world program to devnet with an assigned program Id. This can then be checked on the Solana Devnet explorer. Deploying the program Viewing the deployed program on the Devnet explorer Interacting With the Deployed Program To interact with the deployed program, the hello-world repository contains a simple client. This client is written in Typescript using the Solana web3.js SDK and the Solana RPC API. The Client The client entry point is the main.ts file, which performs a number of tasks in a specific order, most of which are contained within the hello_world.ts file. First, the client establishes a connection with the cluster by calling the �establishConnection� function export async function establishConnection(): Promise {\r\n  const rpcUrl \u003d await getRpcUrl();\r\n  connection \u003d new Connection(rpcUrl, \u0027confirmed\u0027);\r\n  const version \u003d await connection.getVersion();\r\n  console.log(\u0027Connection to cluster established:\u0027, rpcUrl, version);\r\n}\r\n It then calls the �establishPayer� function to ensure there is an account available to pay for transactions, and creates one if required. export async function establishPayer(): Promise {\r\n  let fees \u003d 0;\r\n  if (!payer) {\r\n    const {feeCalculator} \u003d await connection.getRecentBlockhash();\r\n\r\n    // Calculate the cost to fund the greeter account\r\n    fees +\u003d await connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(GREETING_SIZE);\r\n\r\n    // Calculate the cost of sending transactions\r\n    fees +\u003d feeCalculator.lamportsPerSignature * 100; // wag\r\n\r\n    payer \u003d await getPayer();\r\n  }\r\n The client then calls the �checkProgram� function, which loads the keypair of the deployed program from ./dist/program/helloworld-keypair.json and uses the public key for the keypair to fetch the program account. If the program doesn�t exist, the client stops with an error. If the program does exist, it will create a new account with the program assigned as its owner to store the program state, which in this case is the number of times the program has been executed.  export async function checkProgram(): Promise {\r\n  // Read program id from keypair file\r\n  try {\r\n    const programKeypair \u003d await createKeypairFromFile(PROGRAM_KEYPAIR_PATH);\r\n    programId \u003d programKeypair.publicKey;\r\n  } catch (err) {\r\n    const errMsg \u003d (err as Error).message;\r\n    throw new Error(\r\n      `Failed to read program keypair at \u0027${PROGRAM_KEYPAIR_PATH}\u0027 due to error: ${errMsg}. Program may need to be deployed with \\`solana program deploy dist/program/helloworld.so\\``,\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Check if the program has been deployed\r\n  const programInfo \u003d await connection.getAccountInfo(programId);\r\n  if (programInfo \u003d\u003d\u003d null) {\r\n    if (fs.existsSync(PROGRAM_SO_PATH)) {\r\n      throw new Error(\r\n        \u0027Program needs to be deployed with `solana program deploy dist/program/helloworld.so`\u0027,\r\n      );\r\n    } else {\r\n      throw new Error(\u0027Program needs to be built and deployed\u0027);\r\n    }\r\n  } else if (!programInfo.executable) {\r\n    throw new Error(`Program is not executable`);\r\n  }\r\n  console.log(`Using program ${programId.toBase58()}`);\r\n\r\n  // Derive the address (public key) of a greeting account from the program so that it\u0027s easy to find later.\r\n  const GREETING_SEED \u003d \u0027hello\u0027;\r\n  greetedPubkey \u003d await PublicKey.createWithSeed(\r\n    payer.publicKey,\r\n    GREETING_SEED,\r\n    programId,\r\n  );\r\n The client then builds up and sends a �hello� transaction to the program by calling the �sayHello� function. The transaction contains an instruction that holds the public key of the helloworld program account to call, and the account to which the client wishes to say hello to. Each time the client performs this transaction to an account, the program increments a count in the destination account�s data storage.  \r\n  export async function sayHello(): Promise {\r\n  console.log(\u0027Saying hello to\u0027, greetedPubkey.toBase58());\r\n  const instruction \u003d new TransactionInstruction({\r\n    keys: [{pubkey: greetedPubkey, isSigner: false, isWritable: true}],\r\n    programId,\r\n    data: Buffer.alloc(0), // All instructions are hellos\r\n  });\r\n  await sendAndConfirmTransaction(\r\n    connection,\r\n    new Transaction().add(instruction),\r\n    [payer],\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n Finally, the client queries the account�s data to retrieve the current number of times the account has had the sayHello transaction called, by calling �reportGreetings�  export async function reportGreetings(): Promise {\r\n  const accountInfo \u003d await connection.getAccountInfo(greetedPubkey);\r\n  if (accountInfo \u003d\u003d\u003d null) {\r\n    throw \u0027Error: cannot find the greeted account\u0027;\r\n  }\r\n  const greeting \u003d borsh.deserialize(\r\n    GreetingSchema,\r\n    GreetingAccount,\r\n    accountInfo.data,\r\n  );\r\n  console.log(\r\n    greetedPubkey.toBase58(),\r\n    \u0027has been greeted\u0027,\r\n    greeting.counter,\r\n    \u0027time(s)\u0027,\r\n  );\r\n Running the Client Before you can run the client to read data from your deployed program, you need to install the client dependencies. npm install\r\n Once this is done, you can start the client. npm run start\r\n You should see output showing your program successfully being executed, and it should display the number of times the account has been greeted. Subsequent runs should increase this number. Starting the Hello World client to interact with the deployed program Congratulations, you�ve deployed and interacted with a Solana smart contract on the devnet network! Now we�ll dive into another example Solana program and client, except this time we�ll make use of Chainlink Price Feeds. Chainlink Price Feeds on Solana The ecosystem of DeFi apps on Solana is growing at an accelerating rate. In order to power basic DeFi mechanisms and execute key on-chain functions, such as issuing loans at fair market prices or liquidating undercollateralized positions, these dApps need access to highly reliable and high-quality market data. Solana has integrated Chainlink Price Feeds on the Solana Devnet, offering developers highly decentralized, high-quality, high-speed price reference data updates for building hybrid smart contracts. When combined with Solana�s ability to support up to 65,000 transactions per second and its extremely low transaction fees, Chainlink Price Feeds have the potential to empower DeFi protocol infrastructure that can compete with traditional financial systems in terms of trade execution and risk management quality. In this next code example, we�ll deploy and interact with a Solana program that makes use of Chainlink Price Feeds on the Solana devnet cluster. Requirements NodeJS v14 or greater \u0026 NPM The latest stable Rust build Solana CLI v1.7.11 or later Git The Chainlink Solana Starter Kit The Solana Starter Kit is a pre-packaged repository that contains a smart contract that simply connects to a Chainlink Price Feed account on devnet, and retrieves and stores the latest price of the specified price pair into an account, which is then read by an off-chain client. The starter kit uses the Anchor framework, a framework that helps abstract some of the complexities with building smart contracts on Solana. Chainlink Price Feeds on Solana all utilize a single program, with each individual price feed being a separate account that stores price updates using the program. The way this demo works is an off-chain client passes in an account to the on-chain program, the on-chain program then obtains the latest price for the specified price feed, and stores the value in the passed in account. Finally, the off-chain client then reads the price data from the account. The first section of the the smart contract consists of normal includes and declaring using the Anchor framework. It also declares the program ID as required by Anchor. In addition to this, a struct is defined for storing price feed answers into the passed in account, as well as a `fmt` function for formatting the price data retrieved. use anchor_lang::prelude::*;\r\nuse anchor_lang::solana_program::system_program;\r\n\r\nuse chainlink_solana as chainlink;\r\n\r\ndeclare_id!(\"JC16qi56dgcLoaTVe4BvnCoDL6FhH5NtahA7jmWZFdqm\");\r\n\r\n#[account]\r\npub struct Decimal {\r\n    pub value: i128,\r\n    pub decimals: u32,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Decimal {\r\n    pub fn new(value: i128, decimals: u32) -\u003e Self {\r\n        Decimal { value, decimals }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl std::fmt::Display for Decimal {\r\n    fn fmt(\u0026self, f: \u0026mut std::fmt::Formatter\u003c\u0027_\u003e) -\u003e std::fmt::Result {\r\n        let mut scaled_val \u003d self.value.to_string();\r\n        if scaled_val.len() \u003c\u003d self.decimals as usize {\r\n            scaled_val.insert_str(\r\n                0,\r\n                \u0026vec![\"0\"; self.decimals as usize - scaled_val.len()].join(\"\"),\r\n            );\r\n            scaled_val.insert_str(0, \"0.\");\r\n        } else {\r\n            scaled_val.insert(scaled_val.len() - self.decimals as usize, \u0027.\u0027);\r\n        }\r\n        f.write_str(\u0026scaled_val)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n Next, the program declares a `chainlink_solana_demo` module to be used for obtaining price data, which contains the `execute` function. The `execute` function is the part of the program that contains the main logic for the smart contract. It retrieves the latest round data from the specified feed address by calling the `latest_round_data` function from the chainlink-solana package, which gets imported from GitHub via the Cargo.toml file. The function finishes by formatting and storing the price against the specified account passed into the program, and writing the result out to the program output. #[program]\r\npub mod chainlink_solana_demo {\r\n    use super::*;\r\n        pub fn execute(ctx: Context) -\u003e ProgramResult  {\r\n        let round \u003d chainlink::latest_round_data(\r\n            ctx.accounts.chainlink_program.to_account_info(),\r\n            ctx.accounts.chainlink_feed.to_account_info(),\r\n        )?;\r\n\r\n        let description \u003d chainlink::description(\r\n            ctx.accounts.chainlink_program.to_account_info(),\r\n            ctx.accounts.chainlink_feed.to_account_info(),\r\n        )?;\r\n\r\n        let decimals \u003d chainlink::decimals(\r\n            ctx.accounts.chainlink_program.to_account_info(),\r\n            ctx.accounts.chainlink_feed.to_account_info(),\r\n        )?;\r\n\r\n        // Set the account value\r\n        let decimal: \u0026mut Account \u003d \u0026mut ctx.accounts.decimal;\r\n        decimal.value\u003dround.answer;\r\n        decimal.decimals\u003du32::from(decimals);\r\n\r\n        // Also print the value to the program output\r\n        let decimal_print \u003d Decimal::new(round.answer, u32::from(decimals));\r\n        msg!(\"{} price is {}\", description, decimal_print);\r\n        Ok(())\r\n    }\r\n Deploying the Program The first step is to clone the repository. git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/solana-starter-kit\r\ncd solana-starter-kit\r\n Once this is done, you can install the required dependencies, including the Anchor framework. npm install\r\n Note for Apple M1 chipsets: You will need to perform an extra step to get the Anchor framework installed manually from source, as the NPM package only support x86_64 chipsets currently, please run the following command to install it manually: cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --tag v0.20.1 anchor-cli --locked Next, you need to create a new keypair for your account. This is required to interact with deployed programs (smart contracts) on the Solana devnet cluster. Again, this is an insecure method for storing keys, and should only be used for demo purposes. You will be prompted to enter a passphrase for security reasons. solana-keygen new -o id.json\r\n Now that you�ve created an account, you can use the airdrop program to obtain some SOL tokens. You will need some lamports (fractions of SOL tokens) to deploy your program. This command requests SOL tokens for your newly generated account. We will need to call this twice, because the Devnet faucet is limited to 2 SOL, and we need approximately 4 SOL. solana airdrop 2 $(solana-keygen pubkey ./id.json) --url https://api.devnet.solana.com \u0026\u0026 solana airdrop 2 $(solana-keygen pubkey ./id.json) --url https://api.devnet.solana.com\r\n You�re now ready to build the Chainlink Solana Demo program using the Anchor framework! anchor build\r\n Building the program with Anchor The build process generates the keypair for your program�s account. Before you deploy your program, you must add this public key to your lib.rs file, as it�s it�s required by programs that make use of Anchor. To do this, you need to get the keypair from the ./target/deploy/chainlink_solana_demo-keypair.json file that Anchor generated using the following command: solana address -k ./target/deploy/chainlink_solana_demo-keypair.json\r\n The next step is to edit the lib.rs file and replace the keypair in the declare_id!() definition with the value you obtained from the previous step: declare_id!(\"JC16qi56dgcLoaTVe4BvnCoDL6FhH5NtahA7jmWZFdqm\"); Next, you also need to insert the obtained Program ID value into the Anchor.toml file in the chainlink_solana_demo devnet definition [programs.devnet]\r\nchainlink_solana_demo \u003d \"JC16qi56dgcLoaTVe4BvnCoDL6FhH5NtahA7jmWZFdqm\"\r\n Finally, because you updated the source code with the generated program ID, you need to rebuild the program again, and then it can be deployed to devnet anchor build\r\nanchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet\r\n Deploying the program with Anchor Once you have successfully deployed the program, the terminal output will specify the program ID of the program, it should match the value you inserted into the lib.rs file and the Anchor.toml file. Once again, take note of this Program ID, as it will be required when executing the client. This can then be checked on the Solana Devnet explorer. Viewing the deployed program on the Solana Devnet explorer Interacting With the Deployed Program To interact with the deployed program, the Chainlink Solana Demo repository contains a client written in JavaScript using the Anchor framework and the Solana web3 API. The Client The client is a JavaScript script that takes two parameters, a deployed program ID, and a Price Feed account address. It then creates a connection to the deployed program and passes in the specified price feed account and an account to store the retrieved price data. Once the on-chain program execution has completed, it simply reads the price data from the account that was passed into the program. First, the client establishes a connection with the cluster using Anchor and sets up some required parameters, such as pulling in command line arguments and setting of default values: const args \u003d require(\u0027minimist\u0027)(process.argv.slice(2));\r\n\r\n// Initialize Anchor and provider\r\nconst anchor \u003d require(\"@project-serum/anchor\");\r\nconst provider \u003d anchor.Provider.env();\r\n// Configure the cluster.\r\nanchor.setProvider(provider);\r\n\r\nconst CHAINLINK_PROGRAM_ID \u003d \"HEvSKofvBgfaexv23kMabbYqxasxU3mQ4ibBMEmJWHny\";\r\nconst DIVISOR \u003d 100000000;\r\n\r\n// Data feed account address\r\n// Default is SOL / USD\r\nconst default_feed \u003d \"HgTtcbcmp5BeThax5AU8vg4VwK79qAvAKKFMs8txMLW6\";\r\nconst CHAINLINK_FEED \u003d args[\u0027feed\u0027] || default_feed;\r\n After this, the main function of the client is defined. This is the function that does everything described above. First, it connects to our deployed program using the Anchor framework. It then generates a new account and calls the `execute` function in the deployed program, passing in the following details: The account created to store the price data The account of the user running the client (to pay transaction fees) The specified price feed account address The program ID of the Chainlink Price Feeds on devnet. This is a static value that doesn�t need to be modified The Solana system program account address. Once again, this value is static async function main() {\r\n  // Read the generated IDL.\r\n  const idl \u003d JSON.parse(\r\n    require(\"fs\").readFileSync(\"./target/idl/chainlink_solana_demo.json\", \"utf8\")\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  // Address of the deployed program.\r\n  const programId \u003d new anchor.web3.PublicKey(args[\u0027program\u0027]);\r\n\r\n  // Generate the program client from IDL.\r\n  const program \u003d new anchor.Program(idl, programId);\r\n\r\n  //create an account to store the price data\r\n  const priceFeedAccount \u003d anchor.web3.Keypair.generate();\r\n\r\n  console.log(\u0027priceFeedAccount public key: \u0027 + priceFeedAccount.publicKey);\r\n  console.log(\u0027user public key: \u0027 + provider.wallet.publicKey);\r\n\r\n  // Execute the RPC.\r\n  let tx \u003d await program.rpc.execute({\r\n    accounts: {\r\n      decimal: priceFeedAccount.publicKey,\r\n      user: provider.wallet.publicKey,\r\n      chainlinkFeed: CHAINLINK_FEED,\r\n      chainlinkProgram: CHAINLINK_PROGRAM_ID,\r\n      systemProgram: anchor.web3.SystemProgram.programId\r\n    },\r\n    options: { commitment: \"confirmed\" },\r\n    signers: [priceFeedAccount],\r\n  });\r\n The client then waits to get a confirmed transaction and then outputs the program output onto the console. This displays information about the transaction, including the printed output from the on-chain program. Finally, the program reads the price data from the priceFeed account that was passed into the program, and then outputs the value to the console. console.log(\"Fetching transaction logs...\");\r\n  let t \u003d await provider.connection.getConfirmedTransaction(tx, \"confirmed\");\r\n  console.log(t.meta.logMessages);\r\n  // #endregion main\r\n\r\n  // Fetch the account details of the account containing the price data\r\n  const latestPrice \u003d await program.account.decimal.fetch(priceFeedAccount.publicKey);\r\n  console.log(\u0027Price Is: \u0027 + latestPrice.value / DIVISOR)\r\n Running the Client The first step is to set the Anchor environment variables. These are required by the Anchor framework to determine which Provider to use, as well as which Wallet to use for interacting with the deployed program. In this case, we�re setting the value to the default devnet provider URL, and the wallet that we created earlier: export ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL\u003d\u0027https://api.devnet.solana.com\u0027\r\nexport ANCHOR_WALLET\u003d\u0027./id.json\u0027\r\n Once this is done, we are ready to run the JavaScript client. Be sure to pass the program ID obtained from the previous steps by using the �program flag linking to the json file containing the account that owns the program. We also need to pass in the Chainlink feed address that we wish to query. This can be taken from the Chainlink Solana Feeds page, and the value will be defaulted to the devnet SOL/USD feed address if you don�t specify a value. In this example, we�re explicitly specifying the SOL/USD feed to show how the feed parameter works: node client.js --program $(solana address -k ./target/deploy/chainlink_solana_demo-keypair.json) -�feed  HgTtcbcmp5BeThax5AU8vg4VwK79qAvAKKFMs8txMLW6\r\n You should see output showing the client successfully being executed, and it should display the latest price from the specified price feed, stored in the new account: Executing the client Summary Solana offers a high-speed, low-cost, scalable blockchain for building smart contracts and decentralized applications. By leveraging Solana smart contracts and Chainlink Price Feeds, developers can create fast, scalable DeFi applications, taking advantage of the high-quality data offered by Chainlink Price Feeds and the high-speed updates available on the Solana blockchain.

    "content": "Special thanks to Adrian Hetman, Alejandro Munoz-McDonald, Ivan Benavides, and Leon Spacewalker. Hunting for smart contract bugs can be a ludicrously well-paying job, and it�s also an integral part of protecting the ecosystem from hacks. I recently had the pleasure of interviewing a developer who found a $7 billion dollar bug�and was paid $2.2M for reporting it. In this blog, we�re going to go through the bug that this developer found and how it had the potential to compromise $7b in value before offering some strategies and tools that will help you find bugs. Let�s dive in. Polygon Smart Contract Bug Example Build Up On May 31, 2020, the Matic blockchain went live (Matic would later be rebranded as Polygon). Polygon is an EVM-compatible blockchain known for it�s low gas fees and short block time. The chain has recently begun exploring zk-rollup technology. If you take a look at block 0 of Polygon, the absolute first block of the blockchain, also known as its �genesis� block, you�ll see 10 transactions. One of these transactions created a contract called MRC20. Polygon genesis block. What is this contract? When we send a native blockchain token we have to spend gas to do so. So the Polygon team deployed a contract that allows you to sign a transaction to send someone ETH, with someone else able to pay the gas fee for this transaction. Known as a �meta transaction,� this capability was popularized with the introduction of EIP-712. You can see that this contract was given almost 10 billion MATIC tokens in order to help facilitate these gasless transactions. However, this clever contract contained a vulnerability that could have potentially been exploited to drain the entire balance! On December 3rd, 2021 the hero of the story, pseudo-anon developer Leon Spacewalker, submitted a report to the Immunefi bug bounty program laying out the details of this exact function. A second hero, who we will just call Whitehat2, also reported the vulnerability a day later. Around 800,000 MATIC tokens were stolen before the chain was finally forked, rolled back, and fixed December 5th, 2021. This leaves us with some more questions: What was the vulnerability? How did it stay undiscovered for so long? How was it found? The Exploit Below is the function that facilitates these gasless transactions.    function transferWithSig(\r\n       bytes calldata sig,\r\n       uint256 amount,\r\n       bytes32 data,\r\n       uint256 expiration,\r\n       address to\r\n   ) external returns (address from) {\r\n       require(amount \u003e 0);\r\n       require(\r\n           expiration \u003d\u003d 0 || block.number \u003c\u003d expiration,\r\n           \"Signature is expired\"\r\n       );\r\n\r\n       bytes32 dataHash \u003d getTokenTransferOrderHash(\r\n           msg.sender,\r\n           amount,\r\n           data,\r\n           expiration\r\n       );\r\n       require(disabledHashes[dataHash] \u003d\u003d false, \"Sig deactivated\");\r\n       disabledHashes[dataHash] \u003d true;\r\n\r\n       from \u003d ecrecovery(dataHash, sig);\r\n\r\n       _transferFrom(from, address(uint160(to)), amount);\r\n   } At first glance, it seems harmless: It takes the signature of the user, how many tokens and who they want to send them to, and any further data, along with an expiration date for the transaction. It runs some requires, gets the data hash in order to send the meta transaction, makes sure the data hash hasn�t been used, and does this ecrecovery function. This function is essentially a wrapper for the Solidity ecrecover function. Solidity ecrecover function wrapper. This function is how we can verify where signed transactions are coming from. You�ll notice, even in the Solidity documentation, it says it will �return zero on error�. The ecrecovery function copied this, and if it had an issue, it would return 0. Which, as many developers know, can be scary. If it returns zero on error, that means that we should check to make sure that the returned address isn�t zero, right? Here�s the actual code: Here�s what should probably be there: So we don�t perform a check on the address to make sure it didn�t result in an error. Not a problem. The last line of code in our transferWithSig function does the actual transfer, surely we will perform some sort of check there, right? function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)\r\n   internal\r\n{\r\n   require(recipient !\u003d address(this), \"can\u0027t send to MRC20\");\r\n   address(uint160(recipient)).transfer(amount); // It just sends the money!\r\n   emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);\r\n} The _transferFrom function just called our _transfer function, shown above. You�ll notice it doesn�t check to make sure the from address has enough money. This means that someone could send an invalid signature, which would result in a zero address returned from ecrecovery, but the MRC20 contract would still send the to address an amount of money. This is how that 9,999,993,000 MATIC could be drained, since the MRC20 contract sends the money directly from itself! A check to make sure that the from address has enough money for this signed transaction would have prevented this issue. How Did the Smart Contract Bug Elude Discovery for So Long? What�s odd to me is that, after the vulnerability laying dormant for almost a year and a half, it was discovered by Leon, another white hat, and a hacker within the span of a few days. Seems fishy. But the Immunefi team told me this can often happen. Some exploits can become popular based on an article, write-up, or challenge and people then start looking for that vulnerability, resulting in several people finding it at the same time. But more likely is that it turns out that polygon verified the contract on Polygonscan around this time � so that was when people really started to look at it. Maybe there is more to the story, but maybe not. In any case, let�s use this bug as a teachable moment and look at some of the skills Leon and other bug hunters use to find bugs, helping protect the Web3 ecosystem. Top 7 Strategies Now, we are going to learn the skills Leon and other bug hunters use to find these vulnerabilities and claim bug bounties. This list of tips assumes you already know the basics of smart contracts, so yes, learning Solidity is a prerequisite. Use these superpowers for ethical hacking, and please remember to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find. A lot of the work of finding vulnerabilities comes from looking at the code and running tools like slither. For this $2.2M payout, Leon said he was able to find the bug by looking line-by-line at the smart contract code, so remember, finding vulnerabilities is often a huge manual lift! In addition to the practical tips below, Leon�s biggest takeaway was for smart contract bug hunters to �find your edge,� but what does he mean by that? Typically, this means finding that thing that sets you apart from other hackers. We as a community need to cover every corner of the smart contract space, so find a section that you are specifically good at and excel. Here are the seven strategies and tips to help find your edge, to make you a successful smart contract bug hunter. 1. Find a Project and Search For Bugs The first way you can find bugs is to know every inch of how a protocol works. This is one of the first skills every smart contract bug hunter needs to be learn: the ability to understand a protocol end to end. Go through docs, try to reimplement a protocol yourself, and view transactions through that protocol on a block explorer. Leon said this strategy works for other hunters but not him. He focuses on the next three, but it�s important for every bug hunter to be able to do this. 2. Find a Bug and Search For Projects An easier approach to hunting for bugs is to find a bug that not a lot of people know about and try to see which protocols have implemented it. This strategy takes a lot of research, as there are a lot of people working on exposing bugs to the general public. You first need to understand all the basic smart contract exploits, and then their advanced versions. You need to be aware of best practices and see if there are protocols that have not followed them. Once you find a smart contract bug you think a lot of projects might not have protected against, start searching for that bug. Get really familiar with this new bug and how to find it. And be sure to write a blog or some kind of post to help other smart contract developers who run into this bug protect themselves. 3. Be Fast Projects that want bug hunters to look at their smart contracts need to sign up for bug bounty programs like Immunefi. And you�ll want to be one of the first developers to find the new bounties. If you start looking at a contract before other hunters, you�ll have more time to find a bug than other hunters. There are a few ways to be fast�one of the ways Leon was able to find the smart contract vulnerability before others was by having notifications on for the Immunifi updates Discord channel. He received a notification anytime a new project came in, or a project was updated. Tools like this can help you get to digging into code before anyone else does. 4. Be Creative Another way Leon was able to get an edge, was traversing community forums, and finding out they were thinking about submitting a bug. He�d then start looking at the smart contracts even before the bounty was approved. This gave him way more time to look at a contract than other developers, since they would wait for a bug bounty to be submitted. 5. Know Your Tooling Bug hunters use tools like the VSCode Solidity visual developer extension, Hardhat, Foundry, Brownie, Dune, Etherscan, plus a host of others. A typical bug hunting strategy might be loading up VSCode, adding the code to VSCode with the Solidity visual extension, and going line by line looking for common bugs or bad best practices. After finding a weakness, setting up a testing environment to run tests on the contract is a good next step. You can often reuse a lot of the tests the developers of the protocol originally used. 6. Don�t Be Afraid of Audited Projects Not much else to say here. Audit firms make mistakes. Many of the projects Leon found vulnerabilities for had been audited by top firms. Using the skills we talked about in this blog can be the difference for you to find these issues! 7. Industry-Specific Knowledge One of the biggest advantages in finding your edge is specializing in a specific niche. If you understand one area incredibly well, you�ll have the advantage of knowing how all the functions interact with each other. If you�re a phenomenal smart contract vulnerability expert but don�t know anything about DeFi, it�ll be hard to find vulnerabilities in DeFi contracts. For example, a lot of developers understand code, but don�t understand financial primitives. You could get incredibly good at understanding decentralized exchanges, borrowing protocols, or maybe just NFTs! If you can become a master of security and a master of a certain vertical within Web3, you�ll be well-positioned to have a massive leg up on everyone else looking for bugs. Summary I hope this piece is useful to you in your smart contract bug-hunting journey.

And, as always, I hope to see you out there building and keeping the ecosystem a little safer. Links MRC20 contract. Immunefi writeup. Change to Polygon contracts. Previous Polygon contracts.

    "content": "The beauty of the new decentralized vision for the Internet called Web3 is the ability for anyone to interact with smart contracts deployed on a general-purpose blockchain. As you may already know, smart contracts are computer programs that run on blockchains whose source code is publicly available for anyone to verify, and, as said, anyone can interact with them without the need for a web-based interface. This can be done by running a blockchain client and creating transactions using a command-line interface (CLI). The middle ground between web or mobile applications and a CLI for interacting with smart contracts would be Etherscan�a block explorer for various blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and many more. If you are curious about how to interact with a smart contract on Etherscan, check out this recent blog post about reading a smart contract on Etherscan. With that said, we can only interact with �verified� smart contracts on Etherscan. In this technical tutorial, you will learn how to verify smart contracts on Etherscan. Verification of Single Solidity Files To start with the verification process, we need to first deploy the smart contract. Navigate to Remix IDE and create a new file called �Counter.sol�. Paste the following code: // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\ncontract Counter {\r\n ���uint256 internal counter;\r\n ���function increment() external {\r\n �������unchecked {\r\n �����������++counter;\r\n �������}\r\n ���}\r\n\r\n ���function getCurrent() external view returns(uint256) {\r\n �������return counter;\r\n ���}\r\n} Before deployment, we must pay attention to the version of the Solidity compiler we used for compiling this contract, as well as the contract�s license which is provided at the top of the file as �SPDX-License-Identifier�. We specified inside the contract file that it can be compiled with any Solidity compiler version between 0.8.0 and 0.9.0, which contains multiple versions such as 0.8.0, 0.8.1, 0.8.2, etc. Go to the �Solidity Compiler� tab, select the Solidity compiler version (remember, it can be any 0.8 version), and click �Compile Counter.sol�. For this example, we will use the 0.8.7 compiler version. After successful compilation, navigate to the �Deploy \u0026 Run Transactions� tab just below the current one. From the �Environment� dropdown, select �Injected Provider � Metamask�, which will automatically display a MetaMask popup to connect your wallet to the Remix IDE website. After that, select the blockchain network you want to deploy your contract to inside your wallet. We will deploy this contract to Rinkeby, therefore we need to select �Rinkeby Test Network� inside our MetaMask wallet. To deploy the contract, we will also need some amount of Test Rinkeby ether. You can grab some for free from the Chainlink Faucet simply by connecting your wallet to the faucet. Make sure that the selected network at the upper right corner dropdown is Ethereum Rinkeby. Finally, click the orange �Deploy� button and sign the transaction inside the MetaMask wallet. Wait approximately 15 seconds until your transaction is confirmed. You can now interact with your smart contract through the Remix IDE UI, but that�s not the point since we want to allow anyone to use it. If we track our contract on Etherscan, simply by either tracking the last transaction hash or by pasting the contract�s address into Etherscan�s search bar, we will see only the contract�s bytecode when clicking the Contract tab. This means that we need to �verify� our smart contract on Etherscan in order to use it via this block explorer. To start the verification process, click the �Verify and Publish� blue hyperlinked text. The following page will show up. Enter your contract address into the first input field if it isn�t populated by default already. Then from the �Compiler Type� dropdown, select �Solidity (Single File)�. After that, the �Compiler Version� dropdown will show up. Here we need to select the same Solidity compiler version we used for compiling this smart contract before the deployment�in our case, that was the 0.8.7 version. Finally, from the �Open Source License Type� dropdown, select the license specified at the beginning of the Solidity file as �SPDX-License-Identifier�. In our case, that�s MIT. Click Continue to go to the next page. Paste the contract�s source code into the �Enter the Solidity Contract Code below� input box, solve the Captcha, and click the blue �Verify and Publish� button. You should be able to see the green checkmark on the Contract tab now. This means that the contract is verified and that we can now interact with it. If you click the �Read Contract� button, you should be able to call the �getCurrent� function and see the current value of our counter variable, which is zero by default. If you click the �Write Contract� button, you should be able to connect your wallet to the Etherscan website and call our �increment� function. After clicking the button, MetaMask will pop up to sign the transaction (remember that you need to be on the Rinkeby network). After your transaction has been successfully included in a block, you can go back to the �Read Contract� section and call the �getCurrent� function again to validate that the �counter� value is now 1. Verification of Multiple Solidity Files Using Flattener Plugin We just saw how the verification process for smart contracts works on Etherscan. The example showed us how it can be done for a single Solidity file, which is not always the case. In reality, your smart contract will often import other contracts, interfaces, or libraries. Let�s use the Chainlink Price Feed Consumer contract as an example. Create a new Solidity file, name it �PriceFeedConsumer.sol�, and paste the following code from the official Chainlink documentation: // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.7;\r\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract PriceConsumerV3 {\r\n ���AggregatorV3Interface internal priceFeed;\r\n ���/**\r\n ����* Network: Rinkeby\r\n ����* Aggregator: ETH/USD\r\n ����* Address: 0x8A753747A1Fa494EC906cE90E9f37563A8AF630e\r\n�����*/\r\n\r\n ���constructor() {\r\n �������priceFeed \u003d \r\nAggregatorV3Interface(0x8A753747A1Fa494EC906cE90E9f37563A8AF630e);\r\n ���}\r\n\r\n ���/**\r\n ����* Returns the latest price\r\n ����*/\r\n\r\n ���function getLatestPrice() public view returns (int) {\r\n �������(\r\n �����������/*uint80 roundID*/,\r\n �����������int price,\r\n �����������/*uint startedAt*/,\r\n �����������/*uint timeStamp*/,\r\n �����������/*uint80 answeredInRound*/\r\n\r\n �������) \u003d priceFeed.latestRoundData();\r\n �������return price;\r\n ���}\r\n} Line �import �@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol�;� means that we are importing the Solidity interface from another file. Interfaces are not smart contracts per se, rather they are used to list related methods without a function body implemented. Interfaces are declared by the �interface� keyword. Interfaces can be used to either be inherited by a smart contract that will implement all of the listed methods, or for calling methods of some other contract which have implemented those listed functions. In this example, we are using the latter example to call the �latestRoundData� function on the Chainlink Aggregator contract. Let�s deploy this contract with the 0.8.7 Solidity Compiler version again. The license is MIT again, which we can see from the first line of our smart contract. After the successful deployment, navigate back to the Remix IDE file explorer. Find �PriceFeedConsumer.sol�, right-click it, and then click �Flatten�. This command will generate the new file called �PriceFeedConsumer_flat.sol� and replace all of the imports with the source code of the actually imported contracts, interfaces, or libraries. Notice the Remix IDE �Flattener� extension, which automatically activates. The second way to flatten the contract is to activate this extension by clicking the �Extensions� button in the bottom left corner (above the �Settings� button, looks like an electric plug) and clicking the green �Activate� button next to the �Flattener� extension. Then, go to the Flattener extension tab and click the �Flatten PriceFeedConsumer.sol� button. Note that this action won�t create the new file, rather it will copy the flattened source code to the clipboard so we can just paste it to the Etherscan verification page. It�s up to you which of those two approaches for flattening you will choose. Now, when you go to the Etherscan verification page, as described in the previous chapter, select: For Compiler Type � Solidity (Single File) For Compiler Version�- v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7 For Open Source License Type � MIT License (MIT) And then click the �Continue� button. On the following page, inside the �Enter the Solidity Contract Code below� text box, paste the content of either the �PriceFeedConsumer_flat.sol� file or the clipboard, depending on the method you used for flattening the contract. Again, solve the Captcha and click the �Verify and Publish� button. Verification of Multiple Solidity Files Using Etherscan Plugin An alternative method for the verification of contracts consisting of multiple Solidity files would be using the �Etherscan � Contract Verification� Remix IDE plugin. We will use the already written �PriceFeedConsumer.sol� contract. Deploy it once again. After that, activate the �Etherscan � Contract Verification� plugin from the Extensions tab. Now go to Etherscan and sign up for an account. Under your account settings, find the �API Keys� section. Generate one API key using the Free Plan. Then, navigate back to the Remix IDE, click the �Etherscan � Contract Verification� tab and paste your API key there. Click the �Save API key� button. Then, select the contract you want to verify and provide its contract address. Hit �Verify Contract�. That�s it, your contract should now be verified on Etherscan.

    "content": "Definition: The verifiable web uses blockchain technology, decentralized computing, and cryptography to enforce contractual obligations, provide greater transparency into how systems work, and give users more control over their data, identities, and assets. In early civilizations, truth was based on myth. Observations of worldly phenomena were wrapped in symbolic narratives, religious beliefs, and ancient wisdom. Over time, humanity began to value objective measurements and reasoning, birthing disciplines such as science, mathematics, and logic. After the invention of the written word and, later, the printing press, books and documents captured the world�s information in written form, from academic literature and legal contracts to statistics and opinionated analysis. Then, in the twentieth century, phones, computers, and the Internet started a digital revolution in how information was created, distributed, and verified, with supercomputers now performing large-scale computations on complex data sets and billions of users across the globe generating, sharing, and talking about content every day in real-time. Now, with a simple Internet connection, anyone in the world can instantly access a seemingly infinite flow of information. But while individuals are now empowered to consume and share more information than ever before, high-velocity, high-volume information scattered across a variety of applications poses extraordinary challenges: How can an everyday user make sense of such a vast, complex, and sometimes contradictory information landscape? Information warfare and advancements in AI are only compounding this problem. Information is the basis for sound decision-making by humans, institutions, and systems, and we need a better foundation for obtaining and evaluating it. This new foundation starts by increasing people�s ability to verify the source of information, the method used to calculate it and the integrity of the systems used to do so, and the historical reputation of these sources, methods, and systems. Doing so will require the creation of a more advanced informational and digital age powered by cryptographic truth. We call this the verifiable web. The evolution of truth. What Is the Verifiable Web? The Web Is Flawed In the established web model, the Internet is shared networking infrastructure that enables communication between computers via online applications. Each online application handles its own computing (executing code), storage (storing code and data used and produced), and management (updating code and maintaining a successful business) by either running it in-house or outsourcing it to a centralized company. Users of applications are then responsible for establishing a connection to the Internet in order to interact with the online application, generally by paying for a data or Internet plan. The problem with this model is it directly or indirectly gives centralized entities� whether it�s the application or Internet Service Provider (ISP)�extensive control over online data, computing, and/or networking. This means how the application works can be arbitrarily changed at any time�a social media company quietly changing its algorithm, for example. It also means that user data and connectivity can be arbitrarily censored, omitted, or monetized for personal gain, oftentimes with little user oversight or awareness of how it�s being done. As a result, the user has to trust the application and Internet infrastructure to act in a reliable and honest manner because they have no actual guarantees�just paper promises that take time and money to fight against in court if broken (assuming the user even has access to a high-integrity legal system). With the web extending far beyond information-sharing applications to span financial transactions, health management, election systems, supply chain tracking, and more, fixing it means fixing the nature of almost every digital interaction the modern user has. The stakes couldn�t be higher. A Verification Layer for the Internet The verifiable web is not a replacement for the established web but rather an extension of its capabilities. The verifiable web provides applications with a decentralized, cryptographically secure, and verifiably fair environment for running computations, storing data, governing operations, and facilitating networking across systems. With some or all of an application�s backend infrastructure run on the verifiable web, users are able to obtain proof and guarantees about the application and its data, such as that it�s manipulation-resistant (secure), always available (reliable), permissionlessly accessible (censorship-resistant), logically sound (accurate), authenticated (genuine), private (privacy), and traceable from inception (provenance). Instead of requiring users to trust that an online application will keep its commitments, the verifiable web provides technologically enforced guarantees that users can independently check. By knowing how an application works and that it cannot arbitrarily change, users can make more informed decisions about whether or not to engage with it and whether to disengage at any point in the future. This is because the user is able to know its state at all times with near-complete certainty, including how it makes decisions, how rules are enforced, how data is generated, and what updates will be made. The verifiable web provides verifiable guarantees instead of trust-based promises. The verifiable web is underpinned by game-theoretical design�using the science of strategy to produce desired outcomes. The verifiable web combines various technologies to create game-theoretical environments where rational participants are incentivized to produce fair outcomes (i.e., it�s deterministic), even in the presence of adversaries. Furthermore, users can inspect these environments to check if they meet their own standards of trust and fairness. In contrast, the established web relies on trust in probabilistic and unverifiable promises made by the centralized entity that owns the application or runs its backend infrastructure. For example, central banks manage monetary policy based on subjective assessments while banks manage payment ledgers with relative opaqueness. While there are various reasons for doing so, it is a less predictable process that can create systemic risk. Alternatively, Bitcoin uses a game-theoretical design to incentivize a decentralized network of nodes to manage monetary policy and maintain a payment ledger according to a publicly available set of rules enshrined in the software that nodes on the network run. This provides users with verifiable proof about how the ledger is managed and how difficult it is to tamper with the ledger and alter the monetary policy, ultimately creating more predictable risk management. The verifiable web moves society away from probabilistic promises and toward guaranteed contracts. Why Do We Need the Verifiable Web? The verifiable web is what crypto is really about�it starts with fixing money and financial markets, before expanding into other industries to bring greater proof and transparency to the digital interactions that determine our lives. If trust in institutions continues to decrease, demand for technologies that provide verifiable proof about the world will only increase. Some of the areas of growing distrust that the verifiable web can help to improve include: Cryptographic guarantees restore trust in systems. Financial Markets and Services Financial markets have historically been subject to boom and bust cycles as a result of mispriced asset valuations and resulting systemic risk due to their cross-dependencies. People want better guarantees that financial markets and assets are as healthy as the official reports state, and that financial services will be honored as agreed upon. The verifiable web can be an important tool in providing a golden record across market infrastructure or forcing timely and in-full financial payments, ultimately creating more stability and reducing systemic risk. Images and Videos With the acceleration of AI, it�s becoming harder to distinguish between real and fake images and videos. The spread of fake content is leading to the proliferation of false narratives in society, and, as a side effect, increased skepticism in legitimate sources. The verifiable web can play a key role in authenticating the source of images and videos, such as a camera cryptographically signing a photo/video with a unique private key from an HSM hardware module and then hashing a copy onchain as a tamperproof record of who took the photo/video and when it was taken. Information and Analysis The acceleration of AI and information warfare has also made it hard to filter misinformation and disinformation and decide who to turn to for unbiased analysis. The verifiable web can not only help create a single, globally accessible source of truth about the origin of information, but it can also help establish methods for verifying the track record of news sources and analysts over time and incentivize sound research and analysis. The public has lost trust in news and information sources. Food and Goods As society has become more educated, it has also become more interested in the source and quality of food and goods. However, it can be difficult to verify the true origin of a good or that it�s authentic, hasn�t been diluted, and is backed by a manufacturer with a reliable track record. The verifiable web can help users track and rate food and goods from inception to the storefront with more certainty. Contracts and Legal Systems Having verifiable proof that a contract will be honored is critical to running a reliable business or purchasing a product (e.g., warranties). Unfortunately, contracts are not always strictly enforced, especially when one side has a clear economic and political advantage over their counterparty. The verifiable web can level the playing field by replacing clauses in digital contracts with technologically enforced guarantees via smart contracts and oracle networks. This can help improve trust between people, businesses, and institutions globally, particularly by making the levers that can dictate the outcome of contracts impossible for any party to tamper with. Social Participation and Consensus Obtaining a realistic view of what the public thinks helps institutions and society at large make better decisions. AI, bot farms, and closed-source algorithms make it hard to know whether social consensus derived from online debates, surveys, elections, viewership, and more is real or manipulated. Thus, it�s important for the verifiable web to bring authentication and verifiability to how social consensus is created and gathered, such as by open-sourcing algorithms used in information collection and leveraging manipulation-resistant and privacy-preserving verification systems to prove someone is a unique human without revealing their identity. Technologies That Define How the Verifiable Web Works Below is a list of technologies/technological movements that combine to create the verifiable web. New technologies are also likely to emerge as consumers demand more and more verifiable proof and guarantees about their everyday lives. Open-Source Software Open-source software is software for which the code that defines how it runs is verifiable by anyone. This allows stakeholders using or affected by the software to inspect it before deciding to adopt or update it. As more people independently verify it, the software becomes more secure and trusted to consistently operate in a specific way. Examples: Linux Operating System, Mozilla Firefox, and Apache Web Server Cryptography Cryptography involves the use of verifiable mathematical techniques to secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. In a general sense, cryptography is used to conceal and authenticate information by scrambling it with a cipher, which cannot be cracked in any practical sense (e.g., it would require a prohibitive amount of time and investment), even with the most advanced computing technologies. Cryptography is already widely used across the modern Internet to ensure that users are able to interact with each other without worrying about imposters or middlemen intercepting their communications. Examples: One-Way Hash Functions, Public/Private Key Encryption, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs Blockchains and Smart Contracts Blockchains are distributed ledgers that provide verifiable proof that the tracking of asset ownership is accurate and tamperproof, and that the ability to move assets between users is permissionless and always available. Furthermore, the smart contract applications running on blockchains provide verifiable proof that their code will execute exactly as it is stored onchain. This enables businesses to transact and governance processes to be managed in a distributed manner that is transparent and resistant to manipulation by a single entity. Blockchains make use of a multitude of technological primitives, most notably cryptography, consensus protocols, and financial incentives. As an overview, blockchains use financial rewards and penalties to incentivize a decentralized network of independent nodes to come to an honest consensus about the validity of submitted transactions and to keep the ledger updated and available. Blockchains also use cryptography to authenticate transactions, ensuring they are unique to a specific user. The combination of cryptography and decentralized consensus makes it very difficult to tamper with the network, resulting in a form of cryptographic truth. Examples: Bitcoin, Aave, and ENS Cryptographic truth enables deterministic computing�applications that execute exactly as their code dictates�and golden records�a single source of reliable truth outside of the direct control of any one stakeholder. Oracles Oracles leverage similar primitives of cryptography, consensus protocols, and financial incentives, but for the purpose of creating cryptographic truth around any type of data, computation, or connection between systems. Whereas blockchains are only concerned with verifying the ownership and transfer of tokens or updating smart contracts, oracles can be applied to creating truth and guarantees about anything, such as calculating the fair price of an asset, generating a tamperproof and unbiased random number, or ensuring that an automated task will be completed at a specific time or that value will be securely transferred between systems when a specific event occurs. Oracles can expand cryptographic truth to the verification of almost anything. Examples: Chainlink Data Streams, Functions, and Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) Trusted Hardware Trusted hardware is hardware where the software running inside cannot be tampered with or even observed by either a third party or the hardware operator. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) often generate cryptographic attestations, which give users verifiable proof that the software running inside executed exactly as expected. Although the area still requires more research and development, trusted hardware is an extension of other types of hardware like secure enclaves and hardware security modules (HSMs), which provide a protected environment for storing information or executing code. Examples: Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, and Keystone Biometrics Authenticating that information came from a specific person or company is critical proof for facilitating certain processes. Biometrics provide a way of authenticating that an action was taken by a specific person by verifying a physical feature unique to them. For example, phones use a person�s fingerprint as verifiable proof that they belong to the owner. Examples: Fingerprint, Iris Recognition, Facial Recognition Reputation Systems While truths or proofs may not always be obtainable in real-time, they can be demonstrated over time through the use of reputation systems. Reputation systems are methods of tracking the historical performance of an entity or process, such as a system�s uptime, the accuracy of a data provider, the correctness of an analyst�s predictions, or the reliability of a user in a help forum. The integrity of reputation systems is further verifiable when they cryptographically sign data that they�re tracking onchain, where it cannot be deleted or altered in the future. Examples: eBay, Stack Exchange, and Ethereum Beacon Chain Validator Rankings Artificial Intelligence As machine learning algorithms and data collection techniques become more advanced, so too does the ability to analyze complex datasets and come to conclusions with a statistically high degree of confidence. One example of this is a project in development by Green World called AIRS, which aims to use satellite remote sensing data with smart contracts to successfully reward stewards of targeted regenerative agriculture. Chainlink oracles are tasked with gathering ground-truthing and satellite data, analyzing it within trusted execution environments for high-trust quantitative metrics, and relaying it to a blockchain to trigger automated payments to stewards. AIRS rewards to stakeholders can take the form of cryptocurrency�readily convertible into local currency�or digital financial instruments tailored to meet the needs of local communities. A Trust Anchor for Society The verifiable web is a much-needed trust anchor for society, whereby vulnerable human decision-making is replaced by unbiased software that enforces honest outcomes and provides verifiable proof of how it arrived at such outcomes. This new superpower enables builders to create applications that are undeniably fair, provably accessible to anyone in the world, and verifiably secure against manipulation. The possibilities are endless, and this paradigm shift couldn�t come at a more pressing time, with society needing verifiable truth about how the world works more than ever. Chainlink is the decentralized computing platform helping power the verifiable web. From startups to leading financial institutions, builders worldwide use Chainlink to power verifiable applications and high-integrity markets.

    "summary": "Learn how to create a dynamic NFT in under an hour using Chainlink Data Feeds, Automation, and VRF in this step-by-step tutorial.\n\n",
    "content": "Overview Difficulty level: Beginner/Intermediate Estimated time to complete: 60 minutes In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy a smart contract on the Polygon Mumbai testnet using Remix. The smart contract creates a NFT that updates dynamically based on the price of ETH in terms of USD. Below, you�ll find step-by-step instructions on how to: Create a MetaMask wallet Get funds on Polygon Mumbai testnet Create a Chainlink VRF subscription Deploy the Dynamic NFT (dNFT) smart contract using Remix Add the dNFT smart contract as a VRF consumer Automate the NFT using Chainlink Automation View and interact with your NFT on OpenSea Step 1: Create a MetaMask Wallet Note: If you already have a MetaMask wallet (or any other wallet), feel free to skip this step. To create a MetaMask wallet, go to https://metamask.io/ and follow the instructions to create your wallet. Step 2: Get Polygon Mumbai Testnet Funds A) Go to https://faucets.chain.link/mumbai B) Click on �Connect wallet� in the top right corner. C) If this is your first time interacting with Polygon Mumbai, click �Approve� on the MetaMask prompt with the message �Allow this site to add a network?� D) Click on �Switch network�. E) Check the �I am human� checkbox and complete the CAPTCHA. F) Click on �Send request�. G) Wait for the transaction to be completed. Congratulations! You have successfully requested and received testnet Polygon Mumbai MATIC and testnet LINK. Note: If the Chainlink Faucet has run out of testnet MATIC, please use the Polygon Mumbai Faucet to receive testnet MATIC. You will still have to use the Chainlink Faucet to receive testnet LINK. Step 3: Create a VRF Subscription Before we deploy the dNFT smart contract, we will first create a VRF subscription. Think of this as a bucket of funds for your contract to use when generating random numbers. We will need the subscription ID to deploy the smart contract. A) Go to https://vrf.chain.link/mumbai B) Click �Connect wallet� in the top right corner. C) Click on �Create Subscription�. D) Click on �Create subscription� again. E) A MetaMask prompt should appear. Click on �Sign�. F) Click on �Confirm� in MetaMask and wait for the transaction to be confirmed. G) Once the transaction is confirmed and the subscription is created, click on �Add funds�. H) In the �Add funds (LINK)� input box, add 2 LINK and click on �Add funds�. I) Confirm the transaction in MetaMask. Congratulations! You have successfully created your VRF subscription and funded it with some testnet LINK. We will come back to the VRF subscription in the next step. Step 4: Deploy the Dynamic NFT Smart Contract on Remix Remix is an online integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed for developing and testing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a user-friendly interface and a set of powerful tools for writing, compiling, deploying, and debugging Ethereum smart contracts. In this step, you will learn how to create a new Remix workspace and deploy a smart contract. Don�t worry: The smart contract is already written, so all you need to do is copy and paste. A) Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/ B) Click on the �+� icon in the top left corner of your screen to create a new workspace. C) Enter a name for your new workspace and click �OK�. D) Right-click on �contracts� in the left-hand sidebar and click �New file�. E) Name the file �demo.sol� or any other name you would like and hit enter. F) Copy this code. // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\n// This is for DEMO purposes only and should not be used in production!\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.10;\r\n\r\n// Importing other

Note: You might get a pop-up warning that you are pasting a large piece of code. Click �OK�. H) Click on the �Solidity Compiler� icon in the left-hand sidebar. I) Click on �Compile demo.sol�. J) Click on the �Deploy \u0026 run transactions� icon in the left sidebar. K) Click on the �Environment� dropdown and change it from �Remix VM (Shanghai)� to �Injected Provider � MetaMask� and follow the prompts in MetaMask to connect your wallet. L) Before deploying the smart contract to the Polygon Mumbai blockchain, we need the subscription ID from the VRF subscription we created in the previous step. Go back to https://vrf.chain.link/mumbai and take note of the ID of the VRF subscription we just created. Your ID will be different from the one in the example. You first have to let the contract know about the subscription. In a future step, you�ll let the subscription know about the contract. M) In Remix, enter the subscription ID in the input box next to the orange �Deploy� button. N) Click �Deploy� and then confirm the transaction in MetaMask. O) If you see a green checkmark in the console at the bottom of your screen, congratulations! You have successfully deployed the contract to the Polygon Mumbai blockchain! Step 5: Add a Consumer to Your VRF Subscription Congratulations! You�ve successfully deployed your smart contract. Now, it�s time to add the smart contract as a consumer to the VRF subscription you created in step 3. A) In Remix, copy the address of your contract. B) Go to https://vrf.chain.link/mumbai and connect your wallet by clicking �Connect wallet� in the top right corner. If your wallet is already connected, you can skip this step. C) Click on the ID of the subscription you created in step 3. You can find your subscription under �My Subscriptions�. D) Click on �Add consumer� . E) Paste the contract address in the �Consumer address� input box. This will let the subscription know about the contract you deployed. F) Click �Add consumer� and follow the prompts in MetaMask. G) Click �Close� once the transaction is confirmed and refresh the page. You have successfully completed this step if you see a consumer added to your subscription like in the image below. Step 6: Automate Your NFT With Chainlink Automation In this step, you will create a time-based upkeep using Chainlink Automation to dynamically update the background color and the emoji of your NFT. A) Go to https://automation.chain.link/mumbai and connect your wallet by clicking �Connect wallet� in the top right corner. If your wallet is already connected, you can skip this step. B) Click on �Register new Upkeep�. C) Select �Time-based�. D) Paste in your contract address and click �Next� (refer to step 5A if you need help finding your contract address). E) You are going to receive an alert with the following text: �Couldn�t fetch ABI.� In a separate tab, head back to Remix and select the �Solidity compiler� tab in the left sidebar. F) Make sure your contract is selected in the �Contract� dropdown and click on the �Copy ABI� button. G) Go back to your upkeep registration and paste the ABI in the input box and click �Next�. H) Under �Target function,� select �requestRandomWords� and click �Next�. I) Under �Specify your time schedule,� enter the following CRON expression to generate a new background color for your NFT every 2 minutes: */2 * * * * . J) Click �Next�. K) Give your upkeep a name (e.g. Dynamic NFT Demo) and enter a starting balance of 2 LINK. L) Click on �Register Upkeep� and approve the transaction to deploy the CRON job contract in MetaMask. M) Once the transaction is approved, MetaMask will prompt you to confirm a second transaction to �Request time-based upkeep registration�. N) Wait for the transaction to be confirmed and click on �View Upkeep�. O) You have successfully completed this step if you see �Active� under the status of your newly created upkeep. Congratulations! Step 7: View Your NFT on OpenSea A) Go to https://testnets.opensea.io/ and select �Profile� from the drop-down menu in the top right corner. B) Connect your wallet as shown below. You may have to sign a transaction from OpenSea. C) On your profile, click on the NFT labeled �ETH Watching SVG�. D) Click on the three dots in the top right corner and select �Refresh metadata�. E) Wait 30 seconds and then refresh the page and you should see your newly created dNFT! Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial. Every two minutes, until your subscriptions run out of funds, your NFT will check the price of ETH and request a new background color. The next time you refresh the metadata, you should see something a little different. Conclusion If you�ve made it this far, congratulations! You successfully deployed a dynamically updating NFT on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet that uses Chainlink Price Feeds to track the price of Ethereum, Chainlink VRF to choose a random background color, and Chainlink Automation to update the image every two minutes.

    "content": "Testnets are designed to mimic the environment of mainnet to enable developers to test and troubleshoot applications without any value being at risk before mainnet deployment. It�s generally considered good practice to test any contract code on a testnet before deploying it on mainnet�most onchain applications have copies deployed to testnets to enable developers to troubleshoot. In this guide, we�ll show you how to get testnet ETH tokens on the Sepolia network to test your Chainlinked smart contract before deploying it on mainnet. What Is the Sepolia Testnet? Sepolia is the recommended default testnet by Ethereum core developers for smart contract application development. Sepolia was initially launched as a proof-of-authority testnet in October 2021 by Ethereum core developers. The network later transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to mimic the operating environment of Ethereum mainnet. Sepolia uses a permissioned validator set. Since it�s a relatively new test network with a small state, the network is quick to sync to, and running a node on it requires less storage than on mainnet or other testnets. These features are useful for developers who quickly want to interact with the network directly and run a node. Compared to other Ethereum testnets, such as Goerli, Sepolia�s total supply of testnet ETH tokens is uncapped, making it more likely that developers using Sepolia will continue to be able to access testnet tokens in the future. How To Get Sepolia Testnet ETH Using the Chainlink Testnet Faucet, you can request testnet ETH tokens to test your Chainlinked smart contract on Sepolia. Go to https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia. Make sure you have selected the Ethereum Sepolia network since this is where you want to receive the testnet ETH. Click �Connect wallet� so the faucet app can detect the selected network and your wallet address. If you want to receive testnet funds at a different address than the one you connected, paste the address in the �Wallet address� section. This field defaults to your connected wallet address otherwise. Select whether you�d like to receive Sepolia testnet ETH and/or Sepolia testnet LINK. Verify you�re human by clicking on �Login via GitHub� and connecting your valid GitHub account. This step is necessary to protect against spam requests. Click on �Send request�. The tokens are then transferred from the faucet to the wallet address that you specified. If you�d like to learn more about testing your Chainlinked smart contract, visit the Chainlink Dev Hub.

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "In this tutorial, learn how to create your first smart contract using the Solidity language.\n\n",
    "content": "The journey to becoming an expert smart contract developer starts with a single step. In this tutorial, you�ll learn how to build a �Hello World� smart contract with the smart contract development language Solidity. No prior knowledge is required�this tutorial is beginner-friendly. Even if you are not a developer, you can follow the step-by-step instructions to create your first smart contract using the Solidity language. What Are Smart Contracts? Smart contracts are computer programs published and executed in a blockchain environment. As they run on blockchains, they can be run without a central party or server. Once a smart contract has been published, it is not possible to update or make any changes to its code due to the immutable nature of blockchains. However, the smart contract may have been programmed with functions to change data. This information can be recorded in one block and deleted in another, but the history remains and it is possible to audit. Solidity Programing Language Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It is a curly-bracket language, which means that the characters �{� and �}� define statement blocks. Solidity is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript, and is designed to run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is statically typed and supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, among other features. Remix Remix is an online web tool. It is an IDE (integrated development environment) used to write, compile, deploy, and debug Solidity code. Remix has an environment called JavaScriptVM, which is a blockchain simulator that runs in your browser. This tutorial will use it. Go to remix.ethereum.org to get started. Create the Smart Contract Click on the second icon on the left bar, �File Explorers�. Click on the button �Create a new file�. File name: HelloWord.sol Files written in Solidity use the extension �.sol�. Copy and paste this example: // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity 0.8.13;\r\ncontract HelloWorld {\r\n����function sayHelloWorld() public pure returns (string memory) {\r\n��������return \"Hello World\";\r\n ���}\r\n} Now let�s look at what�s in the smart contract. // SPDX-License-Identifier �//� means that this is a comment, not a code line. The SPDX License List Specification is a list of common licenses used in free and open or collaborative software. Solidity 0.6.8 introduces SPDX license identifiers so developers can specify the license the smart contract uses. SPDX license identifiers should be added to the top of contract files, using the identifier �//� // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT Pragma This specifies the version of Solidity, using semantic versioning. Learn more here. pragma solidity 0.8.13; Contract HelloWorld This defines a contract named �HelloWorld�. A contract is a collection of functions and data (its state). Once deployed, a contract will exist at an address on the Ethereum blockchain. Learn more here. Function sayHelloWorld This is a public function that returns the string �Hello World�. It is declared pure because it doesn�t read or modify the blockchain state. Compile a Smart Contract Locate in the left bar a button called �Solidity compiler�. Click on the button �Compile HelloWorld.sol�. It is useful to enable the auto-compile option. Check the green sign at the button with the message compilation successful. Deploy a Smart Contract In the left side panel, go to the button �Deploy and run transactions�. For now, we have only one smart contract, so it is automatically selected in the dropdown �Contracts�. Click on the button �Deploy�. Interact With the Smart Contract When a smart contract is deployed in Remix, we can see it in the left panel under �deploy and run transactions�: Scroll down the left side until you reach �Deployed Contracts�. Expand the �HelloWorld�. Click on the button �sayHelloWorld�. It will return the message recorded in the smart contract: �Hello World�. Congratulations, you�ve created a �Hello World� smart contract! Next Steps Now that you�ve created your �Hello World� smart contract using the Solidity language, there are many possibilities available to you. You could deploy your contract to a testnet or even a mainnet, change the message, create a state variable to store the message, create a function to update the message, or save a message forever to a blockchain!

    "content": "This is Part 1 of a two-part series on the future of trust. Read Part 2, Cryptographic Truth: The Future of Trust-Minimized Computing and Record-Keeping, for a walkthrough of the cryptographic fundamentals that underpin blockchain technology and how Chainlink oracles extend the reach of cryptographic guarantees to the off-chain world. The word �trust� is a heavily debated term in the blockchain industry, where engineers often refer to zero-trust interaction systems, trustless transactions, and other trust-minimized technologies. Though personal interpretations of its meaning in blockchain both vary and overlap, trust will always be at the center of understanding what crypto is really about. Deriving from the Old Norse word traust, meaning �confidence� and also �shelter,� trust has historically referred to the amount of belief one has that people and processes will stay true to their commitments. Trust is foundational to well-functioning societies: high-trust societies generally have increased economic activity and greater social harmony thanks to reduced counterparty risk and fairer dispute resolution. Unfortunately, trust in the institutions responsible for facilitating core social and economic activities is beginning to break down. For instance, Gallup polls indicate that the U.S. population�s confidence in many of the country�s major institutions has been declining over the past 45 years. While the scope of distrust varies across industries and nations, it�s clear from the current negative sentiment toward established systems that people are searching for more equitable solutions. Blockchains, cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and oracles have emerged as new technologies for coordinating social and economic activities in a more secure, transparent, and accessible manner. Most importantly, these technologies are revealing the power of cryptographic guarantees�what we often call cryptographic truth�in restoring users� trust in everyday interactions. Note: We use the word �app� in a broad sense to refer to any interface for interacting with a company, government, or other users on the same platform, whether it be an application you download on your phone or a website. Additionally, when explaining blockchains, we focus on permissionless blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin) given their widespread adoption as opposed to permissioned blockchains. Problem: A Breakdown in Societal Trust The breakdown of trust in traditional institutions and processes is apparent in many aspects of modern societies. Listed below are four problems causing distrust, which directly impact quality of life and economic prosperity. Centralized Ownership of Data and Processes One outcome of the way the Internet was originally architected is that applications (apps) are mostly centralized. A centralized entity typically owns an app�s intellectual property (IP), controls its backend computing, makes key decisions on its future development, and profits from any data and revenue generated. This centralization creates an unequal relationship between users and apps that can easily be abused and fuel distrust. For example, apps can often unilaterally censor the actions of users. Though such actions may be justified as clear violations of terms of service agreements such as the removal of illicit activities, there are many instances where censorship is based on subjective interpretations of vague policies. This puts into question the platform�s credible neutrality�no discrimination for or against any specific people�particularly in situations when the platform�s own financial interests are at stake, external political or social pressure is applied, or users� personal opinions don�t directly align with the platform�s own. Such forces have resulted in polarizing debates as to whether social media, financial services, content streaming, and various other platforms are justified in censoring or not censoring certain content. �A Pew Research Center survey conducted in June (2020) found that roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults think it is very (37%) or somewhat (36%) likely that social media sites intentionally censor political viewpoints that they find objectionable.� Centralization also leads to power structures where small groups of people largely control how platform revenue is distributed and the direction of development while users are left without much say. Though it�s true that owners generally start and manage apps and are to an extent responsible for their success, it�s also true that users often provide immense value to apps as content creators. For instance, users give social media platforms value through the material they generate, which is monetized directly by app developers via advertising. This undoubtedly makes users question whether or not they are getting fair compensation and representation. Users are also becoming more concerned about having to trust apps with their sensitive data. Since users often have to create accounts to interact with apps, the apps are responsible for storing users� personal information. This centralized storage model opens up a single point of attack for hackers that has resulted in numerous data breaches, as was the case with Equifax, for example. It�s also why apps are able to monetize users� data without sharing revenue with users. As many have suggested, �if it�s free, then you�re the product� is the basis for most Web2 economic models. Equifax, one of the largest consumer credit reporting agencies, leaked the sensitive personal data of 148 million Americans, including names, home addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, social security numbers, and driver�s license numbers. No Shared Sense of Truth A further reason for distrust is the fact that participants in a social or economic relationship don�t always operate with reference to the same source of truth. For instance, there are many business relationships where all participants maintain their own set of records. Not only can an honest mistake from a single participant lead to a lengthy reconciliation process, but it�s possible for parties to intentionally falsify their records in an attempt to delay the agreement, escape their obligations, or present a false sense of success to their counterparties. Look no further than the Wirecard scandal, which saw many financial services companies take losses when the German company Wirecard was found to be engaging in fraudulent accounting practices to cover up �1.9 billion in missing funds from its balance sheet. Similarly, the 2007-2008 financial crisis severely impacted the global financial industry, largely because of a poor shared understanding regarding its systemic overexposure to toxic mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and MBS-linked derivatives. Many people in the UK couldn�t access their cash when Wirecard filed for insolvency, as several prominent Fintech apps relied on Wirecard for payment processing. Underpinning this dynamic is the fact that users don�t always understand the legal relationship they have with an institution. Though the misunderstanding could be interpreted as the fault of users for not reading terms of service agreements, it�s fair to ask whether users should be expected to take time to read and understand long contracts with dense legal jargon that�s purposely vague in order to enable a range of interpretations. When things are going well, misunderstandings may never manifest. However, when unexpected events occur, users often learn that their relationship with an institution is not quite what they thought. Unclear legal relationships are why many traders were blindsided when they learned Robinhood could halt purchases of the GME stock during a period of high trade volume, or why Greek citizens were shocked in 2015 when their banks informed them that they were only allowed to withdraw �60 a day from ATMs. Despite its mission of �democratizing finance for all,� many retail investors were left wondering if Robinhood in fact favored Wall Street hedge funds after the platform paused GameStop trading. The same misunderstanding is often true regarding the relationship users think they have with social media apps, particularly with regard to how their data is collected and shared and how the app�s algorithm determines what they see in their news feeds. Algorithms in particular have fueled distrust because of their opaque nature, with users unable to understand why some material takes preference while other material is not shown at all. This lack of clarity naturally leads to users suggesting political bias or undisclosed influences around the news that�s deemed real and credible and the news that isn�t, further causing a breakdown of trust. Lack of Enforcement and Accountability Disputes are inevitable in certain circumstances, so when they arise it�s critical to resolve them in a manner that�s generally seen as fair. The challenge, however, is that larger institutions often have asymmetrical advantages in dispute resolution processes. This is particularly worrisome in contracts between established institutions and retail users, where the institution knows they have more leeway to renege on their stated commitments given that the user doesn�t have the time, capital, or influence to mount a successful lawsuit. In fact, in some developing countries, the legal system is so unreliable in the face of powerful influences and bribery that certain economic relationships are simply not practical. Mistrust in dispute resolution processes is also subject to a dynamic where an institution becomes so powerful and integrated within a society that it becomes �too big to fail��a phrase used to describe institutions that governments will bail out after they make poor decisions because their failure presents too much systemic risk. The term was originally derived from the public bailout of large banking and financial services companies that went bankrupt due to overexposure to toxic MBS assets during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. It could be argued that a similar dynamic can be seen today in a seeming lack of accountability from governments and central banks, as high inflation and increasing economic inequality takes hold despite their stated goals of controlling inflation and promoting economic stability. Verbal and paper-based promises have been routinely misused by governments and institutions throughout history given weak enforcement mechanisms and lack of accountability. Inefficient Multi-Step Processes Through the addition of trusted third parties and manual verification techniques, the risks of low-trust social and economic relationships can be somewhat offset. However, these processes involve increased costs, longer wait times, and additional trust assumptions. One industry subject to such inefficiencies is international remittances, where a $200 dollar transaction in 2020 incurred on average a 6.5% fee and sometimes took more than 24 hours to settle. Technically, remittances could be near-instant given advancements in digital technology, but not all banks trust each other. Thus, payments have to be routed through several correspondent banks to get to their final destination, incurring fees and extending the settlement time along the way. International remittances can be subject to high fees, long wait times, a lack of transparency, and complex relationship management between banks. Solution: Blockchain and Oracle-Based Trust Networks Instead of counterparties having to trust each other or a third party to follow through on their stated commitments, what if the infrastructure facilitating their interaction could guarantee fair outcomes? And what if that infrastructure had no central administrator or owner? In order to meet these goals, this infrastructure would have to embody two key design principles: minimally extractive coordination and trust-minimized execution. Minimally extractive coordination is when infrastructure facilitates interactions between users with minimal, non-value additive rent-seeking. Unlike a for-profit company, the facilitator here has no financial agenda besides connecting users. For example, a financial marketplace that enables users to buy and sell assets with minimal transaction fees. Trust-minimized execution refers to a process that�s facilitated in a manner where the probability of it operating correctly is so statistically high that it can almost be considered guaranteed. In a sense, the user doesn�t have to trust the infrastructure. Instead, the infrastructure is built to be deterministic, meaning all potential variables that could influence the process are removed or decreased to the point where it�s highly unlikely to not execute exactly as written/coded. Some have even referred to this type of infrastructure as trustless, although one can argue that nothing is truly trustless. Blockchains combine these two properties, serving as minimally extractive coordinators that execute code in a trust-minimized manner. Blockchains provide such properties because they do not have central administrators, but are decentralized computer networks that are financially incentivized to maintain an accurate ledger of who owns specific data and assets on the network. Every time someone creates a new asset, transfers an existing asset to another user, or stores data on the blockchain, a decentralized network of nodes must form a consensus around the validity of each interaction before it�s approved. For instance, if a user wants to send money from one account to another, the blockchain will verify that the user has enough money to fund the transaction before executing it. Decentralized consensus and cryptography are combined in blockchains to form the basis for cryptographic truth�validation of new transactions based on the verification of historical information already stored in the blockchain ledger and deemed true. In this sense, blockchains are deterministic, since approving new transactions doesn�t require new or external information. For a deeper understanding of blockchains, refer to these articles: What is Blockchain Technology? and Blockchains and Oracles: Similarities, Differences, and Synergies. Traditional bank payments have banks serve as trusted custodians in between users while blockchain payments have blockchains act as trust-minimized non-custodial intermediaries. While many recognize blockchains for supporting cryptocurrency-based payment systems, blockchains enable much greater utility through their support for smart contracts. Smart contracts are �if x, then y� programs that run on blockchains in a tamper-proof manner. Developers use one or more smart contracts to create decentralized applications (dApps), with the smart contracts essentially representing the terms and conditions that users must abide by when interacting with the dApp. For a deep dive on smart contracts, check out this article: What Is a Smart Contract? Oracles are critical to creating advanced dApps. Because of the way blockchains are secured, they are inherently disconnected from the outside world�akin to a computer without the Internet. Oracles are supporting infrastructure for blockchains that allow them to interact with external data and systems. In doing so, oracles enable smart contracts to use external data to trigger their execution (e.g. sports match results to settle a wager), send data to external systems for settlement (e.g. payment messages to execute a bank payment), interoperate with smart contracts on other blockchains, and perform computations not possible or practical to do on a blockchain. In this regard, oracles enable hybrid smart contracts�combining on-chain code with off-chain code to form a single application. Chainlink pioneered decentralized oracle networks (DONs) in order to bring trust-minimized properties to oracle services and enable competitive marketplaces that mitigate rent-seeking extraction from oracle providers. The result has been an explosion in new smart contract use cases enabled by Chainlink DONs, such as in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Play-to-Earn gaming (P2E), decentralized insurance, and more. To learn more about oracles and Chainlink, refer to these articles: What is a Blockchain Oracle? and What is Chainlink? A Beginners Guide. Chainlink decentralized oracle networks provide smart contracts on any blockchain with the ability to bidirectionally interact with any external system or resource in a secure, reliable, and accurate manner. The combination of blockchains and oracles provides an end-to-end trust network for coordinating economic and social activities. Blockchains act as tamper-proof backends for codifying, tracking, and enforcing digital contracts while oracles enable smart contracts to accurately verify real-world events, seamlessly interact with legacy systems, and securely interoperate across blockchains. This model shifts applications and digital contracts from probabilistic and human-mediated to deterministic and verified through decentralized consensus. Future: Societal Trust Restored by the Power of Cryptographic Truth By applying blockchain and oracle-powered trust networks to the original problems outlined above, it becomes possible to build a world based on truth, where processes and people stick to their agreements and records are highly reliable. Self-Ownership of Data and Decentralized Ownership of Processes One of the biggest benefits of blockchain technology is the decentralization of the apps/institutions responsible for facilitating social or economic activity. Blockchain technology can create credibly neutral platforms where the ability for platforms to arbitrarily censor users because of financial, political, or social pressures is largely removed. Once the terms and conditions are coded into smart contracts and stored on the blockchain, the relationship between the users and dApps is transparent to all and cannot be overridden by either party or a central administrator. Decentralized system design also removes intermediaries as custodians. Instead, the blockchain is akin to a non-custodial facilitator, where all the data produced by dApps is publicly viewable and immutable, and the users have direct control of their data/assets via private keys that only they possess. For instance, anyone can view the entire transaction history of the Bitcoin ledger and anyone can custody and send their Bitcoin to other users on the network without a bank. Additionally, privacy-preserving oracle solutions are emerging, such as Chainlink�s DECO, which is being built to allow users to prove sensitive information to dApps without revealing it publicly. For example, a user could prove they live in a certain jurisdiction or that their bank balance is above a certain amount without revealing their address or exact balance to the dApp�ultimately removing the responsibility from dApps to store credentials while still making use of them. Chainlink DECO uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable the use of confidential data within smart contracts without revealing the data on-chain. Blockchains and the dApps they support are also democratizing access to their cash flows. The Ethereum blockchain, for example, is moving to a proof-of-stake consensus model where anyone in the world can stake (i.e. lock up in a non-custodial manner) its native ETH cryptocurrency in a specific smart contract in order to become a validator on the network. In becoming a validator, the user can earn a portion of the value generated by the Ethereum blockchain as a reward for validating user transactions. Similar dynamics exist in DeFi applications like Curve, a decentralized exchange designed for low-slippage trades. Within Curve, users can choose to lock the native CRV token in a staking smart contract for up to four years, which provides them with governance rights over the dApp and a proportional percentage of 50% of all trading fee revenue generated by the dApp. Shared Truth Blockchains and dApps are generally open-source technologies where all users have a shared understanding of the code powering the dApp and the data generated from its operations. Essentially, the blockchain is a single, public repository of records that are made equally available to all participants, removing reconciliation disputes and making transparent any systemic risk. Transactions are also verified through a decentralized consensus mechanism as opposed to the opinion of a single user or administrator, meaning the relationship between users and dApps will follow the codified terms. When extended to verifying external connections, oracles often use a decentralized network of nodes and numerous data sources to prevent any single point of failure in verification and execution. For example, Chainlink Price Feeds are DONs that supply real-time asset prices on blockchains to support Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a collection of dApps that provide financial services to users such as lending, derivatives, stablecoins, and more. Chainlink Price Feeds, which currently help secure tens of billions of dollars in value across Decentralized Finance (DeFi), are oracle networks that provide real-time asset prices to dApps via decentralization at the data source, individual node, and oracle network levels. Other oracle solutions for generating shared truth include the Ledger of Record proposed by Balaji Srinivasan, former Coinbase CTO and A16Z General Partner. The Ledger of Record is a concept that uses oracles to cryptographically sign data on blockchains to prove its origin, helping establish a verifiable provenance of information. Not only would it help prevent fake news, deep fakes, and hidden news retractions, but it can be the basis for reputation systems that track the historical credibility of data sources and analysts. Consensus-Based and Cryptographically Enforced Commitments Because blockchains validate transactions on their networks through decentralized consensus, the asymmetrical advantages held by larger counterparties during disputes are generally removed. There is no blockchain administrator to bail dApps out or hit redo after a mistake is made. Instead, blockchains replace human administrators with decentralized networks secured by cryptography and financial incentives to make it extremely difficult to tamper with the consensus mechanism or alter previously stored data. While blockchains and dApps can be built in a manner that enables changes, they generally require social consensus amongst many independent users as opposed to the unilateral decision-making seen in centralized Apps. This is why many dApps are governed through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), where users vote on changes. In fact, many dApps have their own native token, which is used by their DAOs to decide on proposals via token-weighted votes. A highly tamper-proof and globally accessible blockchain platform for enforcing digital contracts vastly reduces counterparty risk. Many blockchains and dApps even take it a step further by introducing automatically enforced punishments for bad behavior from participants. For instance, proof-of-stake blockchains can punish validators that act maliciously by confiscating some of their staked tokens as a form of punishment. dApps can also hold users� capital in escrow and distribute it only after verifying certain events, making it near impossible for the losing side to forgo payment. Decentralized oracle networks offer similar assurances by generating definitive truth�where each dApp defines exactly how they want to derive truth from the external world and what falls outside of those bounds. In this sense, oracles are more flexible in verifying external events for smart contracts, as some users may trust different data sources while others may want to pay for more decentralization of the oracle network. No matter how the users design the oracle mechanism, they must all agree that it�s sufficient to service their needs. The agreement between the users and oracles can then be made into a Service Level Agreement (SLA) smart contract to avoid tampering and automatically enforce rewards/penalties upon completion. One example of an oracle service that provides definitive truth is Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF). Chainlink VRF uses oracle technology to generate random numbers and cryptographic proofs off-chain. It then publishes them on-chain, where the blockchain uses the cryptographic proof to verify that the random number was not tampered with by the oracles. NFT and gaming applications use the randomness provided by Chainlink VRF to perform various on-chain functions, such as picking winners of special NFT drops and determining the content of loot boxes. Importantly, users are able to independently verify that the process is fair and unbiased, with even the game developers/NFT creators not able to influence the randomized outcome. Polychain Monsters is a blockchain gaming project that uses Chainlink VRF to mint provably random NFTs from a pool of various traits of varying rarity. Efficient Peer-to-Peer Processes Not only do blockchains provide higher security, reliability, and accuracy guarantees for their computations, but they operate in a peer-to-peer manner. By removing intermediaries, rent-seeking and settlement times can be reduced. This is most evident in Ethereum layer-2 scalability solutions�networks built on top of Ethereum that are optimized for lower costs and higher throughput while still deriving their security from the baselayer Ethereum blockchain. With layer-2 solutions, users can make peer-to-peer payments of any amount to anyone in the world in a matter of minutes and for less than a standard international wire fee. This peer-to-peer quality is also evident in new parametric insurance dApps such as those created by Arbol and Etherisc, which enable anyone to purchase weather and flight insurance, with the only requirement being an Internet connection. The smart contract settles the policy once an oracle network confirms the outcome of the specific insurable event, e.g. crop insurance settled by the amount of seasonal rainfall in a particular region or flight insurance determined by whether or not flights are canceled. Once the oracle report is delivered, the smart contract can instantly release compensation from escrow without needing any human approvals. Parametric crop insurance smart contracts can settle efficiently without human intermediaries. Start Working in the Blockchain Industry If the innovation timeline of the Internet is any indicator, society has only just scratched the surface of what�s possible using blockchain and oracle technology.

    "content": "Decentralized applications, or dApps, are applications that don�t rely on a centralized server or backend but instead make use of Web3 technologies such as blockchains and oracles to contain their logic and backend functions, making them tamper-proof and secure. In this technical tutorial, you�ll learn how to create a simple end-to-end dApp that allows the user to retrieve and store the current price of Ethereum in a smart contract. The completed demo can be found on GitHub. Requirements Please ensure you have the following installed: NodeJS MetaMask What Is a Decentralized Application? A dApp has its backend code running on a blockchain, as opposed to a traditional application where the backend code runs on centralized servers. A dApp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language and deployed on any server or servers to interact with the backend logic. Due to housing their backend logic in highly secure, tamper-proof smart contracts, dApps enjoy many benefits not possible with traditional Web2 systems: Zero downtime Enhanced privacy Censorship resistance Trust-minimized execution of logic However, these benefits also come with some drawbacks. Maintenance of dApps is more involved, as code deployed to the blockchain isn�t modifiable by default. There is also a performance overhead due to running the logic across a distributed network as opposed to a centralized server. In addition to this, user experience can also suffer due to the dApp user needing to go through the complexity of having a Web3 wallet and funding it with enough cryptocurrency to pay for transaction fees. Components of a dApp The components of a dApp can be split into three different categories: smart contracts, the frontend logic and user interface, and data storage. Smart Contracts Smart contracts store the business logic for a dApp along with the state of the application. This is the biggest difference between a dApp and a traditional web application, and what gives a dApp all the benefits mentioned above. Frontend/User Interface While the backend logic of a dApp requires a developer to write smart contract code to be deployed on a blockchain, the frontend or client side of a dApp can use standard web technologies such as HTML and JavaScript. This allows developers to use familiar tools, libraries, and frameworks. The client-side user interface is usually linked to the smart contracts via client-side libraries such as Web3.js or Ethers.js, which are bundled with the frontend resources and sent to the browser together with the UI. Interactions with smart contracts such as signing messages and sending transactions to the smart contracts are usually conducted via a browser-based Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask. Data Storage Most applications need to store data, but due to the distributed nature of blockchains, storing large amounts of data on-chain is not feasible, and can get very expensive. This is why many dApps that need to store data make use of off-chain data storage services such as IPFS or Filecoin, leaving the blockchain to store crucial business logic and state only. You can also use traditional cloud-based storage services. However, many developers choose decentralized options to maintain and extend the trust-minimized properties that a blockchain-powered dApp provides. Ethereum dApp Architecture. Source: The Architecture of a Web3 Application Now that we know the components of a dApp, let�s go through an example of building a simple end-to-end example. Step One: Creating the Smart Contract The smart contract in our dApp will be a simple example used to look up data and reflect state changes on the blockchain. In this case, we will be looking up the value of ETH/USD using the ETH/USD Chainlink Data Feed and then permanently storing the result in the smart contract. The first step is to open up our docs and head to the Using Data Feeds page. From there you can copy the example source code and paste it into a new file in your IDE of choice (e.g. Visual Code), or you can press the �Open In Remix� button and work from the web version of Remix. In this example, we�ll work with Visual Studio Code and Hardhat, an Ethereum Virtual Machine development framework. First, we�ll create a new directory structure for our dApp, with a backend folder for the smart contract code: mkdir chainlink-dapp-example\r\ncd chainlink-dapp-example\r\nmkdir backend\r\ncd backend Next, we�ll open the created directory for our dApp in our VS Code editor and then install Hardhat: npm init -y\r\nnpm install --save-dev hardhat\r\nnpx hardhat\u2028\r\n(choose create javascript project, choose default parameters) Once this is done, remove the Touch.solfile in the �contracts� folder, create a new file in that folder called PriceConsumerV3.sol, and save. This is where we will create our smart contract, so copy the code from the Chainlink docs example into this file and save it. In the sample code, you�ll see the demo contract already has a function getLatestPrice to lookup the current price of Ethereum on the Rinkeby ETH/USD Data Feed.     function getLatestPrice() public view returns (int) {\r\n        (\r\n            /*uint80 roundID*/,\r\n            int price,\r\n            /*uint startedAt*/,\r\n            /*uint timeStamp*/,\r\n            /*uint80 answeredInRound*/\r\n        ) \u003d priceFeed.latestRoundData();\r\n        return price;\r\n We need to create a new variable and a new function to store this value on the smart contract. The first step is to create a new variable under the existing priceFeedone to store the price of Ethereum: ����int public storedPrice; Next, we need to create a new function that can be called by the dApp frontend. The function should look up the latest price of Ethereum by calling the existing getLatestPrice function. Then it should store the value in the new storedPrice parameter:     function storeLatestPrice() external {\r\n        storedPrice \u003d getLatestPrice();\r\n    } Your new contract should look like this: // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.7;\r\n\r\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract PriceConsumerV3 {\r\n\r\n    AggregatorV3Interface internal priceFeed;\r\n    int public storedPrice;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Network: Rinkeby\r\n     * Aggregator: ETH/USD\r\n     * Address: 0x8A753747A1Fa494EC906cE90E9f37563A8AF630e\r\n     */\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        priceFeed \u003d \r\nAggregatorV3Interface(0x8A753747A1Fa494EC906cE90E9f37563A8AF630e);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns the latest price\r\n     */\r\n    function getLatestPrice() public view returns (int) {\r\n        (\r\n            /*uint80 roundID*/,\r\n            int price,\r\n            /*uint startedAt*/,\r\n            /*uint timeStamp*/,\r\n            /*uint80 answeredInRound*/\r\n        ) \u003d priceFeed.latestRoundData();\r\n        return price;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function storeLatestPrice() external {\r\n        storedPrice \u003d getLatestPrice();\r\n    }\r\n} Step Two: Deploying the Smart Contract Now you�re ready to compile and deploy your contract to the Rinkeby test network. Be sure to fund your MetaMask wallet with some Rinkeby ETH first. If you�re using Remix, you can compile and deploy your contract using the standard Remix process. If you�re using an IDE like Visual Studio Code, we recommend using Hardhat to manage your contracts. The first step to compiling and deploying your contract is to install the Hardhat tools library, the Chainlink contracts library, and the dotenv library for storing passwords and sensitive keys in a separate .env file: npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox\r\nnpm install @chainlink/contracts --save\r\nnpm install dotenv Next, replace the contents of your hardhat-config.js file with the following: require(\"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox\");\r\n\r\n//require(\"@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers\")\r\n require(\u0027dotenv\u0027).config()\r\n\r\n const RINKEBY_RPC_URL \u003d process.env.RINKEBY_RPC_URL || \r\n\"https://eth-rinkeby.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key\"\r\n const PRIVATE_KEY \u003d process.env.PRIVATE_KEY || \"abcdef\"\r\n\r\n module.exports \u003d {\r\n     defaultNetwork: \"rinkeby\",\r\n     networks: {\r\n         hardhat: {\r\n             // // If you want to do some forking, uncomment this\r\n             // forking: {\r\n             // url: MAINNET_RPC_URL\r\n             // }\r\n         },\r\n         localhost: {\r\n         },\r\n         rinkeby: {\r\n             url: RINKEBY_RPC_URL,\r\n             accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],\r\n             saveDeployments: true,\r\n         },\r\n     },\r\n\r\n  solidity: \"0.8.9\",\r\n}; The next step is to create a .env file in your backend folder. You then need to extract your Private Key from your Web3 wallet, and paste it into the value section of the PRIVATE_KEY field in the .env file. Please ensure you are using a new Web3 wallet that doesn�t have any funds on mainnet. Once this is done, you need to obtain an RPC endpoint to gain access to the Rinkeby network. You can do this by pasting in the RPC URL in the RINKEBY_RPC_URL field in the .env file. We recommend signing up for a free Infura or Alchemy account to get an RPC URL. Creating the .env file The next step is to modify the contents of the deploy.js file in the �scripts� folder to ensure it will deploy your new contract. Open the file and ensure the following code replaces what is already in there. This will simply take your compiled PriceConsumerV3 contract and attempt to deploy it. Remember to save your changes. // We require the Hardhat Runtime Environment explicitly here. This is optional\r\n// but useful for running the script in a standalone fashion through `node \u003cscript\u003e`.\r\n//\r\n// You can also run a script with `npx hardhat run \u003cscript\u003e`. If you do that, Hardhat\r\n// will compile your contracts, add the Hardhat Runtime Environment\u0027s members to the\r\n// global scope, and execute the script.\r\nconst hre \u003d require(\"hardhat\");\r\n\r\nasync function main() {\r\n\r\n  const PriceConsumer \u003d await hre.ethers.getContractFactory(\"PriceConsumerV3\");\r\n  const priceConsumer \u003d await PriceConsumer.deploy();\r\n\r\n  await priceConsumer.deployed();\r\n\r\n  console.log(\"Contract deployed to:\", priceConsumer.address);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere\r\n// and properly handle errors.\r\nmain().catch((error) \u003d\u003e {\r\n  console.error(error);\r\n  process.exitCode \u003d 1;\r\n}); You�re now ready to compile and deploy your smart contract to the Rinkeby network using Hardhat: npx hardhat compile\r\nnpx hardhat run --network rinkeby scripts/deploy.js You should see a message similar to the one below, showing the address on Rinkeby that your smart contract was deployed to. Note this address down, we will need it for the next step. Deployed smart contract. Congratulations, you�re now ready to move onto the frontend part of your dApp! Step Three: Creating the Frontend Application The frontend logic and user interface of your dApp can be built using a wide variety of different frameworks. React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building feature-rich web user interfaces, and is therefore used by a lot of Web3 dApps. In addition to this, Ethers.js is a JavaScript library for connecting to and interacting with EVM-based blockchains and smart contracts. When you combine the two, you have a sensible starting point for building out the frontend of your dApp. In this section, we�ll create a new React application using the create-react-app boilerplate generator. Then we�ll introduce some off-chain logic that uses Ethers.js to connect the user interface with the deployed smart contract, giving us a full end-to-end dApp. Creating the React Application The first step for creating the frontend is to install and implement the create-react-app boilerplate project, then modify it to suit our dApp. The first step is to install the library into a new �frontend� folder: cd ..\r\nnpx create-react-app frontend\r\n Once this has completed, you should see a new �frontend� folder in your project with all the associated React code. Expand the �frontend� folder and perform the following actions: Delete /src/setupTests.js Delete /src/ReportWebVitals.js Delete /src/logo.svg Delete /src/App.test.js Delete /src/App.css The folder structure should look like the following: React front-end folder structure. We�re now almost ready to start modifying the React application code. But first, be sure to install the libraries for Bootstrap and Ethers.js. Bootstrap is a popular frontend CSS framework that comes with React-friendly UI widgets with CSS styling applied, while Ethers.js allows us to connect our frontend to deployed smart contracts on the blockchain. Ensure these commands are run from within the �frontend� folder. cd frontend\r\nnpm install bootstrap\r\nnpm install ethers\r\n Now we�re ready to modify the React application code. Open up the App.js file in the /src/ folder and remove the contents. We will start building it from scratch. The first step is to tell the application we want to use React (including useEffect and useState libraries) and Ethers.js: import React, { useEffect, useState } from \u0027react\u0027;\r\nimport { ethers } from \"ethers\"; Next, create a function called �App� and export it: function App() {\r\n \r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n Now we�ll start filling out the contents of the �App� function. Add the following code to it. The code does the following: Sets up the storedPrice and setStoresPrice react hooks. Creates a connection to your MetaMask Web3 wallet. Sets the deployed smart contract address and ABI. Both are required by Ethers.js for us to interact with the deployed smart contract. The smart contract address can be obtained from the deployment step earlier in this guide. Plug this value in place of the REPLACE_WITH_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS string. The smart contract ABI can be obtained from the /backend/artifacts/contracts/PriceConsumerV3.json file, in the abi element. You can use a code minifier to format it in a better way for storing in your application.   const [storedPrice, setStoredPrice] \u003d useState(\u0027\u0027);\r\n  const provider \u003d new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)\r\n  const signer \u003d provider.getSigner()\r\n  const contractAddress \u003d \u003cREPLACE_WITH_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS\u003e�\u0027;\r\n  const ABI \u003d \r\n\u0027[{\"inputs\":[],\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"constructor\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"getLatestPrice\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"int256\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"int256\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"storeLatestPrice\",\"outputs\":[],\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"function\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"storedPrice\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"int256\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"int256\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"}]\u0027\r\n  const contract \u003d new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, ABI, signer); Now we�ll create two functions to be used in our application: getStoredPrice will connect to the deployed smart contract and obtain the current value of the storedPrice() getter function. setNewPrice will call the deployed smart contract�s storeLatestPrice function, wait for the transaction to complete, then call the getStoredPrice function to retrieve the stored price in the smart contract. We�ll also add a call to getStoredPrice in our App function so that it will initially call the getter function on page load: const getStoredPrice \u003d async () \u003d\u003e {\r\n    try {\r\n      const contractPrice \u003d await contract.storedPrice();\r\n      setStoredPrice(parseInt(contractPrice) / 100000000);\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n      console.log(\"getStoredPrice Error: \", error);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  async function updateNewPrice() {\r\n    try {\r\n      const transaction \u003d await contract.storeLatestPrice();\r\n      await transaction.wait();\r\n      await getStoredPrice();\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n      console.log(\"updateNewPrice Error: \", error);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  getStoredPrice()\r\n  .catch(console.error) The final step in creating the frontend is for your application to return the JSX code for the browser to render. Paste in the following code at the bottom of your App function, under the getStorePrice() call. This code does the following: Returns a simple two-column grid layout. The first column contains the currently stored ETH/USD price in the smart contract. The second column contains a button that the user can use to interact with the smart contract and update the stored price. Pressing the button calls the setNewPrice function above.   return (\r\n    \u003cdiv className\u003d\"container\"\u003e\r\n      \u003cdiv className\u003d\"row mt-5\"\u003e\r\n\r\n        \u003cdiv className\u003d\"col\"\u003e\r\n          \u003ch3\u003eStored Price\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n          \u003cp\u003eStored ETH/USD Price: {storedPrice}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n        \u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n        \u003cdiv className\u003d\"col\"\u003e\r\n          \u003ch3\u003eUpdate Price\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n          \u003cbutton type\u003d\"submit\" className\u003d\"btn btn-dark\" \r\nonClick\u003d{updateNewPrice}\u003eUpdate\u003c/button\u003e\r\n        \u003c/div\u003e\r\n      \u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n  ); Your application is now ready. If required, you can compare your code to the completed example to ensure you�ve done everything correctly. Now you�re ready to run your dApp. Running Your dApp After ensuring you have all the files saved, start your dApp locally by running the following command from the frontend folder: npm run start After the application loads, a new window should appear in your browser displaying your dApp user interface. You should also receive a popup notification from MetaMask asking to connect your wallet to the application. React frontend. After you verify that you�ve funded your MetaMask account with some Rinkeby ETH, click the �Update� button on the dApp UI to interact with your deployed smart contract on the Rinkeby network. You should receive a notification from MetaMask asking you to confirm the transaction. After you complete this, within a few seconds, your dApp should automatically refresh, and the current price of Ethereum should appear in the �Stored Price� section: React frontend showing Data Feed result. Congratulations, you�ve now successfully created, deployed, and interacted with a simple dApp! In this guide, you�re just running the frontend locally on your computer, but if you want you can deploy it to a cloud-based server, or even decentralize the frontend too and deploy it to IPFS! You can also play around with the application�s CSS to change the look and feel of the user interface. Summary Decentralized applications are applications that replace traditional backend server processing with Web3 technology such as blockchains and smart contracts, giving them unique security and censorship-resistance guarantees that aren�t possible with traditional web applications. In this technical demo, we created a simple dApp that contains a smart contract that obtains the latest price from the ETH/USD Chainlink Data Feed and stores the result in the smart contract. We then created a simple UI that made use of React and Ethers.js to connect to and interact with the deployed smart contract.

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "In this developer tutorial, learn how to call a smart contract from another smart contract in an EVM environment using Solidity.\n\n",
    "content": "Smart contracts are computer programs published and executed in a blockchain environment. As they run on blockchains, they can be run without a central party or server. They are commonly written in the Solidity language. On the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts can interact with existing deployed contracts. This also applies to any other EVM-compatible blockchain (any blockchain that was created using the Ethereum virtual machine). Here are some example of smart contracts that interact with other smart contracts: Token minters or issuers have permission to call a token�s smart contract and issue it. Decentralized exchanges interact with other smart contracts all the time, in the form of traded tokens. When you get a quote for an asset using Chainlink Data Feed, your smart contract is interacting with the asset�s price aggregator, which is another smart contract. When you use Chainlink VRF, the verifiable random number generator, your contract sends a request to the VRF Coordinator, which will send the numbers back to your smart contract. To automate the execution of a smart contract using Chailink Keepers, you create a Keepers Upkeep, which will check conditions and execute instructions on the deployed smart contract. Why Call a Function From Another Smart Contract? Sometimes an application needs to be split into several smart contracts. For example, I once created an application that was already separated into three smart contracts that interacted with each other, but I couldn�t publish it on Ethereum mainnet because the size in bytes exceeded the allowed limit. I had to refactor the application to split it into five smart contracts in order for the app to be published. Another interesting use case is upgradeable contracts. Blockchains are immutable, which means it�s not possible to change the code of a smart contract once it has been deployed. But it is possible to create a proxy delegating function calls to another contract that contains the actual business logic. If you would like to change the logic, you can provide a different target address to the proxy contract, for example a new deployed version with some improvements. It is possible to separate logic and data into different smart contracts. The logic contract could be updated or swapped out via proxy while retaining all information in the data contract. This feature is very powerful as it allows code to be reused and some deployed contracts to be used like libraries. It can also reduce deployment costs because the contract which uses the library doesn�t need to include all the code itself. Calling Another Smart Contract With Solidity Let�s use Remix, an online web tool. Go to remix.ethereum.org to get started. Create a File For Your Smart Contracts Create a file to add smart contracts to. Yes, it is possible to have more than one smart contract in the same file! In Remix, click on the second icon on the left bar, �File Explorers�. Click on the button �Create a new file�. Name your file Contracts.sol You�ll write and deploy two smart contracts in Solidity inside this file. First of all, define the SPDX license type and compiler version. Copy and paste this part: // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\n\r\npragma solidity 0.8.16;\r\n Counter Contract The first contract is the �Counter,� a script to increment a number. Copy and paste this example: contract Counter {\r\n\r\n����uint public number;\r\n\r\n���\r\n\r\n����function increment() external {\r\n\r\n��������number +\u003d 1;\r\n\r\n����}\r\n\r\n} This Counter contract has: A public variable number, of unsigned integer type, which will store the value of increment. A function increment to increase the value of the number variable by one. It is an external function, which means it can be called from other contracts and via transactions. Compile the Counter contract Locate in the left bar a button called �Solidity compiler�. Click on the button �Compile Contracts.sol�. Enable the auto-compile option. Check the green sign at the button with the message compilation successful. Deploy the Counter contract In the left side panel, go to the button �Deploy and run transactions�. For now, we have only one smart contract, so �Counter� is automatically selected in the dropdown �Contracts�. Click on the button �Deploy�. Locate the contract at the bottom of the left panel and copy its address. For example, mine is: 0xd9145CCE52D386f254917e481eB44e9943F39138 You should see something like the image below: Find the contract in the bottom left of screen. Interacting With the Counter Expand the Counter contract and: Click on the �number� button and check that it is 0. Click on the �increment �button to send a transaction to increase the number. Click on the �number� button again and check that now it is 1. This is the final result: The final result of the contract counter. CounterCaller Contract Now that we have our first contract deployed, let�s create another contract which will use the Counter increment function. This is a mechanism like dependency injection. The caller can instantiate the contract it wants to call and knows the type signature of the functions and public variables. Copy and paste this code at the end of the Contracts.sol file: contract CounterCaller {\r\n\r\n����Counter public myCounter;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n����constructor(address counterAddress) {\r\n\r\n��������myCounter \u003d Counter(counterAddress);\r\n\r\n����}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n����function counterIncrement() external {\r\n\r\n��������myCounter.increment();\r\n\r\n����}\r\n\r\n} The CounterCaller contract has: A public variable called myCounter, of type Counter. It means that we are using the contract we want to call as a type, getting the specification for the public functions and variables of the Counter Contract. The constructor, a function that is called only during the deploy process and used to initialize myCounter with the address of the Counter deployed previously. The function counterIncrement which will call the function increment on myCounter, which is like a �pointer� to the smart contract Counter. Check it out the whole file Contracts.sol: // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\n\r\npragma solidity 0.8.16;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontract Counter {\r\n\r\n����uint public number;\r\n\r\n���\r\n\r\n����function increment() external {\r\n\r\n��������number +\u003d 1;\r\n\r\n����}\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontract CounterCaller {\r\n\r\n����Counter public myCounter;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n����constructor(address counterAddress) {\r\n\r\n��������myCounter \u003d Counter(counterAddress);\r\n\r\n����}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n����function counterIncrement() external {\r\n\r\n��������myCounter.increment();\r\n\r\n����}\r\n\r\n} Compile the CounterCaller contract If you already enabled the auto-compile option, it is compiled. Check the green sign at the button with the message compilation successful. Otherwise, follow the instructions to compile the Counter Contract, explained before. Now, let�s deploy the CounterCaller contract. In the left side panel, go to the button �Deploy and run transactions�. In the dropdown Contract, select CounterCaller. Paste the Counter address in the field at the right side of the button Deploy. Click on the button �Deploy�. Deploying the ContractCaller contract. Interacting With the CounterCaller Locate the CounterCaller contract at the bottom of the left panel and expand it. Click on �myCounter� button and check that it is the Counter address. Click on the �counterIncrement� button to send a transaction calling the function increment on the Counter contract. Go to the Counter contract and click on the number button to verify that it increased again, now it should be 2. This is the final result: Interact with the CounterCaller contract. This is a basic example to help you learn how to call a smart contract from another smart contract using Solidity. There are other ways to delegate calls between contracts in Solidity. It is important to notice that a deployed contract always has an address and if you know the functions and public variables, another smart contract can call it. Now that you know how to call a smart contract from another smart contract, a whole host of use cases and abilities are open to you. You can: Split a contract into multiple contracts Design the architecture of complex dApps Enable reusability Create a factory contract (a smart contract which can create others contracts) If you�re a developer and want to secure your smart contracts, dApp, or protocol, consider using Chainlink in your smart contract applications.

    "type": "blog",
    "summary": "One of the main benefits of smart contracts is their transparency. Learn how to read a smart contract on Etherscan in this tutorial.\n\n",
    "content": "What is a smart contract? A basic definition is: A smart contract is a tamper-proof program that runs on a blockchain network when certain predefined conditions are satisfied. What does that mean? Smart contracts, simply put, are programs. The code is transparent and often immutable or unchangeable. Smart contracts are hosted and executed on blockchain networks. Knowing what smart contracts are is great, but how do you read a smart contract to see what it does? How To Read a Smart Contract In this guide, we will look at the contracts for a popular NFT project, Doodles, and how to read these smart contracts on Etherscan. By looking at the project on OpenSea, we can investigate one of the NFTs to find the contract powering the NFT project. There are a few steps to get to the contract and read it. Finding the Project�s Contract Within an NFT project on OpenSea, you can view a single item. Then, under �Details,� you�ll find a link to the contract address. This link will take you to Etherscan, which is a blockchain explorer. Essentially, it allows you to view information about the Ethereum blockchain. Checking For Verified Contracts Once you know the contract�s address, you can view it on Etherscan. The contract address for the Doodles contract is 0x8a90CAb2b38dba80c64b7734e58Ee1dB38B8992e. If the contract�s code isn�t verified, there isn�t much you can do on Etherscan. While the byte code for the contract is available there and it is possible to decompile it, that is outside the scope of this tutorial. If you don�t see the green checkmark next to �Contract,� the code hasn�t been verified. Reading a Verified Contract If the contract is verified, you should be able to look at the code in a more human-readable format. If you click on the �Contract� tab, you will be taken to the code for the contract. Depending on the method of verification the contract�s author used, you may see one big file, which is a concatenation of all the contracts used by the smart contract or, as is the case with Doodles, separate files. Multiple contracts are seen here because a single smart contract often imports other contracts. This allows contracts to reuse verified contracts such as the OpenZeppelin ERC-721 and the Ownable contracts we see in the Doodles project. At this point, you can read through all of the code that powers the Doodles NFT project to ensure that it functions as expected. Interacting With the Contract If you�d like to interact with a contract through Etherscan, that�s also possible if the contract is verified. While mainly outside the scope of this post, the �Read Contract� and �Write Contract� tabs provide access to the functions of the smart contract. Anyone has access to read functions and can execute them for free. Write functions change the blockchain, which requires gas and may come with other requirements such as ownership. Why Reading Smart Contracts Is Important The fact that smart contracts are publicly available to read is one of the advantages of using them. The average user can see the code powering the contract, meaning they can ensure the contract does what it says it does. This reduces the need to trust in the developer. Finding the contract code and reading it is just the start. To better understand what is happening within the contract, you will need a basic understanding of Solidity.

    "content": "Chainlink is the industry-standard Web3 services platform that has enabled trillions of dollars in transaction volume across DeFi, insurance, gaming, NFTs, and other major industries. As the leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink enables developers to build feature-rich Web3 applications with seamless access to real-world data and off-chain computation across any blockchain and provides global enterprises with a universal gateway to all blockchains. With cryptocurrency and blockchain technology gaining mainstream attention and Chainlink establishing itself as a key component of many blockchain applications, more people are entering the industry and asking the fundamental question: what is Chainlink? In order to help those new to blockchains, smart contracts, and oracles, we�ve created a simple overview to showcase the value of the Chainlink oracle network and how it enables blockchain technology to reach its full potential. This guide provides context on Chainlink by answering three key questions: What is the underlying value proposition of blockchains and smart contracts? Why is there an inherent limitation to smart contracts that Chainlink must help resolve? How does Chainlink�s solution unlock the full potential of smart contracts? How Blockchains Eliminate Counterparty Risk To fully comprehend the importance of Chainlink, it�s critical to first understand the underlying value of blockchains and smart contracts. Generally, a blockchain is a decentralized network of computers that performs computation and stores data in a shared ledger. A blockchain differs from traditional, centralized computer systems in that: No single person or group controls it. Everyone in the world has equal access to send it commands. The applications running on it and the data stored in it cannot be tampered with or deleted. All transactions processed over time are recorded in a continuously growing ledger. Transactions are paid for via a native cryptocurrency. Blockchains achieve these properties by having thousands of computers run the same software, process the same transactions, store the same data, and consistently cross-check one another to reach consensus as a network about what is valid. All these network operations are backed by monetary incentives that reinforce honest behavior and consensus. By redundantly validating and storing transactions across a large decentralized network of financially incentivized participants, blockchains make it extremely expensive and impractical to manipulate the shared ledger. Thus, blockchains are extremely secure and reliable systems for performing computation and storing data for processes involving two or more independent parties. The fundamental benefit of blockchains is that they mitigate counterparty risk�the risk that the other party in a contract won�t uphold their end of the agreement. For example, if someone wants to make a digital trade with a stranger, how do they decide who sends money first, whether they have enough funds, and that the funds can�t be spent twice (commonly known as the double spending problem)? Traditionally, users would employ a third party such as a payment processor or clearinghouse to facilitate the trade or arbitrate a dispute. However, a blockchain serves as a more reliable, tamperproof, and unbiased system for settling transactions. Users know that when they send a transaction to the blockchain, it will execute exactly as instructed. As opposed to a bank, a blockchain transfers money between parties without taking custody. A blockchain�s decentralized architecture is why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have emerged as such strong forms of money: users can trust that no central administrator will inflate the supply (capped at 21M BTC) and that the underlying Bitcoin blockchain showing who owns Bitcoin has been validated by thousands of computers across the world. Also, the decentralized design of the blockchain allows users to exchange value directly, �peer-to-peer�, removing custodial middlemen who can siphon off fees and censor transactions, ultimately allowing users to retain ownership over their assets and data. However, blockchains can support many use cases beyond simply moving and recording money on a ledger. Some highly programmable blockchains allow a more expressive set of commands, specifically through running applications on the network that trigger actions based on specific, predefined events (if x event happens, then execute y action). For example, if Flight 777 is canceled tomorrow, issue an insurance payout of $77; if not, then don�t make the payment. These blockchain applications, which can process a wider range of logic, are referred to as �smart contracts,� and have been the subject of much of the development around blockchains since Ethereum first introduced them at scale in 2015. Problem: Smart Contracts Can Reintroduce Counterparty Risk The problem is that a smart contract requires data (e.g. flight departure information) to execute commands, but most of the data it needs to digitize and automate real-world agreements is not stored on blockchains. The smart contract cannot fetch external data either, because blockchains are like black boxes with no built-in ability to connect with the outside world. This means that asset prices, sports scores, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, web data, enterprise systems, and the multitude of other real-world datasets are simply not available on the blockchain, severely limiting the types of smart contracts developers can create. How does one develop a flight insurance agreement without flight data? The only way to efficiently get data into the blockchain is for a software component called an �oracle� to input it into the blockchain. The challenge then becomes, how to design an oracle mechanism with the same security and reliability properties of the underlying blockchain so as to retain the underlying value proposition of the smart contract, e.g. extreme reliability without counterparty risk. If a single, centralized oracle is responsible for inputting the data used to trigger the smart contract, then that oracle has complete control over the smart contract�s outcome. This introduces a serious point of failure known as the oracle problem, which puts the entire smart contract at risk. A centralized oracle introduces a single point of failure in the delivery of data to the blockchain. Solution: The Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Network Chainlink, a decentralized oracle network, was developed to allow smart contracts to automate the transfer of data between blockchains and outside systems in a highly secure and reliable manner. It uses a similar model to a blockchain in that there is a decentralized network of independent entities (oracles) that collectively retrieve data from multiple sources, aggregate it, and deliver a validated, single data point to the smart contract to trigger its execution, removing any centralized point of failure. For example, Chainlink provides the USD price of Ethereum�s native cryptocurrency ETH to blockchains via the ETH/USD Price Feed, which uses numerous independent oracle nodes and data sources to source and deliver the price data (pictured below). The ETH/USD price oracle can then be used by a blockchain application to get the current price of ETH when being used as collateral to obtain a loan or to settle a prediction made about the future ETH price. The ETH/USD Chainlink Price Feed aggregates price data from numerous independent oracle node operators. Chainlink also provides multiple layers of security that go beyond decentralization to ensure users can trust the oracle network: Generalized architecture � Chainlink is a flexible framework for building and running oracle networks, meaning users can construct and/or connect to customized oracle networks without dependencies on other oracle networks. The basic distinction between the Chainlink Network, oracle network, Chainlink node, and node operator. Data signing � Chainlink oracles sign the data they input on-chain with a unique cryptographic signature, allowing users to prove its origin as being from a specific oracle node. High-quality data � Chainlink provides smart contracts with data from any external system including premium data providers and allows smart contracts to send commands to other systems such as to make a payment on a traditional payment rail. Blockchain agnostic � Chainlink can run natively on any blockchain without dependencies on other blockchains, meaning it can support public blockchains, enterprise blockchains, and more. Chainlink connects smart contracts on any blockchain to any input and output. Service-level agreements � Chainlink will eventually allow users to define the terms of the oracle job requested in on-chain smart contracts, which may require that oracle nodes put down a security deposit that is only returned to the node if they perform according to pre-agreed upon terms (e.g. data is delivered on time). Reputation systems � Chainlink oracles� historical performance is publicly available via signed data on-chain, allowing users to select oracles based on historical performance metrics such as average response time, completion ratio, average security deposit, and more. Node operators also have the option of providing additional data like their identity, geographic location, and third-party certifications. Optional features � Chainlink is also developing additional security approaches for features like oracle and data privacy, advanced oracle computations, and more. Use Cases of Chainlink By providing strong security and reliability guarantees on par with the blockchain, more advanced smart contracts are being created using Chainlink oracles. While we have already outlined 77 Smart Contract Use Cases Enabled By Chainlink, some of the main ones include: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Many traditional financial products like loans, payments, derivatives, asset equity, and more are being built on the blockchain using smart contracts to increase their security and transparency and reduce barriers to entry. These DeFi applications use Chainlink to price assets, access interest rates, verify collateralization, and more, which enable these products to perform functions like issue a loan at fair market value, automate the issuance of dividends, and settle an options contract. Insurance Smart contracts are also being leveraged to create parametric insurance contracts on the blockchain. Chainlink is currently being used in production to provide weather data to the Arbol crop insurance market, enabling farmers all over the world to obtain parametric crop insurance simply with an Internet connection, which is settled in a fair and timely manner according to the amount of rainfall, temperature, or other evaluators the policy is set to (e.g. if it rains more than x amount this year, pay out y settlement). Gaming Developers are also beginning to launch smart contract-based gaming applications on the blockchain that often incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFT) as scarce digital collectibles. One of the key building blocks of many blockchain games is a source of randomness to generate random in-game scenarios or determine the lucky winner of prizes. Chainlink provides a randomness solution called VRF, which generates randomness and delivers it to the smart contract in a manner where users can prove it is fair and unbiased, as neither the players, game creators, or external entities can tamper with or manipulate the randomness to their advantage. Chainlink VRF enables input and output randomness for in-game scenarios for blockchain games. Traditional Systems Another key use case of Chainlink is providing traditional systems like data providers, IoT networks, websites, and enterprises a way to make their data and services available to any blockchain network. Since the Chainlink Network is blockchain-agnostic, Chainlink oracles serve as an integration gateway for connecting current digital and data infrastructure to any/all blockchain networks. An industry-standard interoperability framework using oracle networks like Chainlink to connect traditional systems with blockchains was outlined in the recent World Economic Forum report co-authored by Chainlink Co-founder Sergey Nazarov titled Bridging the Governance Gap: Interoperability for Blockchain and Legacy Systems. These are just some of the many capabilities Chainlink provides to allow smart contracts to interact with external data and systems with a high degree of security and reliability. The end result is the ability for blockchain-based smart contract applications to enable extensively more use cases across a more diverse set of markets. If blockchains are decentralized computers and smart contracts are decentralized applications, then Chainlink can be thought of like a decentralized Internet that finally allows smart contracts to interact with the outside world while maintaining blockchain technology�s fundamental guarantees around security, transparency, and trust.

Powering this transformation is the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), a breakthrough in blockchain connectivity and interoperability that enables DeFi applications to access users and interface with other DeFi applications across different blockchains, all from a single interface. CCIP also gives existing financial systems a seamless connection to public and private blockchains�making it easy for them to transition existing assets and financial services on-chain. If successful, we could see trillions of dollars in new assets flow into blockchain ecosystems. Catalyzing the Next DeFi Revolution Over the past few years, the cross-chain ecosystem has experienced growing pains, as previous cross-chain solutions have suffered a number of exploits due to poor design choices, large attack surfaces, and complex user experiences. Over $2.6B has been exploited due to cross-chain bridge hacks thus far. What the market needs is a cross-chain solution with a higher standard of security, reliability, and usability. 64% of funds stolen in DeFi hacks in 2022 were from cross-chain bridge hacks, according to Chainalysis. 1/ The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has officially launched on Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon mainnets.#LinkTheWorld pic.twitter.com/SdLVyaapg3 � Chainlink (@chainlink) July 17, 2023 Pioneered by a world-class research team, CCIP raises the bar in cross-chain security by introducing new features, such as rate limits on token transfers as a way to minimize potential damage and the Risk Management Network�an independent network that verifies cross-chain operations for erroneous activity. CCIP also establishes new standards in cross-chain reliability and usability by introducing features such as Smart Execution�a gas-locked fee payment mechanism where users only need to pay on the source chain and CCIP will take care of execution on the destination chain. Underpinning these new features is the same Chainlink foundation of decentralized oracle networks that have already helped secure tens of billions of dollars for DeFi protocols and enabled over $8 trillion in on-chain transaction value. CCIP is now running live on Mainnet for Early Access participants, which include two leading DeFi protocols: Synthetix�CCIP enables synth tokens to flow seamlessly across chains to wherever there is the greatest immediate demand, deepening liquidity and increasing capital efficiency. Aave�CCIP is being integrated to power Aave�s multi-chain governance system, saving significant time and developer resources and increasing protocol security. �Security is critical when dealing with on-chain assets, which is why we leverage Chainlink CCIP for our cross-chain Synths Teleporter.��Kain Warwick, Founder, Synthetix The On-Chain Gateway for the World�s Biggest Banks Illiquid assets can grow from 16x to 17x from today�s levels (BCG, 2022). Hundreds of trillions of dollars flow across global financial markets. Universal and frictionless connectivity across financial markets is a massive value-add for all participants, which is why widely adopted financial market infrastructure providers such as DTCC, Euroclear, and Swift exist. While 97% of institutional investors agree that �tokenization will revolutionize asset management,� there have been two long-standing roadblocks to moving hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of assets on-chain: Blockchain connectivity (legacy-to-blockchain): The ability to connect the core business infrastructure of existing financial systems to any blockchain. Cross-chain interoperability (blockchain-to-blockchain): A highly secure communication standard that can connect any public or private chain to one another. CCIP overcomes these challenges. In a recently announced collaboration with Swift, Chainlink CCIP is helping enable end-to-end communication between legacy systems and blockchain networks, as well as interoperability across both public and private blockchains. Over a dozen major global financial institutions and financial market infrastructure providers are participating in the collaboration, including DTCC, BNY Mellon, Citi, and Euroclear. �[This collaboration] will also highlight the potential value of using a blockchain interoperability protocol to securely transfer data and value between legacy systems and a potentially unlimited number of blockchains.��Jonathan Ehrenfeld, Head of Securities Strategy at Swift Creating the Unified Internet of Contracts Chainlink CCIP connects private and public blockchain networks to create a unified Internet of contracts. Today, the world�s contractual value is fragmented across both the existing financial system and the multi-chain Web3 ecosystem. The fragmentation of blockchain networks is similar to the early days of the Internet, where there were separate intranets, LANs, and consortiums of terminals that couldn�t interact with one another. The early interoperability standards completely transformed the Internet. TCP/IP, HTTP, and email protocols enabled seamless connectivity between users, who then saw their web applications increase in value exponentially as more people joined the network. It shouldn�t matter what blockchain you launch a dApp or token on or what type of backend system you want to interact from�as long as that environment is connected to an interoperability standard, it can access any chain and its supported dApps. Now, CCIP provides a connectivity standard that enables traditional finance to easily interact with smart contracts, as well as securely transact across different public and private blockchains. Connectivity both to and across multiple blockchains is critical for creating a unified financial system where tokens and messages can seamlessly flow across different environments. Similar to TCP/IP�s foundational role in Internet communication, Chainlink CCIP is the foundation for an interoperable blockchain ecosystem. The key difference between TCP/IP and CCIP is that while TCP/IP enables information to flow freely across the Internet, CCIP enables value to be transferred across networks securely. The launch of CCIP marks a key moment in the evolution of the Internet and moves society one step closer to a world underpinned by interoperable smart contracts: The Internet of Contracts. �Just like key standards such as TCP/IP remade a fragmented early internet into the single global internet we all know and use today, we are making CCIP to connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank chain ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts.��Chainlink Co-Founder, Sergey Nazarov Bringing It All Together: The On-Chain Economy Powered by Chainlink Potential value to be secured by Chainlink CCIP. Becoming the industry standard across both bank chains and public blockchains positions CCIP to become the universal connectivity layer bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. We envision a future where Web3 and the global financial system are largely one and the same, with vast amounts of value flowing across these systems and chains via CCIP. By connecting these two worlds, the extensive liquidity and technological infrastructure already present in the global financial system can take advantage of the transparency, efficiency, and connectivity advantages now available through blockchains. Given the massive size of the global banking system, if even a small fraction of assets move on-chain and connect to the Internet of Contracts, the Web3 ecosystem could grow exponentially.

    "summary": "Discover how to use Chainlink CCIP to create cross-chain applications, enabling a less fragmented Web3.\n\n",
    "content": "Chainlink�s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is a new generalized cross-chain communication protocol that provides smart contract developers with the ability to transfer data and tokens across blockchain networks in a trust-minimized manner. Currently, applications deployed across multiple blockchains suffer from the fragmentation of assets, liquidity, and users. With CCIP, developers can utilize token transfers and arbitrary messaging to enable the creation of decentralized applications that are composed of multiple different smart contracts deployed across multiple different blockchain networks that interoperate to create a single unified application. This Web3 design pattern is known as the cross-chain smart contract. Below are a few examples of CCIP use cases for cross-chain applications, ranging from DeFi and cross-chain ENS to minting NFTs on multiple chains to cross-chain gaming. These use case examples demonstrate the potential for CCIP to transform traditional single-chain or multi-chain applications into powerful new cross-chain dApps. All examples can be found on the Chainlink Labs GitHub and can be deployed and interacted with now. DeFi: Cross-Chain Composability DeFi is a category of Web3 applications that is ripe for transformation by cross-chain smart contracts. In the world of DeFi today, many applications are either deployed on a single chain or on multiple chains, with each instance requiring its own set of users and liquidity. Within each chain, there is a concept of DeFi composability and �money Legos,� with developers able to permissionless-ly connect and integrate with various protocols deployed on a particular network to create new use cases and financial products. By enabling cross-chain smart contracts and cross-chain token transfers, CCIP takes the concept of DeFi composability and exponentially multiplies it. Because now, instead of composability being restricted to each chain and limited to the DeFi protocols on that chain, all DeFi applications on all blockchains can now be composed together in various ways to create new financial products. Applications and protocols are no longer confined to the chain they�re on. This cross-chain composability of DeFi applications enables a less fragmented and more connected DeFi ecosystem, with liquidity, users, and financial products on all chains being available to all protocols. Using the money Legos analogy, CCIP enables you to bring all of your different Lego sets together and build financial protocols with them as if they were a single, unified set. One particular DeFi financial service that would greatly benefit from CCIP is lending and borrowing. In today�s world, most DeFi lending and borrowing protocols require you to deposit collateral on the chain the protocol you want to use is deployed on. But many DeFi users use multiple DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains and have assets scattered across all these chains. These users often chase the best returns, adjusting their positions to maximize yield, but in many cases they have assets locked up in protocols on one chain when there are better yield-earning opportunities to use those assets on another chain. If they wanted to participate in those superior yield opportunities, they�d need to liquidate their position on one chain, manually bridge the asset to the new chain, deposit that asset on to the protocol on the new chain, and then perform the same process in reverse when they want to return their asset to the originating chain�a lot of steps just to move assets into a new protocol to chase yield opportunities. Scenarios like this are where CCIP can help enable DeFi protocols to truly go cross-chain, and allow users to seamlessly utilize digital assets on one chain as collateral for a DeFi protocol on another chain, all handled by CCIP at the protocol level, without the user having to perform manual steps, or adding trust assumptions due to using a third party bridge. Using CCIP, a DeFi protocol can enable a borrower to deposit assets on one (source) chain, or transfer them directly to a destination chain, and then have those assets made available on the destination chain to borrow against. Then when they wish to stop using their assets on the destination chain, the DeFi protocol can use CCIP to withdraw their position and move their assets back to the originating chain. This is the power of CCIP-enabled DeFi. In this example, we have a DeFi smart contract Sender.sol on the Avalanche Fuji testnet. This contract accepts user deposits in the form of a token; it could be wrapped ETH, a stablecoin, or any token that has a real value. Sender.sol has a sendMessage function, which uses CCIP to execute a programmable token transfer of the specified tokens as well as a message to a destination chain. In this case, we are sending the specified tokens to the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, with the message containing the end-user�s EOA (externally owned account): // Sender.sol\r\n Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory evm2AnyMessage \u003d Client.EVM2AnyMessage({\r\nreceiver: abi.encode(receiver), // ABI-encoded receiver contract address\r\ndata: data,\r\ntokenAmounts: tokenAmounts,\r\nextraArgs: Client._argsToBytes(\r\nClient.EVMExtraArgsV1({gasLimit: 200_000, strict: false}) // Additional arguments, setting gas limit and non-strict sequency mode\r\n),\r\nfeeToken: address(linkToken) // Setting feeToken to LinkToken address, indicating LINK will be used for fees\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\n// Initialize a router client instance to interact with cross-chain router\r\nIRouterClient router \u003d IRouterClient(this.getRouter());\r\n\r\n\r\n// Get the fee required to send the message. Fee paid in LINK.\r\nuint256 fees \u003d router.getFee(destinationChainSelector, evm2AnyMessage);\r\n\r\n\r\n// Approve the Router to pay fees in LINK tokens on contract\u0027s behalf.\r\nlinkToken.approve(address(router), fees);\r\n\r\n\r\n// Approve the Router to transfer the tokens on contract\u0027s behalf.\r\nIERC20(tokenToTransfer).approve(address(router), transferAmount);\r\n\r\n\r\n// Send the message through the router and store the returned message ID\r\nmessageId \u003d router.ccipSend(destinationChainSelector, evm2AnyMessage);\r\n\r\n\r\n// Emit an event with message details\r\nemit MessageSent(messageId, destinationChainSelector, receiver, msg.sender, tokenAmount, fees);\r\n Note: All code examples in this post are illustrative and are provided on an �as-is� basis without any representations, warranties, covenants, or conditions of any kind. Use of these code snippets is governed by our Terms of Service found at chain.link/terms. On the Ethereum Sepolia network, we have deployed a Protocol.sol smart contract. This contract receives the CCIP programmable token transfer message and does the following: Mints and controls stablecoins that can be borrowed against deposited collateral. From the CCIP message, reads the specified token contract address (on the destination chain) for which funds were sent from the source chain (as collateral for borrowing) and the amount deposited. Also from the CCIP message contents, reads the end-user�s (depositor/borrower�s) wallet address. The stablecoin is minted to this address, and this address is also used to track deposits and borrowing. Stores this information in the smart contract. // Protocol.sol\r\n   bytes32 messageId \u003d any2EvmMessage.messageId; // fetch the messageId\r\n   uint64 sourceChainSelector \u003d any2EvmMessage.sourceChainSelector; // fetch the source chain identifier (aka selector)\r\n   address sender \u003d abi.decode(any2EvmMessage.sender, (address)); // abi-decoding of the sender address\r\n\r\n   // Collect tokens transferred. This increases this contract\u0027s balance for that Token.\r\n   Client.EVMTokenAmount[] memory tokenAmounts \u003d any2EvmMessage.destTokenAmounts;\r\n   address token \u003d tokenAmounts[0].token;\r\n   uint256 amount \u003d tokenAmounts[0].amount;\r\n\r\n   address depositor \u003d abi.decode(any2EvmMessage.data, (address)); // abi-decoding of the depositor\u0027s address\r\n\r\n   receivedMessages.push(messageId);\r\n   MessageIn memory detail \u003d MessageIn(sourceChainSelector, sender, depositor, token, amount);\r\n   messageDetail[messageId] \u003d detail;\r\n\r\n   emit MessageReceived(messageId, sourceChainSelector, sender, depositor, tokenAmounts[0]);\r\n\r\n   // Store depositor data.\r\n   deposits[depositor][token] \u003d amount;\r\n Once this CCIP programmable token transfer message has been received and successfully processed by Protocol.sol, the user can then manually initiate an action to borrow funds by executing the borrowUSDC function. This function allows the user to use the transferred tokens as collateral to mint and borrow an equivalent amount of a stablecoin, such as USDC, to the borrower�s EOA. In this example, we assume a 70% collateralization ratio, meaning that the protocol will lend no more than 70% of the value of the deposited token: uint256 borrowed \u003d borrowings[msg.sender][address(usdcToken)];\r\nrequire(borrowed \u003d\u003d 0, \"Caller has already borrowed USDC\");\r\n\r\naddress transferredToken \u003d messageDetail[msgId].token;\r\nrequire(transferredToken !\u003d address(0), \"Caller has not transferred this token\");\r\n\r\nuint256 deposited \u003d deposits[msg.sender][transferredToken];\r\nuint256 borrowable \u003d (deposited * 70) / 100; // 70% collateralization ratio.\r\n\r\n// LINK/USD on Sepolia (https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xc59E3633BAAC79493d908e63626716e204A45EdF)\r\n// Docs: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses#Sepolia%20Testnet\r\nAggregatorV3Interface priceFeed \u003d AggregatorV3Interface(0xc59E3633BAAC79493d908e63626716e204A45EdF);\r\n\r\n(, int256 price, , , ) \u003d priceFeed.latestRoundData(); \r\nuint256 price18decimals \u003d uint256(price * (10 ** 10)); // make USD price 18 decimal places from 8\r\n\r\n\r\nuint256 borrowableInUSDC \u003d borrowable * price18decimals;\r\n\r\n// MintUSDC\r\nusdcToken.mint(msg.sender, borrowableInUSDC);\r\n\r\n// Update state.\r\nborrowings[msg.sender][address(usdcToken)] \u003d borrowableInUSDC;\r\n\r\n\r\nreturn borrowableInUSDC;\r\n Once the user has successfully borrowed UDSC on Sepolia against their deposited collateral, they can then use the funds as they wish on any DeFi protocol on the Sepolia network. Then, when they are done, they can repay the funds to Protocol.sol, which will cause the stablecoin tokens to be burnt, and a CCIP programmable token transfer message is then sent back to the Sender.sol contract on the Fuji network, which will return the locked up tokens to the specified address on the Fuji network. Note that the user must first approve Protocol.sol as a �spender� of the user�s borrowed stablecoin for the protocol to be able to burn the borrowed amount, which is how repayment is implemented: require(amount \u003e\u003d borrowings[msg.sender][address(usdcToken)], \"Repayment amount is less than amount borrowed\");\r\n\r\n\r\n// Get the deposit details, so it can be transferred back.\r\naddress transferredToken \u003d messageDetail[msgId].token;\r\nuint256 deposited \u003d deposits[msg.sender][transferredToken];\r\n\r\n\r\nuint256 mockUSDCBal \u003d usdcToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);\r\nrequire(mockUSDCBal \u003e\u003d amount, \"Caller\u0027s USDC token balance insufficient for repayment\");\r\n\r\n\r\nif (usdcToken.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) \u003c borrowings[msg.sender][address(usdcToken)]) {\r\nrevert(\"Protocol allowance is less than amount borrowed\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nusdcToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, mockUSDCBal);\r\n\r\n\r\nborrowings[msg.sender][address(usdcToken)] \u003d 0;\r\n// send transferred token and message back to Sepolia Sender contract\r\nsendMessage(destinationChain, receiver, transferredToken, deposited); The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the CCIP-DeFi Lending GitHub repository. DeFi: Cross-Chain Liquidation Protection Continuing with the theme of DeFi and lending and borrowing protocols, many DeFi users have multiple positions held across multiple DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains. This makes keeping track of portfolios and DeFi positions difficult. There are multiple third-party platforms, trackers, and even yield aggregators available, with DeFi users able to simply deploy collateral and let these third-party platforms handle the deploying and moving around of assets to optimize yield for the end-user. While these tools are a great way to abstract away some of the complexities of DeFi so users can simply earn yield, they are not trust-minimized. The user is entrusting the protocol to earn yield and to ensure positions are kept collateralized to avoid liquidation. In addition to this, if the end-user wants to have some sort of liquidation protection, they are required to have native assets deployed across all blockchains they have DeFi positions in, ready to be deployed to ensure collateralization of loans on the positions they have on each respective chain. With CCIP and cross-chain token transfers and messaging, DeFi protocols, position monitoring apps, and yield aggregators can be enhanced to have cross-chain liquidation protection. This means that a user can have open positions on multiple DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains, and they can then allocate assets on a single chain to be used as extra collateral in the event that one or more of the loans requires extra funds to ensure collateralization. Here�s how that works at a high level: A DeFi end-user has debt positions across multiple protocols across multiple chains (e.g., Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon), but they keep their liquidity safely in a vault on one chain (e.g., Aave on Ethereum). On each chain where the user has a debt position, a user�s implementation of Chainlink Automation monitors the debt ratio of the positions. If Automation detects that any of their loans are approaching the liquidation threshold, then Automation will send a CCIP message to the user�s liquidity chain (e.g., Ethereum) to request funds to be sent to top up the debt position. When the contract on the liquidity chain receives the CCIP message, it withdraws liquidity from Aave and sends a new CCIP message back to the requesting chain with the funds. The message includes enough information and tokens to fund the position and avoid a liquidation scenario. The result of this is the user can have debt positions on multiple chains while still keeping liquidity on a single chain. The entire process is trust-minimized, with the user still 100% in control of their debt positions, and they do not have to manually withdraw and move funds across chains. Here�s how it works: Chainlink Automation monitors all chains where a user has a debit position and determines if a message for funding needs to be sent. If required, the performUpkeep function will then send a CCIP message to the vault on the chain that has liquidity, requesting funds to be sent. function checkUpkeep(\r\n       bytes calldata checkData\r\n   )\r\n       external\r\n       view\r\n       override\r\n       returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData)\r\n   {\r\n       upkeepNeeded \u003d\r\n           IMockLending(i_lendingAddress).healthFactor(i_onBehalfOf) \u003c\r\n           i_minHealthFactor \u0026\u0026\r\n           !_isCcipMessageSent;\r\n   }\r\n\r\nfunction performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override {\r\n       require(\r\n           !_isCcipMessageSent,\r\n           \"CCIP Message already sent, waiting for a response\"\r\n       );\r\n       require(\r\n           IMockLending(i_lendingAddress).healthFactor(i_onBehalfOf) \u003c\r\n               i_minHealthFactor,\r\n           \"Account can\u0027t be liquidated!\"\r\n       );\r\n\r\n       // Ask for funds from LPSC on the source blockchain\r\n       Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message \u003d Client.EVM2AnyMessage({\r\n           receiver: abi.encode(i_lpsc),\r\n           data: abi.encode(\r\n               i_tokenAddress,\r\n               IMockLending(i_lendingAddress).getBorrowedAmount(i_onBehalfOf)\r\n           ),\r\n           tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0),\r\n           extraArgs: \"\",\r\n           feeToken: i_link\r\n       });\r\n\r\n       bytes32 messageId \u003d IRouterClient(i_sourceChainRouter).ccipSend(\r\n           i_sourceChainSelector,\r\n           message\r\n       );\r\n       _isCcipMessageSent \u003d true;\r\n\r\n       emit MessageSent(messageId);\r\n   }\r\n The vault on the chain that has the liquidity then receives the request for funds and checks if it has enough funds to send back to the requesting chain or if it should withdraw some liquidity from a DeFi protocol (such as Aave) to ensure it has enough funds to send. Following this, it then initiates a CCIP programmable token transfer containing the funds requested as well as the message ID of the initially received message (so the destination contract on the blockchain that requested funds knows which request the funds are for): function _ccipReceive(\r\n       Client.Any2EVMMessage memory receivedMessage\r\n   ) internal override {\r\n       bytes32 messageId \u003d receivedMessage.messageId;\r\n       uint64 sourceChainSelector \u003d receivedMessage.sourceChainSelector;\r\n       address sender \u003d abi.decode(receivedMessage.sender, (address));\r\n       (address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) \u003d abi.decode(\r\n           receivedMessage.data,\r\n           (address, uint256)\r\n       );\r\n\r\n       address tokenToReturn \u003d s_destinationToSourceMap[\r\n           keccak256(abi.encodePacked(tokenAddress, sourceChainSelector))\r\n       ];\r\n\r\n       uint256 currentBalance \u003d IERC20(tokenToReturn).balanceOf(address(this));\r\n\r\n       // If there are not enough funds in LPSC, withdraw additional from Aave vault\r\n       if (currentBalance \u003c amount) {\r\n           withdrawFromVault(tokenToReturn, amount - currentBalance);\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       Client.EVMTokenAmount[] memory tokenAmounts;\r\n       tokenAmounts[1] \u003d (Client.EVMTokenAmount(tokenToReturn, amount));\r\n\r\n       Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory messageReply \u003d Client.EVM2AnyMessage({\r\n           receiver: abi.encode(sender),\r\n           data: abi.encode(msgId),\r\n           tokenAmounts: tokenAmounts,\r\n           extraArgs: \"\",\r\n           feeToken: LINK\r\n       });\r\n\r\n       bytes32 replyMessageId \u003d IRouterClient(i_router).ccipSend(\r\n           sourceChainSelector,\r\n           messageReply\r\n       );\r\n\r\n       //  emit ReplySent(replyMessageId,sourceChainSelector, messageId, sender, tokenToReturn, amount);\r\n   }\r\n Finally, the smart contract on the chain that requested funds to top up a debt position receives the CCIP programmable token transfer, matches up the request ID with it�s original request, and then takes the funds and deposits the transferred funds into the debt position in order to increase the collateralization of the loan and avoid a liquidation: function _ccipReceive(\r\n        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory receivedMessage\r\n    ) internal override {\r\n        _isCcipMessageSent \u003d false;\r\n        bytes32 requestMessageId \u003d abi.decode(receivedMessage.data, (bytes32));\r\n        uint256 amountToRepay \u003d requested[requestMessageId];\r\n        IMockLending(i_lendingAddress).repay(\r\n            i_tokenAddress,\r\n            amountToRepay,\r\n            i_onBehalfOf\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n This example demonstrates how CCIP can be utilized in DeFi protocols and DeFi position monitoring applications to provide users with trust-minimized liquidation protection of their debt positions across multiple blockchains while allowing them to keep their funds and liquidity on a single blockchain. The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the CCIP Liquidation Protector GitHub repository. Cross-Chain Domain Name Service Decentralized domain name services like ENS are extremely popular in Web3, as they facilitate the translation of human readable names to wallet addresses. In an ideal world, domain name services should not be specific to one chain, but each registered domain should propagate and live across all Ethereum chains, side chains, layer 2s, and app chains. This would allow users to have a single, unified identity across the entire Ethereum ecosystem, as opposed to having to register domains across multiple naming services or using interoperability solutions that aren�t trust-minimized. However, to achieve this, domain name services would be required to communicate with other blockchains. Each instance of the naming service on a blockchain would need to be notified when new domains are registered, and there would need to be a way to perform �lookups� against a global name registry across all blockchains. This example showcases how you could build a simplified cross-chain naming service application, where users could register domains on one chain and have that registration propagate across multiple other blockchains as well as resolve names to addresses across any blockchain. Overview of cross-chain naming architecture The first step is to deploy the CrossChainNameServiceRegister and CrossChainNameServiceLookup contracts to the Ethereum Sepolia network. This network will act as the �home� network where all registrations will occur, and then propagate to other chains. When you register a new .ccns handle, the CrossChainNameServiceRegister contract will use CCIP to send a message to other supported blockchains containing information about the registered .ccns handle: uint256 length \u003d s_chains.length;\r\n       for (uint256 i; i \u003c length; ) {\r\n           Chain memory currentChain \u003d s_chains[i];\r\n\r\n           Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message \u003d Client.EVM2AnyMessage({\r\n               receiver: abi.encode(currentChain.ccnsReceiverAddress),\r\n               data: abi.encode(_name, msg.sender),\r\n               tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0),\r\n               extraArgs: Client._argsToBytes(\r\n                   Client.EVMExtraArgsV1({\r\n                       gasLimit: currentChain.gasLimit,\r\n                       strict: currentChain.strict\r\n                   })\r\n               ),\r\n               feeToken: address(0) // We leave the feeToken empty indicating we\u0027ll pay raw native.\r\n           });\r\n\r\n           i_router.ccipSend{\r\n               value: i_router.getFee(currentChain.chainSelector, message)\r\n           }(currentChain.chainSelector, message);\r\n\r\n           unchecked {\r\n               ++i;\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       i_lookup.register(_name, msg.sender);\r\n On all the supported receiving blockchains, the CrossChainNameServiceReceiver contract would be deployed. This contract would receive registered .ccns domains from the CrossChainNameServiceRegister contract, and would store them in the CrossChainNameServiceLookup contract deployed on that blockchain: constructor(\r\n        address router,\r\n        address lookup,\r\n        uint64 sourceChainSelector\r\n    ) CCIPReceiver(router) {\r\n        i_router \u003d IRouterClient(router);\r\n        i_lookup \u003d ICrossChainNameServiceLookup(lookup);\r\n        i_sourceChainSelector \u003d sourceChainSelector;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function _ccipReceive(\r\n        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message\r\n    ) internal override onlyFromSourceChain(message.sourceChainSelector) {\r\n        (string memory _name, address _address) \u003d abi.decode(\r\n            message.data,\r\n            (string, address)\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        i_lookup.register(_name, _address);\r\n    }\r\n Finally, the CrossChainNameServiceLookup contract would be deployed on all blockchains, including the registering blockchain (in this case, Sepolia), as well as all destination blockchains. This contract would be used to store all registered .ccns handles and act as an interface to perform lookups to translate names to addresses: function register(\r\n        string memory _name,\r\n        address _address\r\n    ) external onlyCrossChainNameService {\r\n        if (lookup[_name] !\u003d address(0)) revert AlreadyTaken();\r\n\r\n        lookup[_name] \u003d _address;\r\n    }\r\n Using this simple design pattern, it becomes possible to create a simple cross-chain domain name service where users can register a domain once, then own and use it across multiple blockchains. The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the Cross-Chain Name Service GitHub repository. Cross-Chain NFTs NFTs are one of the most popular use cases in Web3. Each NFT project is usually on a single blockchain, or the project itself has multiple deployments across multiple chains, with end-users having to mint the NFT more than once if they want to own it on multiple blockchains. With CCIP Arbitrary Messaging, NFT projects can allow for their assets to be minted once on a single chain, paid for once by the minter, and then have them propagated to the user on other blockchains. This means users can own and share their NFT, irrespective of which network they are using. CCIP can also be used to �burn and mint� NFTs across chains, allowing users to move their NFTs from one chain to another. Here is an example of how the first scenario works: The MyNFT contract contains a simple NFT smart contract with a mint function: function mint(address to) public {\r\n    unchecked {\r\n        tokenId++;\r\n    }\r\n    _safeMint(to, tokenId);\r\n}\r\n The sourceMinter contract is deployed on the source chain, and contains logic in its mint function to send a CCIP Cross-Chain Message with the ABI-encoded mint function signature from the MyNFT.sol smart contract to the destination blockchain: function mint(\r\n        uint64 destinationChainSelector,\r\n        address receiver,\r\n        PayFeesIn payFeesIn\r\n    ) external {\r\n        Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message \u003d Client.EVM2AnyMessage({\r\n            receiver: abi.encode(receiver),\r\n            data: abi.encodeWithSignature(\"mint(address)\", msg.sender),\r\n            tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0),\r\n            extraArgs: \"\",\r\n            feeToken: payFeesIn \u003d\u003d PayFeesIn.LINK ? i_link : address(0)\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        uint256 fee \u003d IRouterClient(i_router).getFee(\r\n            destinationChainSelector,\r\n            message\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        bytes32 messageId;\r\n\r\n        if (payFeesIn \u003d\u003d PayFeesIn.LINK) {\r\n            LinkTokenInterface(i_link).approve(i_router, fee);\r\n            messageId \u003d IRouterClient(i_router).ccipSend(\r\n                destinationChainSelector,\r\n                message\r\n            );\r\n        } else {\r\n            messageId \u003d IRouterClient(i_router).ccipSend{value: fee}(\r\n                destinationChainSelector,\r\n                message\r\n            );\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        emit MessageSent(messageId);\r\n The DestinationMinter smart contract will receive the CCIP Cross-Chain Message with the ABI-encoded mint function signature as a payload, and call the mint function in the MyNFT smart contract function using it. The MyNFT smart contract will then mint the new NFT to the msg.sender account from the mint() function of the SourceMinter smart contract, i.e. to the same account address for which the NFT was minted on the source chain: function _ccipReceive(\r\n    Client.Any2EVMMessage memory message\r\n) internal override {\r\n    (bool success, ) \u003d address(nft).call(message.data);\r\n    require(success);\r\n    emit MintCallSuccessfull();\r\n}\r\n The end result is that the user that minted the NFT now owns the NFT on multiple chains, and they only had to mint and pay for it once. If the NFT project wants to remain strictly non-fungible even across blockchains, this solution can also be easily modified to mint the NFT on a destination blockchain and burn it on the source chain afterwards, ensuring there is only ever one version of it across all blockchains. The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the Cross-Chain NFT GitHub repository. Gaming: Cross-Chain Tic-Tac-Toe In the past couple of years, Web3 gaming has become massively popular. However, like DeFi, gaming is very fragmented, with games and their assets usually being specific to a certain chain. But like traditional gaming, the ultimate goal or best experience is when you have gamers that can play a game together, irrespective of the hardware or software they�re playing on. Just like how a PC gamer can play games with Xbox console owners, there should be no reason why someone can�t play a game on Polygon with someone playing on Avalanche. This is known as cross-platform gaming. This translates perfectly to turn-based Web3 games and other games that do not require fast real-time interaction. Web3 gaming suffers from user fragmentation, with gamers preferring to play on their chain of choice and use their preferred digital assets. CCIP enables Web3 games to be truly cross-chain, facilitating the transferring of assets across chains and enabling a shared game state across multiple blockchains, allowing gamers to play each other regardless of the chain they want to use. If you want to reach as many gamers as possible, then it makes sense to have your game deployed across multiple chains and design it in a way where all players can play against or with each other. A simple demonstration of this cross-chain gaming design pattern can be shown with a turn-based strategy game, such as Tic-Tac-Toe. In this example, we have a game smart contract that is deployed on multiple blockchains. Users can then start a game on their chain of choice and then share the game session ID with their friends. Their friends can then join the game from another chain if they wish. On game creation, CCIP will have shared the game details and initial state with all the other chains: struct GameSession {\r\n        bytes32 sessionId;\r\n        address player_1; // player who starts the game\r\n        address player_2; // the other player in the game\r\n        address winner; // winner of game\r\n        address turn; // check who takes action in next step\r\n        uint8[9] player1Status; // current status for player 1\r\n        uint8[9] player2Status; // current status for player 2\r\n    }\r\n    mapping(bytes32 \u003d\u003e GameSession) public gameSessions;\r\n    bytes32[] public sessionIds;\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction start(uint64 destinationChainSelector, address receiver) external {\r\n        bytes32 uniqueId \u003d keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, msg.sender));\r\n        sessionIds.push(uniqueId);\r\n        gameSessions[uniqueId]\u003d GameSession(\r\n            uniqueId,\r\n            msg.sender,\r\n            address(0),\r\n            address(0),\r\n            msg.sender,\r\n            initialCombination,\r\n            initialCombination\r\n            );\r\n\r\n        sendMessage(destinationChainSelector, receiver, gameSessions[uniqueId]);\r\n    }\r\n Once the first player has taken a turn after initiating the game, the second player on another blockchain will see the updated game state on their game smart contract once the CCIP message is successfully processed. Player 2 will then take their turn, which will generate a CCIP message to get sent back to player 1 and update the state of the game on their chain: function _ccipReceive(\r\n        Client.Any2EVMMessage memory any2EvmMessage\r\n    ) internal override {\r\n        bytes32 messageId \u003d any2EvmMessage.messageId; // fetch the messageId\r\n        uint64 sourceChainSelector \u003d any2EvmMessage.sourceChainSelector; // fetch the source chain identifier (aka selector)\r\n        address sender \u003d abi.decode(any2EvmMessage.sender, (address)); // abi-decoding of the sender address\r\n        GameSession memory message \u003d abi.decode(any2EvmMessage.data, (GameSession)); // abi-decoding of the sent string message\r\n        receivedMessages.push(messageId);\r\n        Message memory detail \u003d Message(sourceChainSelector, sender, message);\r\n        messageDetail[messageId] \u003d detail;\r\n        gameSessions[message.sessionId] \u003d message;\r\n        sessionIds.push(message.sessionId);\r\n\r\n        emit MessageReceived(messageId, sourceChainSelector, sender, message);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n function move(\r\n        uint256 x, \r\n        uint256 y, \r\n        uint256 player, \r\n        bytes32 sessionId, \r\n        uint64 destinationChainSelector,\r\n        address receiver) \r\n        public  \r\n    {\r\n        GameSession memory gs \u003d gameSessions[sessionId];\r\n        // make sure the game session setup and not over.\r\n        require(gs.player_1 !\u003d address(0), \"the session is not setup, please start game first!\");\r\n        require(gs.winner \u003d\u003d address(0), \"the game is over\");\r\n        \r\n        // make sure the player is in the game session\r\n        require(player \u003d\u003d 1 || player \u003d\u003d 2, \"you must be player1 or player2\"); //this is used to when player has the same address\r\n        \r\n        if(player \u003d\u003d 1) {\r\n            // make sure it is player1\u0027s turn to move\r\n            require(gs.player_1 \u003d\u003d msg.sender \u0026\u0026 gs.turn \u003d\u003d msg.sender, \"it is not your turn\");\r\n            \r\n            // 1. if the position is not taken by the opponent, then take the position\r\n            if(gs.player1Status[x * 3 + y] \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 gs.player2Status[x * 3 + y] \u003d\u003d 0) {\r\n               gameSessions[sessionId].player1Status[x * 3 + y] \u003d 1;\r\n               \r\n               // 2. check if player1 wins or make the turn to the opponent, send the message\r\n               if(checkWin(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(gameSessions[sessionId].player1Status)))) {\r\n                   gameSessions[sessionId].winner \u003d gameSessions[sessionId].player_1;\r\n               } else {\r\n                   gameSessions[sessionId].turn \u003d gameSessions[sessionId].player_2;\r\n               }\r\n               sendMessage(destinationChainSelector, receiver, gameSessions[sessionId]);\r\n            } else {\r\n                revert(\"the position is occupied\");\r\n            }\r\n        } else if(player \u003d\u003d 2) {\r\n            // make sure it is player2\u0027s turn to move, this is the first step for player2\r\n            require((gs.player_2 \u003d\u003d msg.sender \u0026\u0026 gs.turn \u003d\u003d msg.sender) || gs.player_2 \u003d\u003d address(0), \"it is not your turn\");\r\n\r\n            if(gs.player_2 \u003d\u003d address(0)) {\r\n                gameSessions[sessionId].player_2 \u003d msg.sender;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // 1. if the position is not taken by the opponent, then take the position\r\n            if(gs.player1Status[x * 3 + y] \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 gs.player2Status[x * 3 + y] \u003d\u003d 0) {\r\n               gameSessions[sessionId].player2Status[x * 3 + y] \u003d 1; \r\n\r\n               // 2. check if player1 wins or make the turn to the opponent, send the message\r\n               if(checkWin(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(gameSessions[sessionId].player2Status)))) {\r\n                   gameSessions[sessionId].winner \u003d gameSessions[sessionId].player_2;\r\n               } else {\r\n                   gameSessions[sessionId].turn \u003d gameSessions[sessionId].player_1;\r\n               }\r\n               sendMessage(destinationChainSelector, receiver, gameSessions[sessionId]);\r\n            } else {\r\n                revert(\"the position is occupied\");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n Player 1 will then see the updated game state and make their move once again. This back and forth of CCIP messages between chains will continue to happen as the gamers make their moves until the game reaches a conclusion and a winner is declared. The important thing to note here is that the game smart contracts on both chains both maintain the game state, with CCIP being used to send and receive messages to ensure game state is maintained across both blockchains: function checkWin(bytes32 combination) public view returns (bool) {\r\n        return wcs[combination];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /// @notice Sends data to receiver on the destination chain.\r\n    /// @dev Assumes your contract has sufficient native asset (e.g, ETH on Ethereum, MATIC on Polygon...).\r\n    /// @param destinationChainSelector The identifier (aka selector) for the destination blockchain.\r\n    /// @param receiver The address of the recipient on the destination blockchain.\r\n    /// @param message The string message to be sent.\r\n    /// @return messageId The ID of the message that was sent.\r\n    function sendMessage(\r\n        uint64 destinationChainSelector,\r\n        address receiver,\r\n        GameSession memory message\r\n    ) public returns (bytes32 messageId) {\r\n        // Create an EVM2AnyMessage struct in memory with necessary information for sending a cross-chain message\r\n        Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory evm2AnyMessage \u003d Client.EVM2AnyMessage({\r\n            receiver: abi.encode(receiver), // ABI-encoded receiver address\r\n            data: abi.encode(msg), // ABI-encoded string message\r\n            tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0), // Empty array indicating no tokens are being sent\r\n            extraArgs: Client._argsToBytes(\r\n                Client.EVMExtraArgsV1({gasLimit: 400_000, strict: false}) // Additional arguments, setting gas limit and non-strict sequency mode\r\n            ),\r\n            feeToken: address(0) // Setting feeToken to zero address, indicating native asset will be used for fees\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        // Initialize a router client instance to interact with cross-chain router\r\n        IRouterClient router \u003d IRouterClient(_router);\r\n\r\n        // Get the fee required to send the message\r\n        uint256 fees \u003d router.getFee(destinationChainSelector, evm2AnyMessage);\r\n\r\n        // Send the message through the router and store the returned message ID\r\n        messageId \u003d router.ccipSend{value: fees}(\r\n            destinationChainSelector,\r\n            evm2AnyMessage\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        // Emit an event with message details\r\n        emit MessageSent(\r\n            messageId,\r\n            destinationChainSelector,\r\n            receiver,\r\n            message,\r\n            fees\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        // Return the message ID\r\n        return messageId;\r\n    }\r\n The complete source code and instructions for this example can be found in the CCIP Tic-Tac-Toe GitHub repository.

    "content": "In Q1 2024, the SEC in its landmark judgment approved the listing and trading of a number of spot bitcoin ETFs � including those by BlackRock, Vanguard and Franklin Templeton. This was most certainly seen as a stepping-stone in bringing the crypto and traditional financial markets together � offering a regulated pathway for investment in digital assets.\n\nBut still not many investors from both Web3 and traditional investment backgrounds seem to fully understand the key differences between investing in bitcoin versus investing in bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhen you purchase bitcoin you gain full ownership and control over your assets (lest we forget with unlimited trading hours and potentially lower fees). But there are some downsides to be aware of. First, you need technical blockchain wallet know-how and an understanding of cryptoeconomics. Secondly, and more importantly, you can�t include your bitcoin investment in traditional retirement plans like 401(k)s.\n\nInvesting in bitcoin ETFs can also be advantageous for a few reasons: Ease of access, simplified investment, regulatory and security benefits, market integration, liquidity, diversification and potential tax benefits. The main downside is that you don�t really personally possess actual bitcoin. Add to this high management fees, operational costs, market hours limitation and potential tracking errors.\n\nBut what if there was a third option? One that combines the positives of both � direct bitcoin ownership and bitcoin ETFs � while also addressing their respective negatives? If you live in the United States, chances are that you have already heard of an IRA (short for �Individual Retirement Account�), a long-term, tax-advantaged savings account designed for individuals with earned income to save for retirement.\n\nIn recent years, IRAs have gone on to cover a broad spectrum � including cryptocurrencies, known as Crypto IRAs � a self-directed Individual Retirement Account (SDIRA) which allows investors to include digital currencies like bitcoin, ethereum and others in their retirement portfolios. And as more investors are flocking to Crypto IRAs in the middle of this ongoing bull run, it\u0027s quite evident that the future of retirement planning is becoming increasingly intertwined with the world of digital assets.\n\nInvesting in a Crypto IRA can offer several benefits and advantages: Tax-advantaged growth (either tax-deferred or tax-free), digital asset security and diversification. By incorporating cryptocurrencies into retirement savings, investors are bullish on adding this decentralized asset class to their portfolios � potentially maximizing the compounding effect of investments while minimizing immediate tax liabilities.\n\nLet\u0027s consider a simple example to illustrate the tax benefits. Say you buy $25,000 worth of bitcoin and it increases to $65,000. That\u0027s a $40,000 gain. While this sounds great, the issue is that these profits are now subject to capital gains tax. In comparison, if you buy $25,000 worth of bitcoin in a Roth IRA (with tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and its value increases to $65,000 you\u0027ve still made a $40,000 gain.\n\nAnd the best part is that when you sell in the future, you\u0027re not subject to capital gains tax and you can keep all of your profits.\n\nBut for crypto IRAs to pave the way for the future of retirement investing, we need a trustworthy, reliable and user-friendly approach. We need a solution that not only simplifies the process of buying and selling crypto through tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but also keeps costs low, stays transparent and makes investing in crypto assets with IRAs a walk in the park.\n\nOne such platform is iTrustCapital, led by CEO Kevin Maloney, a former compliance officer at the $2.5 trillion asset management firm PIMCO, and best known for working closely with regulatory agencies like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe platform has seen a surge in activity recently, with both an influx of new accounts being funded and a large number of holding accounts coming back to life, no doubt after reigniting their interest in the crypto space. Clients who were inactive during the bear market are now returning in droves � not just to check their accounts but to start transacting again.\n\nClients enjoy the flexibility of being able to buy and sell digital assets 24/7 � unlike ETFs which are only available for trading during market hours. This round-the-clock access allows investors to make decisions based on real-time market movements and their own investment strategies.\n\niTrustCapital offers a wide range of digital assets for investors to choose from � including popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum and a variety of altcoins. Such an approach allows investors to diversify their portfolios within the crypto space � potentially mitigating risk and capitalizing on emerging opportunities.\n\nAnother significant advantage is the ability to buy and sell within the account without creating a taxable event. Clients can buy and sell different digital assets and only incur a small fee, similar to other exchanges. This feature is particularly valuable for investors looking to rebalance their portfolios or take advantage of market fluctuations without worrying about immediate tax implications.\n\niTrustCapital also offers the option to move assets from other crypto IRAs into its platform. This flexibility allows investors who may be dissatisfied with the limited offerings or high fees from their current provider, to consolidate their crypto holdings under one roof. Thus, investors can enjoy an extensive range of digital assets and a competitive fee structure with iTrustCapital.\n\niTrustCapital has leveraged the regulated infrastructure of experienced third party compliance and custodial services in Web3. The company has done so by evaluating potential partners based on its deep domain knowledge, clean charters, excellent technology platforms and outstanding experience teams committed to doing the right thing. Ultimately, the company uses a regulated, state-chartered trust company to hold the self-directed IRAs and custody client assets.\n\nThe goal is to prioritize customer trust and safety around the purchase and safeguarding of their digital assets. In order to ensure reliability and peace of mind, iTrustCapital never takes custody of its clients\u0027 assets, nor does it leverage those assets for profit.\n\nMoreover, iTrustCapital holds clients\u0027 assets \"off-balance sheet,\" meaning that client assets are never actually recorded on the company\u0027s financial statements. By not including those assets, the company\u0027s business activities, its financial ratios and its overall leverage strategy remain unaffected by the amount of assets held for their clients. This approach demonstrates iTrustCapital\u0027s commitment to being fully transparent with its customer base and to continuously follow ethical practices.\n\nIncluding iTrustCapital in your IRA strategy means knowing that your assets are safe and secure with a company that puts the highest value on customer trust.\n\nLooking ahead, it\u0027s plausible that Crypto IRAs will become an increasingly common component of retirement portfolios. More investors are recognizing the potential benefits of including digital assets in their retirement portfolios � whether for diversification, long-term growth or as a hedge against traditional market volatility.\n\nAs younger generations who are more comfortable with digital assets begin to plan for their financial futures, platforms like iTrustCapital, through its wide range of digital assets and the security of a regulated custodian, will be well-positioned to capitalize on this growing demand for Crypto IRAs.\n\nIf you are looking for more information on how to start your crypto IRA with iTrustCapital, visit the website: https://www.itrustcapital.com/. iTrustCapital does not provide legal, investment or tax advice.

    "content": "BlackRock, Grayscale and Bitwise on Wednesday filed amended 9b-4 forms with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for their proposed spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nAll the updated forms removed the provisions for staking ether, which some say was causing a regulatory roadblock.\n\n�Neither the Trust, nor the Sponsor, nor the Ether Custodian [...] nor any other person associated with the Trust will, directly or indirectly, engage in action where any portion of the Trust�s ETH becomes subject to the Ethereum proof-of-stake validation or is used to earn additional ETH or generate income or other earnings,� the amended BlackRock filing said.\n\nStaking is the process of locking specific cryptocurrencies for a set period to help support the operation of a blockchain, in turn, for a reward. These rewards are considered mainly passive income among crypto traders.\n\nAs of Thursday, annualized yields on ether staking were nearly 3%, according to data from popular staking service Lido.\n\nAll ether ETF hopefuls have now filed their amended proposals ahead of an approval or disapproval decision expected on Thursday.\n\nFidelity filed its amended S-1 forms earlier this week, dropping its staking plans. Later, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Invesco Galaxy and ARK 21Shares filed similar amendments to remove staking. Hashdex is the only issuer yet to file an amendment to its Ethereum ETF.\n\nAs such, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has started listing VanEck�s Ether ETF under the ticker symbol ETHV on its site, which some take as a positive sign.\n\nOn Monday, influential Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart updated their odds of approval to 75% from the earlier 25%, causing a market-wide jump. Ether rose over 17%, while bitcoin retook the $71,000 mark for the first time since early April.\n\nMarket watchers have described the move as a sudden change in tone for the SEC, which was earlier said not to be considering the approval of an ether ETF. In an interview with Unchained, Seyffart said the issue had become �political,� with the decision coming �from above, likely Biden.�\n\n",

    "content": "A bunch of Ethereum ecosystem tokens rocketed in the past 24 hours after two Bloomberg analysts raised their odds on the approval of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.\n\nThe cat-themed mog (MOG) token, a reference to a popular TikTok meme, rose nearly 50% while the frog-themed pepe (PEPE) surged more than 20%. Both were initially issued on Ethereum in 2023 and have since become mainstays, alongside bigger ones such as dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB).\n\nAmong utility projects, staking application Lido�s LDO rose 15%, while the ARB token of Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Arbitrum jumped 18%. DOGE and SHIB added 6%.\n\nMeme tokens have been increasingly seen as a leveraged way to bet on the growth of their underlying blockchain. The gains came after Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart updated the odds of approval to 75% from 20% on Monday, causing a market-wide jump. Ether rose over 17%, while bitcoin retook the $71,000 mark for the first time since early April.\n\n�Established memes are generally high beta for the native token of the chain they�re on, and Mog has established itself as a winner on Ethereum while still trading at a fraction of the next biggest meme (Pepe),� a Mog core team member said in an interview over Telegram.\n\n�I think the market sees that there�s quite a lot of room to catch up to Pepe, and that�s why you see the outperformance. If you think memes are good beta; you�ll go for the higher caps like pepe or you�ll slide further down the curve for mog.�\n\nThe focus on meme coins as a way of betting on growth isn\u0027t unique to Ethereum. Several Solana-based meme coin tokens surged from December to March as the network�s SOL tokens took off � contributing to ecosystem growth and attention. Also in December, the Avalanche Foundation, a non-profit that maintains the Avalanche blockchain, said it would invest in meme tokens built on the network in recognition of the online culture and memetic value that such tokens can drive among investors.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "As AI continues to work itself into our daily lives, it\u0027s hard not to see the impact it\u0027s already having on nearly every sector. Within the finance industry, for example, AI is facilitating smarter investments, analyzing market trends and predicting stock performance, ultimately helping individuals and institutions make more informed business decisions.\n\nWhile most of the advancements with AI are exciting and continue to push different industries forward, there are those abusing the technology for more nefarious purposes. With generative AI, one of the biggest risks that individuals and organizations need to be aware of are called �deepfakes.�\n\nYou\u0027re reading Crypto Long \u0026 Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nDeepfakes are highly realistic digital forgeries produced with AI to manipulate or generate visual and/or audio content. For example, a deepfake might involve an AI-generated video showing a celebrity engaging in actions or making statements that never actually occurred, such as when comedian Jordan Peele created a deepfake of Barack Obama to showcase the threat AI-generated technology could present.\n\nWhile we may default to believing what we see, this type of forged or deceptive AI-generated content is becoming increasingly more common. Between 2022 and the first half of 2023, deepfakes as a proportion of content in the U.S. increased almost 13 times from 0.2% to 2.6%, according to a recent report from Sumsub Research.\n\nExperts are already concerned deepfakes could be used to try to sway public opinion or influence important events like elections, with bad actors trying to use AI to impersonate elected officials. They are �completely terrified� that the upcoming Presidential race will involve a �tsunami of misinformation,� driven heavily by deepfake and misleading AI-generated content, another recent report noted. Many view deepfakes� ability to blur the lines between truth and fiction as a fundamental threat to democracies and fair elections around the globe.\n\nSo how do we � as a society � mitigate the prevalence and risks of deepfakes, as well as similar risks that may emerge as generative AI only continues to get more sophisticated?\n\nBlockchains could be the crucial technology we need to help tackle this issue. At their core, public blockchains, such as Ethereum, have several key features that make them uniquely positioned to establish authenticity for content and information. This includes blockchain�s inherent transparency, decentralized nature and focus on network security and immutability.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, a public blockchain transparently records information in a time-bound manner, accessible to all, globally, and without gatekeeping. This allows anyone to verify the validity of information, such as its creator or a timestamp, making it a source of truth. Public blockchains are also decentralized, eliminating the need for a central decision-maker, and reducing the risk of manipulation. This decentralized structure also offers high network security by eliminating single points of failure, and ensuring an immutable and tamper-resistant record.\n\nFurthermore, blockchains have already demonstrated their ability to authenticate content. For instance, with digital art as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain tech allows anyone to verify the creator and owner of a piece of art, enabling our ability to distinguish between the original and its potential replicas. This transparency and authentication potential extends to videos, images, and text, providing important foundations for developers to create solutions and tools geared at combating deepfakes, such as OpenAI�s Worldcoin, Irys and Numbers Protocol.\n\nAs AI\u0027s impact on society grows, AI-generated content and deepfakes will only become more prominent. Harvard experts already predict that more than 90% of content online will be AI-generated in the future. To protect against threats such as deepfakes, it\u0027s crucial we get ahead of the issue and implement innovative solutions. Public blockchains, collectively owned and operated by users, offer promising features like network security, transparency, and decentralization which can help against the issues deepfakes present.\n\nHowever, much of the work underway remains in its early stages, and challenges remain with the technical development and widespread adoption of blockchain-related protocols. While there is no quick fix, we must remain committed to shaping a future that upholds truth, integrity, and transparency, as our society navigates these emerging technologies (and the risks they present) together.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\n",

    "content": "A sudden jolt of optimism over the prospect that U.S. regulators might soon approve spot Ethereum ETFs has sent the ETH price soaring � up 21% this week in its best performance since August 2021.\n\nBut beneath the surface, there\u0027s been tension in the Ethereum developer community over the largest smart-contracts blockchain\u0027s future and progress toward decentralization. The sniping became especially acute with the revelations this week that two of the Ethereum Foundation\u0027s biggest stars have accepted multimillion-dollar token incentive packages from EigenLayer, the pioneering restaking protocol that has been flagged as possibly posing a systemic risk to Ethereum.

It\u0027s not clear exactly what started it all, but top Ethereum developers locked horns on the social-media platform X, in an intense and almost uncomfortable-to-observe debate touching on the practice of maximal extractable value, or MEV � essentially, the use of sophisticated trading bots to frontrun user transactions at the point of execution. On May 16, Ethereum core developer P�ter Szil�gyi tweeted about his despair over the lack of progress in pushing to solve some of the blockchain\u0027s most vexing issues. \"Voila, the banking system recreated,\" he wrote. One of his points was that Ethereum had \"glorified\" MEV, remarking, ostensibly in sarcasm, that it was \"futile to fight against MEV, so might as well lean hard on it, right?\" (As chronicled in last week\u0027s issue of The Protocol, even U.S. government officials now appear to characterize MEV as standard operating procedure on the blockchain.) Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist retweeted Szil�gyi\u0027s post with the comment, \"This is such a lazy take if you can\u0027t also tell me what your supposed solutions are that let local block producers extract MEV.\" A back-and-forth ensued, and then Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin chimed in, tweeting that \"I\u0027m really proud that Ethereum does not have any culture of trying to prevent people from speaking their minds, even when they have very negative feelings toward major things in the protocol or ecosystem.\" Buterin, who is known to write long, interrupted his work on a project in Kenya to bang out a 3,000-word-plus essay breaking down the issues, concluding: \"I also do not think that the situation is anywhere near as hopeless as Peter\u0027s tweets imply.\"\n\nET TU, DANKRAD? The Buterin tweet referenced in that ^^^ episode touched off an entirely separate donnybrook. The pseudonymous crypto influencer Cobie responded to Buterin\u0027s tweet, asking the very pointed question of how he felt about \"core developers or researchers taking life�changing $ packages from projects built on Ethereum to become \u0027advisors,\u0027 when those projects may have conflicted incentives with Ethereum, either now or in the future.\" At first it wasn\u0027t quite clear what the comment referred to. But then, as reported by CoinDesk\u0027s Margaux Nijkerk, a top Ethereum Foundation developer, Justin Drake, disclosed that he had taken on a role advising EigenFoundation, with \"a significant token incentive which could easily be worth more than the combined value of all my other assets (mostly ETH),\" and a value of \"millions of dollars of tokens vesting over 3 years.\" EigenFoundation supports the restaking protocol EigenLayer, a controversial project partly because experts have warned of its potential systemic risks to the Ethereum blockchain. Shortly after that, Feist (also mentioned ^^^) confessed that he, too, had accepted a paid role at EigenFoundation. The news set off a debate on crypto twitter about whether advising the EigenFoundation would constitute a conflict of interest. \"Even if you pinky promise to not let this cloud your judgment, and do it on a personal capacity, that\u0027s impossible,\" wrote Lefteris Karapetsas. One clever jokester deadpanned that the Ethererum researchers were \"restaking themselves now.\"\n\nALSO:\n\nTop picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.\n\nThroughput-Latency graph comparing Mysticeti-C performance with state-of-the-art consensus protocols (Arxiv)\n\n1.

    "content": "The ratio between ether (ETH) and bitcoin�s (BTC) dollar-denominated prices continues to slide, extending year-to-date losses as suggested by the bearish death cross pattern a month ago.\n\nETH/BTC slipped to 0.04563 on crypto exchange Binance soon before press time, reaching the lowest since April 2021, according to charting platform TradingView. This year, the ratio has declined nearly 16%, indicating a bias for bitcoin or the leading cryptocurrency by market value.\n\nThe slide to three-year lows follows reduced demand for exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to ether.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data quoted by ETC Group in its weekly report, global ether ETPs registered net outflows of around $63.5 million last week, with Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) losing the most. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETPs raked in $92.5 million last week.\n\nSeveral factors, including competing layer 1s and lingering uncertainty about the debut of spot ETH approvals in the U.S, are likely responsible for ETH falling out of investor favor.\n\n�The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has reinforced bitcoin�s store-of-value narrative and its status as a macro asset. On the other hand, open questions about ETH�s fundamental positioning within the crypto sector remain. Competing layer-1s (L1s) like Solana detract from Ethereum�s positioning as the \u0027go-to\u0027 network for decentralized app (dApp) deployment,� Coinbase Institutional�s Research analyst David Han said in a note Wednesday.\n\nSolana�s share in total decentralized exchange volumes has grown tenfold from 2% to 21% in one year, eating into Ethereum\u0027s market share.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighted nearly a dozen spot BTC ETFs in January. Since then, these funds have drawn roughly $12 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors.\n\nApproval of spot ETFs tied to ether will open a similar pool of capital for Ethereum�s native token, although it�s unclear when the SEC will approve it.\n\nTraders on decentralized betting platform Polymarket see just a 10% chance of the SEC approving a spot ETF on or before May 31. The regulator has until May 23 to decide whether to approve or reject VanEck�s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF. The deadline for BlackRock�s application is June 23.\n\nAccording to finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, the SEC is looking for reasons to deny ETH ETF applications by BlackRock and others on grounds that they have been improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they hold a security.\n\nIlan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said ether is a \"lightning rod\" for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots.\n\n�Capital gets fragmented. There are proportionally greater numbers of ways to get exposure to the ecosystem through the many Layer 2s tokens (OP, ARB�) and native protocol tokens in each one. The capital gets fragmented,\" Solot said in an email.\n\nSolot added that strong anti-ETH sentiment from [rival] Solana community and Bitcoin propounders is driving negative ether narratives and the high beta cryptocurrency is a \"perfect vehicle\" for external players to express bearish view given it trades on traditional exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nLastly, Ether recently turned inflationary, reversing the bullish deflationary supply trend seen consistently since its parent network Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus ecosystem in September 2022.\n\n",

    "content": "As bitcoin (BTC) continues to gain traction worldwide, the approach to introducing it to newcomers plays a crucial role in its widespread adoption. While some advocates firmly believe in a \"Bitcoin only\" narrative, this aggressive stance can often hinder the conversation and deter potential adopters.\n\nInstead, a \"Bitcoin first\" approach, which prioritizes education and understanding, may prove more effective in fostering genuine interest and long-term investment in bitcoin.\n\nBurak Tamac is an adjunct professor at Montclair State University, teaching politics and technology.\n\nThis essay is part of CoinDesk�s �Future of Bitcoin� package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin �halving� in April 2024.\n\nProponents of the \"Bitcoin only\" narrative often argue passionately for the superiority of bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies. However, this approach can come across as confrontational and off-putting to those who are new to the concept. When people feel attacked or told that their current investments are wrong, they are more likely to disengage from the conversation entirely. This is particularly true in countries like Turkey, where many individuals are already familiar with alternative investments like altcoins.\n\nTo effectively promote bitcoin adoption, the focus should shift from telling people what to do to providing them with the knowledge to make informed decisions. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in understanding the broader cryptocurrency landscape, educators can help people grasp the unique features and advantages of bitcoin without disparaging other investments outright.\n\nWhen individuals learn about the Bitcoin network\u0027s decentralized nature, its limited supply and its potential as a store of value, they can better appreciate its significance. This foundation of knowledge allows them to evaluate other cryptocurrencies more critically and recognize the authenticity of bitcoin\u0027s value proposition.\n\nSee also: Allen Farrington: Capital in the 21st Century | Opinion\n\nEncouraging people to blindly invest in bitcoin without proper understanding is a short-sighted approach. When individuals buy bitcoin solely based on hype or fear of missing out, they are more likely to panic sell during market fluctuations. This behavior not only harms their personal financial well-being but also discourages them to learn more about bitcoin.\n\nIn contrast, when people invest in bitcoin after learning about its fundamentals and long-term potential, they are more likely to hold their investments through market cycles. This informed decision-making promotes stability and helps to build a stronger, more resilient Bitcoin community.\n\nTo accelerate bitcoin adoption, I believe advocates should prioritize education to start a conversation; and the education should not start about what they do wrong, but what they can do more. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy and technological understanding, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers.\n\nBy adopting a \"Bitcoin first\" approach that prioritizes education and understanding, we can create a more welcoming and empowering environment for newcomers. This shift in narrative, from \"Bitcoin only\" to \"Bitcoin first,\" has the potential to accelerate adoption.\n\n",

    "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. � U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler declined on Thursday to preview his agency\u0027s decision on ether (ETH) exchange traded funds (ETFs), though he advised observers to \"stay tuned.\"\n\nThough he\u0027d reiterated that the court decision on ETFs had caused his agency to \"pivot\" in its thinking, when asked by CoinDesk on Thursday about what the agency is preparing to do in response to the specific applications on this much-anticipated crypto decision, he largely demurred.\n\n\"I don\u0027t have anything on this particular filing,\" Gensler said outside an Investment Company Institute event in Washington.\n\n\"We do it within the law and how the courts interpret the law, and that\u0027s what I\u0027m deeply committed to,\" he said, after having noted on stage at the event that the agency had responded to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision rejecting the SEC\u0027s approach toward spot bitcoin (BTC) ETFs earlier this year.\n\nThe SEC, after weeks of limited engagement, asked exchanges supporting spot ether ETF applications to refile their 19b-4 forms with universal language earlier this week. Those forms were submitted to the SEC by Tuesday, and the exchanges began publishing them online that night. The SEC also appears to have begun engaging with the would-be issuers themselves, as companies like Fidelity and Grayscale filed updated S-1 forms this week. The SEC has to make a final decision on at least one spot ether ETF application by the end of the day Thursday.\n\nBased on these forms, it appears the SEC is uncomfortable with the idea that ether ETF issuers might stake any assets.\n\nIndustry participants previously told CoinDesk that while the SEC\u0027s moves this week don\u0027t guarantee approval of the ETFs, they make it more likely that the ETFs will be approved.\n\n\"[The] DC Circuit took a different view, and we took that into consideration and pivoted,\" Gensler said on Thursday.\n\nGensler also reiterated Thursday that his agency would keep working on its opposition to the crypto bill that passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday.\n\n\"We\u0027ll continue to engage,\" he said. \"It\u0027s just a field where the token operators � without prejudging any one of them � aren\u0027t making the disclosures that investors really could benefit from and are required by law.\"\n\n\"We\u0027ve seen leaders in this field find themselves on a pathway to jail or extradition,\" he added.\n\nAnd when asked about Congress seeking to reverse his agency\u0027s crypto accounting policy, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), he argued that the agency meant it as guidance at a time when failing crypto firms were having to treat customer assets the same as their own in bankruptcy.\n\n\"The crypto that these companies have said they took as custody actually because part of the bankruptcy estate,\" Gensler said. \"That\u0027s what we were addressing back in 2022,\" he added, saying it was \"just\" an accounting bulletin.\n\nRead more: SEC\u0027s Gensler Going Rogue in Solo Quest to Stop U.S. Crypto Legislation?\n\n",

    "summary": "There is a 90% probability the SEC will approve a spot ether ETF, one observer said, drawing attention to the narrowed discount in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.\n\n",
    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) consolidated recent gains early Thursday, lacking a clear directional bias before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u0027s (SEC) decision on VanEck\u0027s spot ether ETF application, due later in the day.\n\nBTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded little changed around $69,500, and ether, the No. 2, held steady near $3,700, according to CoinDesk data.\n\nStill, technical analysis and market positioning indicate a bullish undertone. Both cryptocurrencies maintained a strong position above their respective Ichimoku cloud lines, suggesting a bullish outlook, an interpretation echoed by analyst Josh Olszewicz on X. Further evidence came from derivatives exchange Deribit, where options on bitcoin and ether continued to reveal a bias for calls, or derivatives that allow traders to profit from price rises, according to data tracked by Amberdata.\n\nThe bullish positioning is likely to have stemmed from increased expectations the SEC will approve spot ether ETFs, broadening the demand for cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"The SEC should approve U.S.-listed ETH ETFs today. Hours before the Bitcoin ETF approval, SEC Gensler tweeted that crypto investors should consider all potential risks before making any investment. Today, a tweet could come around 9 a.m. ET. and would provide more clarity on whether approval would be imminent,\" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients.\n\nThielen added that the Grayscale Ethereum Trust\u0027s discount to net asset value has narrowed to just 8% from 30% a week ago, implying at least \"a 90% probability that an ETF would be approved.\"\n\nThe change follows reports early this week that the SEC had asked for updates and amendments from spot ether ETF applicants, signaling potential approval.\n\n\"If spot ether ETFs are approved, that signals a sharp change in the official attitude toward the crypto industry � it also looks like hostility toward FIT21 is not as strong as we had feared,\" Noelle Acheson, author of the popular Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, told CoinDesk, referring to the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the act, which will clearly define whether cryptocurrencies are commodities or securities. Categorization as securities would mean a stringent SEC oversight. The legislation is also expected to establish the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a leading regulator of digital assets alongside the SEC.\n\nThe bill now moves to the Senate, where its future is uncertain. Even if passed, President Joe Biden could still veto it.\n\nShares in the Nasdaq-listed chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) reached a record high during Wednesday\u0027s post-market hours after the company beat analyst estimates to report record revenue of $26.04 billion for the first quarter.\n\nThe rally might be a positive signal for cryptocurrencies, including tokens supposedly associated with artificial intelligence (AI) technology. That\u0027s because, historically, the inflow of money into the crypto market and the so-called AI coins has been partly contingent on outsized gains in NVDA and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index.\n\nAccording to Coingecko, top AI coins, such as FET, ICP, RNDR and GRT, traded mixed at the time of writing, having rallied in the lead-up to the NVDA announcement.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Lawmakers are set to vote on the FIT21 bill Wednesday afternoon.\n\n",
    "content": "The U.S. House of Representatives is poised to vote in favor of a crypto market structure bill for the first time, in a symbolic effort to radically reshape the country\u0027s digital asset regulatory landscape.\n\nThe Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, sponsored by members of the House Financial Services and House Agriculture Committees, will begin seeing votes Wednesday afternoon, where it is expected to pass with a bipartisan majority.\n\nThe bill, dubbed FIT21, would grant the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) greater spot-market authority over digital assets deemed to be commodities, while also creating new jurisdictional lines for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Crypto companies and digital asset issuers would have a framework for determining whether and how their assets are securities under the terms defined by the bill, which in turn would let them know who their primary regulator could be.\n\nRep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who chairs the Financial Services Committee, told reporters on Tuesday that he hoped for \"a substantial vote\" in favor of the legislation to demonstrate that there is real momentum for digital asset legislation, a week after the Senate voted in favor of a House resolution that overturned SEC accounting guidance.\n\nThe bill is expected to pass, with a handful of Democrats joining a majority of Republicans in voting in favor of the bill. The bill\u0027s path through the Senate is less clear, and the White House earlier Wednesday said it opposed the legislation, though President Joe Biden did not threaten a veto.\n\nThe bill has been the subject of a large amount of discussion in recent days.\n\nRep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), one of at least nine Democrat lawmakers who said they would support the bill, said he \"look[ed] forward to working with my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee on our continued oversight of this issue.\"\n\n\"FIT21 is an important step forward in the regulation of the cryptocurrency industry and a meaningful improvement on the status quo,\" he said in a statement.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) announced he would vote in favor of the bill shortly before the vote on Wednesday, saying \"we need blockchain innovation here in America.\"\n\nRep. French Hill (R-Ark.) told reporters on Tuesday that the bill creates a \"5-step test on whether something is a decentralized blockchain or not,\" and includes a roadmap for the regulator to utilize.\n\nIn comments to the House Rules Committee, he said the lawmakers who developed the bill had engaged with regulators � including the SEC � for more than a year, incorporating their feedback to the legislation.\n\n\"We included provisions to mitigate conflicts of interest. We impose capital and other necessary requirements on intermediaries. And we impose higher standards for custody,\" he said.\n\nThere\u0027s an interim process as well, where companies need to file a \"notice of intent to register\" with the agencies, he said.\n\nRead more: Democrat House Leadership Says Crypto Bill Vote Won\u0027t Be Whipped\n\nOpposition to the bill, however, starts within the House Financial Services Committee itself.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the committee, dubbed the bill the \"not fit for purpose act\" and told the House Rules Committee on Tuesday that it \"is perhaps the worst, most harmful deregulatory proposal I have seen in a long time,\" likening it to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. The CFMA, Waters charged, deregulated certain derivatives products which later \"blew up our economy when AIG collapsed.\"\n\nFIT21 does not give the CFTC greater authority to target fraud or other crimes, despite directing the agency to oversee digital commodities, she said. The bill also sunsets disclosure requirements after 180 days, meaning the regulator cannot force companies it\u0027s supposed to regulate to provide audited financial statements past that deadline.\n\n\"What is even more problematic is the bill�s definition of quote \u0027investment contract assets,\u0027\" she said. \"Securities that meet this definition would be transferred into a regulatory void, with no primary regulator and virtually no laws and regulations to speak of. Importantly, the definition of investment contract asset is not limited to crypto, and it would be fairly easy for both crypto and traditional securities to be formatted to meet this definition.\"\n\nA group of unions, consumer protection organizations, academics and others sent a public letter to House Speaker Michael Johnson (R-La.) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) asking them to vote against the bill and laying out a list of concerns similar to Gensler\u0027s.\n\nThe letter took aim at the industry more broadly, saying crypto \"still struggles to demonstrate viable use cases outside of speculative investment\" and referencing the various ongoing bankruptcies and civil and criminal litigation.\n\n\"The industry has superficially recovered this year, in part due to controversial approval of spot BTC ETPs by the Securities Exchange Commission,\" the letter said. \"Yet, the scams, hacks, theft, instability, reckless promotional activities, and regulatory evasion that were present during the last crypto bull market remain endemic in the industry today.\"\n\nThe letter was signed by organizations including the AFL-CIO, Americans for Financial Reform, Revolving Door Project, the National Consumer Law Center and over 30 others as well as 10 individuals.\n\nEchoing Gensler, the groups said they are concerned the bill would weaken existing securities laws to the point where even non-crypto companies could \"evade more rigorous oversight\" by tying themselves to a decentralized network (or at least claiming they were tied to a decentralized network). While the bill gives the CFTC greater authority, the letter said this authority \"is vague,\" to the point it could undermine other agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n\"All told, we believe this bill as written introduces a policy \u0027cure\u0027 that would be far worse than the disease and create significant harm within and far beyond the crypto industry,\" the letter said.\n\nAdvocates for the bill argue that legislation is needed to support companies\u0027 efforts to \"build a better financial services system and better internet.\"\n\n\"Since the inception of the Bitcoin network in 2009, the blockchain and digital asset industry has existed without targeted market regulation,\" a letter filed by the Blockchain Association, a lobby group, said. \"The absence of clear rules leads to confusion in the marketplace for companies � and leaves users and consumers unprotected.\"\n\nRead more: Crypto Industry Rallies Behind House Bill as It Heads Toward Final Vote\n\nThe letter, signed by groups including stablecoin issuer Circle, Ethereum incubator ConsenSys, venture capital firm Digital Currency Group, exchanges such as Kraken and 50 other companies in the sector, went on to argue that the \"lack of clarity\" risked putting the U.S. behind in \"the global technology race.\"\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler published a statement on Wednesday opposing the legislation. In it, he raised the specter of crypto\u0027s various collapses and frauds, suggesting the bill might allow even traditional pump and dumpers or penny stock pushers to escape oversight by branding themselves as using decentralized networks.\n\n\"We should make the policy choice to protect the investing public over facilitating business models of noncompliant firms,\" he said.\n\n",

If cryptocurrencies get support from the global risk appetite on Friday, Bitcoin could exceed $70K over the weekend,� shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in a note to CoinDesk, referring to increased inflows from spot ETFs.\n\n�A test of the $71K-$74K highs area, in our view, could happen as early as early next week, triggering a new episode of FOMO,� Kuptsikevich.\n\nSingapore-based QCP Capital gave out similar price targets in a client note earlier this week.\n\nSuch bullish outlooks come as U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the asset have logged four straight days of inflows, ending Thursday at $257 million in net inflows. This is a nearly 180-degree turn from the action of the past few weeks � with some of the biggest ETFs seeing zero inflows on some days.\n\nBlackRock�s IBIT received $94 million in inflows on Thursday, the largest among peers. GrayScale�s GBTC, which has mostly seen outflows since its January listing, received over $4.6 million in inflows.\n\nEarlier this week, multiple regulatory filings showed that several big-name funds, such as Millennium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios.\n\nThe softer-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggered a break out of the range for BTC on Wednesday.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "BlockFi, a crypto lending company, was founded in October 2017 and filed for bankruptcy just over five years later in the wake of FTX\u0027s collapse.\n\n",
    "content": "Crypto lender BlockFi is kaput. The platform, which offered high yields on crypto deposits, has filed for bankruptcy protection. It�s the latest company to fall after the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Indeed, bankruptcy filings show that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. But how did it all go so wrong? CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture.\n\nZac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company�s chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral.\n\nVenture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz�s Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer.\n\nFlush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it \"doesn�t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.� As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn�t seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company.\n\nThe firm�s next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel�s Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts.\n\nIn December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood�s business model. �Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,� BlockFi�s CEO said.\n\nPeter Thiel�s Valar Ventures led BlockFi�s $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping �BlockFi expand into Singapore� and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nBlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to �crypto payment rails� such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by �requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren\u0027t already cryptocurrency owners.� The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform.\n\nAll was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee�s phone with a �SIM swap� that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee�s phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi�s retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi�s customers.\n\nIn August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors.\n\nIn October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale�s Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk\u0027s parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020.\n\nBlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin.\n\nEarly in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale�s product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nAll was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin�s soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong?\n\nNew Jersey�s Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state�s financial regulator claimed BlockFi�s interest accounts amounted to sales of an �unregistered security� and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers.\n\nThe CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that � and it didn�t end well for BlockFi (we�ll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card.\n\nIn February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. �Today�s settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,� SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.\n\nIn June, BlockFi�s valuation sank to $1 billion in a �down round� � a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund\u0027s collateral before its bankruptcy. In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi�s main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nIn dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren�t met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S.\n\nAt the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11.\n\nThat was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX�s credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid �the lack of clarity� about FTX. On Nov. 11, California�s financial regulator revoked BlockFi�s lending license.\n\nBlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried\u0027s Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan.\n\nIn the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX. All the while, one question looms: Will customers get anything back?\n\nRead More: Latest BlockFi Stories\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A new White House statement suggests not even the president who appointed the SEC chairman thinks the government can go on overseeing digital assets without new policy.\n\n",
    "content": "The White House is \"eager\" to work on a crypto bill. That was the sentiment of its latest statement on Wednesday, putting the administration on-the-record again about wanting new digital assets policies to protect investors.\n\nBut U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler � the securities watchdog President Joe Biden hired as a member of his transition team and a key regulator � says don\u0027t bother. Gensler\u0027s strong view that existing laws give his agency plenty of authority seems to go against other U.S. regulatory agencies, the White House and its Treasury Department.\n\nGensler, in a statement he issued against the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) on Wednesday � as the bill heads toward a vote that\u0027s expected to count a significant number of Democratic supporters � accused crypto firms again of showing \"their unwillingness to comply with applicable laws and regulations for more than a decade, variously arguing that the laws do not apply to them or that a new set of rules should be created and retroactively applied to them to excuse their past conduct.\"\n\n\"The crypto industry�s record of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies is not because we don\u0027t have rules or because the rules are unclear,\" Gensler argued. \"It�s because many players in the crypto industry don�t play by the rules.\"\n\nBiden\u0027s White House may not like FIT21 either, but a policy statement the same morning said the administration is \"eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities.\"\n\nRep. French Hill (R-Ark.) said in a CoinDesk TV interview on Wednesday that many House Democrats \"recognize that the existing Securities and Exchange Commission rules are inadequate.\" Hill added that FIT21 is trying to give Gensler\u0027s agency a roadmap for handling this sector.\n\n\"I cannot explain why he\u0027s taken the position that he had,\" Hill said. \"I think he\u0027s isolated from other regulatory leaders.\"\n\nThe SEC didn\u0027t immediately respond to a request Wednesday to comment on whether Gensler sees himself at odds with fellow government officials.\n\nThe SEC\u0027s sister agency in policing the U.S. markets, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC), has taken a strong pro-legislation position, arguing that existing law leaves a hole in oversight of the crypto spot markets for non-securities, such as bitcoin (BTC). CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam has told lawmakers that \"Congress needs to act\" on crypto legislation, and he\u0027s said that if FIT21 passes, his agency can build a regulatory framework within 12 months. A CFTC spokesperson told CoinDesk on Tuesday that the agency would not comment on the bill.\n\nConsumer-protection groups seem to be in Gensler\u0027s corner on this, and Mark Hays, a senior policy analyst for Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress, dismissed the apparent contrasts among different corners of the federal government.\n\n\"It reflects slightly different takes on what\u0027s important and the \u0027art\u0027 of what\u0027s possible in politics,\" he told CoinDesk in an email. The regulators \"all have different tools to address crypto regulation matters. Some of them have exercised that role effectively; others could do more.\"\n\nThe spot-markets gap could be filled by separate legislation naming the SEC its regulator, said Hays, who argued that in matters of investor protection the SEC\u0027s view should get some deference, despite the CFTC \"playing the spoiler.\" His groups are among dozens of organizations opposing FIT21 on consumer-protection grounds.\n\nThe federal courts � despite Gensler\u0027s contention that judges have agreed with his agency \"time and again\" on crypto matters � haven\u0027t yet provided consistent answers on whether tokens should be treated as securities, and the final say may still need to come from the U.S. Supreme Court. So, it\u0027s a race between Congress and the courts on who will define how tokens such as bitcoin, Ethereum\u0027s ether (ETH), tether (USDT) and solana (SOL) should be handled in the U.S.\n\nAmong other government voices clamoring for crypto legislation, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said earlier this year that \"Congress should pass legislation to provide for the regulation of stablecoins and of the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities.\" The Treasury interest in the spot markets and illicit finance doesn\u0027t leave a clear picture yet on exactly what the administration\u0027s financial arm would be interested in for crypto oversight, though the White House has certainly indicated that FIT21 isn\u0027t it.\n\nBut whether the government likes it or not, that\u0027s the first crypto bill that will receive a vote in one of the chambers of Congress, leaving it as the most prominent piece of digital assets legislation in the conversation.\n\n\"We\u0027re disappointed that Chairman Gensler doesn\u0027t see that this is better than current law and gives him the tools, ability, and a process that can allow him to be a better regulator and a better supervisor in this space,\" Hill said.\n\nRead More: SEC\u0027s Gensler Says House Bill Would \u0027Undermine\u0027 Regulator\u0027s Crypto, Capital Markets Oversight\n\n",

Users on X and Reddit largely seemed to consider the image as a sign to lock into trading markets.\n\nStocks related to Gill and other �meme stocks,� surged. GME prices were up as high as 44% in pre-market trading, and surged as high as 100% on market open before trading was halted. Cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE: AMC) was up 12% in pre-market, rising to as much as 30% after open.\n\nAn unaffiliated GameStop meme coin on the Solana blockchain surged more than 550%, DEXTools data shows, while an AMC token jumped 1,200%. Some microcap cat-themed meme coins such as kitty (KITTY) rose thousands of percent, while larger tokens popcat (POPCAT) and mog (MOG) rose over 15%. Larger-cap meme coins (DOGE) and (SHIB) were higher by 5% and 7%, respectively.\n\nData shows that opportunistic developers issued a slew of tokens referring to Gill, TheRoaringKitty, GameStop, and �stonks� � a meme term for stocks�in the past 24 hours.\n\nGill�s analysis of the video game retailer GameStop on Reddit, starting in 2019 and gaining traction during the COVID pandemic, created a viral phenomenon at the time. It was largely cited as a driving factor in the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021 as several small-time traders banded together and purchased options and leveraged shares of the company.\n\nThe stock rose from $4 to over $120 in a month and, at its peak, was up thousands of percent from its lifetime low of 64 cents in April 2020.\n\nGill�s initial $53,000 investment was worth nearly $50 million at its peak, emerging as a rags-to-riches story of a lone trader making a fortune from his bedroom by betting against hedge funds. One of the most prolific losers was Melvin Capital, a fund that lost billions of dollars betting on the decline of meme stocks, among other bets that move against it.\n\n",

There was no apparent catalyst for the jumps.\n\nTokens of layer-1 blockchains, such as ether (ETH), Solana�s SOL and Avalanche�s AVAX, were among the worst-performing categories, with an average rise of 5.5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index of major tokens, minus stablecoins, rose nearly 6%.\n\nOn-chain analysis tool Lookonchain said in an X post that whales, a colloquial term for wealthy traders whose actions can move token prices, picked up millions of dollars worth of meme tokens cat in a dogs world (MEW) and slerf (SLERF).

Another person said the exact Bitcoin functionality is not yet set in stone, but features could initially be limited and expanded over time.\n\nMetaMask\u0027s Ethereum wallet is the gateway for more than 30 million monthly active users into the Web3 world of decentralized applications and non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. When Ethereum debuted almost a decade ago, it expanded the capabilities of what a blockchain could do beyond what Bitcoin pioneered, adding support for smart contracts � essentially software built atop that blockchain.\n\nMetaMask helps users navigate such a smart contract-based environment. Since early last year, similar functionality has been added to Bitcoin, including NFT-like Ordinals and Runes, which enabled the creation of meme coins on Bitcoin. Whether MetaMask support will help users traverse these Bitcoin enhancements is unclear.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Runes Protocol Sees Traction Waning After Much-Hyped Introduction\n\nMetaMask is built by Consensys, an Ethereum-centric research and development firm helmed by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin.

    "title": "Why William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto�s Price\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Recently released emails from former SEC director William Hinman have rallied the XRP troops, but the documents are not a smoking gun.\n\n",
    "content": "On June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)�s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC\u0027s lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case.\n\nHere�s why:\n\nVery broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly.\n\nRipple�s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators.\n\nEarly analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails� release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front.\n\nAhead of the documents� release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn�t a security if it is �sufficiently decentralized.� That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is �sufficiently decentralized� and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman.\n\nCritics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token � and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security.\n\nRipple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called �Ripple� even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders �gifted� 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as �Ripple.�\n\nRead More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency?\n\nTo critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of �decentralization theater.� And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures.\n\nIn any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple\u0027s side of the case, XRP\u0027s price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.\n\nSee Also: Ripple Does Not Care Whether XRP Is �Sufficiently Decentralized�\n\n",

    "content": "Ether (ETH) is expected to experience a period of volatility this week due to exchange inflows spiking to the highest level since March, according to a report by data provider CryptoQuant.\n\nThe daily net flow of ETH, which tracks inflows and outflows to exchanges, hit 62,000 ether ($231 million) this week. High exchange flows are typically associated with volatility, the report said.\n\nThe surge in deposits comes on the back of a significant rally in ether, with prices rising by 22% in two days after Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said that the odds of spot ether exchange traded-fund (ETF) approval have increased to 75% and multiple reports that filing process with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for the ETFs, are suddenly seeing progress.\n\nTraders responded by aggressively opening ETH long positions on perpetual exchanges and buying spot, resulting in the largest daily spot buying from ETH permanent holders so far in 2024. These trades were placed in the hopes that ETH price will see a similar uptick that bitcoin (BTC) has seen since the news of the approval of U.S. spot ETFs started to make the rounds last year.\n\nThe increase in demand for ETH led to a short squeeze, with 9,300 ETH being liquidated on the short side over a 48-hour period.\n\nCryptoQuant warns that if an ether ETF application is delayed or denied, a significant price reaction could occur due to high open interest, which currently stands at a record high of $11.7 billion.\n\nRead more: Ether ETF Hopes Drive Futures Open Interest to Record $14B\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "One of the most powerful women in finance talks to CoinDesk ahead of her Consensus appearance.\n\n",
    "content": "Nadine Chakar is often called one the most powerful women in finance. As global head of the digital asset wing at DTCC, which settles an astronomical amount of transactions annually (in the quadrillions), she has a front row seat to how technology is reinventing finance before our very eyes. Which might be why she�s become such a staunch advocate for blockchain-based innovations. Nadine Chakar is a speaker at this year�s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.\n\n�With tokenization, firms could be more capital-efficient, create new business models and more easily expand product offerings and distribution channels. Firms could unlock new efficiencies and uncover ways to streamline existing processes while finding new markets and ways of unlocking liquidity � and they can likely do it cheaper and faster,� Chakar wrote in a CoinDesk op-ed.\n\nChakar, who has over 30 years of experience of global wealth and asset management experience, has essentially charted her own path through the world of finance. Before DTCC (which acquired her compliance-focused tokenization firm Securrency in 2023), Chakar served as an executive vice president at State Street, where she essentially built out the State Street Digital unit after a stint as executive vice president of the firm�s global markets division.\n\n�This blend of experience between the traditional and the startup worlds has helped me, as a leader, to better understand how to strike the right balance between agile and responsible innovation,� Chakar said in an interview.\n\nSee also: What Consensus Speakers Are Looking Forward to This Year\n\nCoinDesk caught up with Chakar to discuss her career history, how she views digital transformation and what responsible regulation for crypto would look like.\n\nTo what extent did your career at places like State Street Digital and BNY Mellon prepare you to lead the digital asset business at DTCC?\n\nI have a history of working at heavily-regulated financial institutions, which has given me expertise leading teams that can innovate in a responsible, transparent way that meets the highest regulatory standards. However, given my time as CEO of Securrency, I�ve witnessed the power of a fintech that can innovate quickly. This blend of experience between the traditional and the startup worlds has helped me, as a leader, to better understand how to strike the right balance between agile and responsible innovation.\n\nNow that Securrency has become DTCC Digital Assets, I believe we�re leveraging the best of both worlds. We combine DTCC�s legacy of trust and experience as the infrastructure for the world�s largest capital markets with Securrency best-in-class technology capabilities.\n\nAre you observing digital assets impacting traditional financial markets?\n\nI believe digital assets are largely operating in a different universe from traditional markets. However, I think we�re at a turning point where the two are starting to converge. A major challenge is that innovation continues to occur in siloes, where financial institutions will team up with a fintech [company] to launch a pilot, only to culminate with a press release and then fizzle out afterward.\n\nWe�re calling for a change in approach: we should focus on large-scale pilots with many participants and have experiments build upon each other incrementally to begin building a larger, interoperable digital asset ecosystem that can power digital markets.\n\nIt\u0027s often said that market structure for digital assets needs reform: Do you have ideas of what this should look like?\n\nWe require an ecosystem for digital assets that�s worthy of the one we have for traditional assets today. First and foremost, we need infrastructure that can connect traditional systems with the digital ecosystem and that provides the same level of soundness and safety of existing offerings. Second, we must ensure we�re facilitating how assets and processes can move across multiple blockchains.\n\nThird, we must have a clear legal and regulatory framework to establish controls and standards. This is essential, and it should include standards for data, including its use and collection, methods to protect private data and establishing exactly what data is allowed on-chain.\n\nSee also: A Crypto Developer\u0027s Guide to Consensus 2024\n\nOf course, DTCC has been bringing this sort of expertise to the markets for over 50 years. We have the established ecosystem for traditional securities, which will serve as the foundation for creating the digital infrastructure of the future. We are also here to help guide the evolution of the regulatory framework over time to support digital assets.\n\nWe can�t do it alone. This is why we�ve partnered with other financial market infrastructures, Euroclear and Clearstream, to issue a new paper that lays out the path forward for developing this ecosystem in a measured and collaborative way. We�re excited to announce the paper at Consensus.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to at Consensus?\n\nNetworking and connecting with colleagues. It�s worth repeating: the path to creating the digital asset ecosystem starts with collaboration. While there will always be room for firms to compete with their own bright ideas and compelling use cases, we won�t make meaningful progress on tokenization without working together. I�m excited for the industry to collaborate to bring a robust, interoperable digital asset ecosystem to life.\n\n",

    "content": "Approval of a spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. will be seen as significant regulatory relief for the crypto sector and raise expectations for ETH\u0027s rival SOL to be categorized as a commodity, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Tuesday.\n\nThe report sent to clients days before the SEC\u0027s final deadlines on whether to approve some of the ETH ETF applications said the Biden administration might soften its stance on crypto ahead of the November Presidential Elections and a potential Trump victory would be broadly positive.\n\n\"Long term, we do believe, should Trump get elected, crypto could see significant legislative and agency support (with a new SEC chair), to usher in long-lasting structural changes in crypto financial integration,\" analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.\n\n\"More tactically, the Ethereum ETF approval would set the precedent for a first non-Bitcoin blockchain asset to be considered a commodity, raising hopes for Ethereum�s peers (Solana likely) to follow the same path,\" analysts added.\n\nThe classification of cryptocurrencies as either securities or commodities has far-reaching implications. For instance, ETF applications and approval hinge on the classification of tokens as commodities. Meanwhile, categorization as a security means a more stringent regulatory oversight by the SEC.\n\nEther surged higher earlier in the week after two well-followed Bloomberg ETF analysts upped the odds of the SEC approving spot ether ETFS to 75% from 25% and after reports that the regulator had abruptly asked applicants to update their filings, signaling that an approval was more likely. The SEC has several final deadlines on spot ether ETF applications this week after having delayed its decisions a number of times.\n\nBernstein notes that bitcoin rallied 75% since the approval of spot ETFs, and it expects similar price action for ether. Ether\u0027s free float and supply looks more attractive than bitcoin, as 38% of the cryptocurrency is locked in staking, smart contacts and layer 2 chains, and 66% of ETH supply has not moved in the last twelve months, the report noted.\n\nWhile the ether spot ETF 19b-4 filings are likely to be approved this week, S-1 filings are not expected to go effective for weeks to months, \"resulting in no exchange-tradeable ETH spot vehicles until this summer,\" wrote Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital (GLXY) in a report on Tuesday.\n\nIf the SEC approves the spot ETFs, Galaxy speculates that they could launch on exchanges in July or August. Galaxy also expects the regulator to approve all the applications simultaneously to avoid giving any individual issuer a head start.\n\nRead more: Ethereum ETF Approval Could Spur 60% Rally as ETH Buying Increases\n\n",

Weekly fees have crossed $1.3 million for the first time since November, making the platform over $600,000 in revenue.\n\nBuilt on Base, a layer-2 network, Friend.Tech lets crypto personalities on X issue �shares� for access to a closed group chat. For users, the allure of these chats is that their owners could offer trading insights, token picks or access to seed-funding deals � which raises the value of the shares.\n\nThe bump in activity precedes the coming of version 2 of the application, which developers said will be released after April 20. A key element of the update is expanding the platform beyond X to attract newer users.\n\nOver the weekend, developers also teased a FRIEND token. Expectations among users are that these could be distributed based on how many points � a reward for Friend.Tech usage � they accumulate before the token release.\n\nFriend.tech was earning in excess of $1 million per day in fees at its August peak after going viral on X and gaining more than 100,000 unique users, a significant number for crypto application standards. Shares of some crypto X personalities, such as @Cobie and @HsakaTrades, jumped to as much as three ether, or nearly $5,000, at the time.\n\nActivity fell off in the months following as the initial allure wore off.

    "summary": "The House\u0027s passage of the digital assets legislation passes the crypto baton to the Senate, where odds remain low for decisive action.\n\n",
    "content": "The crypto industry recorded its biggest-ever U.S. policy win on Wednesday when the House of Representatives approved a wide-reaching bill to establish regulations for digital assets markets, recording a 279-136 vote that saw Democrats crossing party lines to support it.\n\nThe Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) marks the first time a major crypto bill has cleared one of the chambers of Congress. The issue now heads to the U.S. Senate, where its future is much murkier, because there\u0027s no counterpart bill. Support for such an effort remains unclear there, and the necessary committees haven\u0027t done the same level of work on crypto.\n\nThe U.S. has fallen behind other global jurisdictions in establishing crypto regulations, and despite the win on Wednesday, implementing such oversight is far from complete.\n\n\"We need rules of the road,\" said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), one of the Democrats who bucked the opposition of the White House and the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). He called it \"well-reasoned, thoughtful, bipartisan legislation\" and argued before the vote that \"it\u0027s fit to become law if we work together.\"\n\nOverall, 71 Democrats and 208 Republicans voted in favor of the bill, versus 3 Republicans and 133 Democrats who voted against.\n\nPresident Joe Biden opposed the bill with a policy statement, though he didn\u0027t say he\u0027d veto the bill, as he had recently when Congress sought to overturn a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) effort to set crypto accounting policy. SEC Chair Gary Gensler also came out strongly against the legislation in a lengthy public statement arguing the bill wasn\u0027t needed and endangered existing securities regulations.\n\nThe legislation � largely driven by House Republicans � would establish a regime to regulate the U.S. crypto markets, setting consumer protections, installing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a leading regulator of digital assets and the watchdog of the non-securities spot markets and it would more clearly define what makes a crypto token a security or a commodity.\n\nWaters argued that the bill is seeking to let the crypto businesses who have been dodging securities laws avoid responsibility.\n\n\"They have already made billions of dollars unlawfully issuing or facilitating the buying and selling of crypto securities,\" Waters said. \"And Republicans are now proposing to reward these illegal activities by making these activities legal.\"\n\nPrior to Wednesday afternoon\u0027s vote, the House debated a handful of amendments to the bill, including by Reps. Greg Casar (D-Texas), Brittany Pettersen (D-Co.), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) and Scott Perry (R-Pa.). Casar\u0027s amendment to change a crowdfunding exemption from $75 million to $5 million was defeated, but the rest were adopted.\n\nRead More: Crypto Industry Rallies Behind House Bill as It Heads Toward Final Vote\n\nUPDATE (May 22, 2024, 21:48 UTC): Adds vote count, removes CBDC bill mention.\n\n",

    "content": "This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk�s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) consolidated recent gains early this morning ahead of the SEC\u0027s decision on VanEck\u0027s spot ETH ETF application later today. BTC is little changed, down about 0.8% in the last 24 hours at $69,600, while ETH has risen nearly 2.75% to over $3,800. The wider digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) is down just over 0.5%. The general outlook for the two largest cryptocurrencies remains bullish. BTC and ETH options on derivatives exchange Deribit continue to reveal a bias for calls, or contracts that allow traders to profit from price rises, according to data tracked by Amberdata.\n\nBlackRock, Grayscale, and Bitwise filed amended 19b-4 forms with the SEC for their proposed spot ether ETFs, removing the staking provisions some commentators said were causing regulatory roadblocks. Staking is the process of locking specific cryptocurrencies for a set period to help support the operation of a blockchain for a reward. These rewards are considered mainly passive income among crypto traders. All ether ETF hopefuls have now filed their amended proposals ahead of an approval or disapproval decision expected today. Fidelity filed earlier this week, with VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Invesco Galaxy and ARK 21Shares following suit. Hashdex is the only issuer yet to file an amendment to its Ethereum ETF.\n\nShares in Nvidia reached a record high during Wednesday\u0027s post-market hours after the company beat analyst estimates to report record revenue of $26.04 billion for the first quarter. The rally might be a positive signal for cryptocurrencies, including tokens supposedly associated with AI technology. This is because, historically, the inflow of money into the crypto market and the so-called AI coins has been partly contingent on outsized gains in NVDA and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index. Top AI coins such as FET, ICP, RNDR and GRT traded mixed, having rallied in the lead-up to the NVDA announcement, according to data by CoinGecko.\n\n- Omkar Godbole\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "More people are calling for crypto companies and those behind products such as stablecoins to prove they have enough funds to pay their customers.\n\n",
    "content": "Regular banks do not actually hold all of your money. They lend out most of your deposits in an attempt to eke out returns from financial markets. This works, for the most part, because the bank insures deposits with the federal government and because the bank widely diversifies its exposure to risk to ensure that it won�t be caught short in the event of a financial crash.\n\nThis system occasionally fails in traditional finance (see: Lehman) but fails frequently in crypto. The government does not insure deposits to crypto platforms and the platforms often do not manage risk particularly well (see: FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network), making high-risk bets that end in catastrophe.\n\nRead More: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?\n\nAfter so many platforms squandered customer funds, crypto traders are thinking twice about depositing funds to crypto exchanges and lending institutions that �rehypothecate� uninsured deposits � which means they repurpose customer money and lend the funds out in the markets. A safer bet looks like trading on platforms that �fully back� their reserves. But what does this really mean, and should such claims be taken with a pinch of salt?\n\nWhen a financial product, such as a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to �fully back� its reserves, it means that it has stored enough money behind a product, like a stablecoin or a customer�s trading account, to support its worth.\n\nSo, a crypto exchange that �fully backs� its reserves should always be able to pay out customer withdrawals, no matter the state of the market. One such example is Coinbase, which does not lend out its customers� funds without their express permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to prevent a bank run.\n\nA stablecoin that �fully backs� its reserves is always able to fulfill conversions to the original asset, no matter what. One example is wBTC, or wrapped bitcoin, which holds real bitcoin (BTC) in a cold wallet, then issues an equal amount of an Ethereum-based version of the coin that trades as an ERC-20 token.\n\nFully backed, however, does not necessarily mean that assets are held one to one. That claim refers to the idea that if you, say, give me a dollar, I�ll hold that dollar as a dollar and won�t turn it into something else. Lots of stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like U.S.-dollar stablecoin USDC, are not backed one to one.\n\nThis is because the companies that issue USDC hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in �cash and cash equivalents.� Cash equivalents refer to U.S. Treasury bonds, which is debt issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. These bonds, which pay small returns to holders over time, are close enough to the worth of actual U.S. dollars that the market accepts bonds being essentially worth the same.\n\nBut �fully backed� does not always mean that the backing can withstand financial shocks. U.S. dollar stablecoin tether (USDT) also claims that its reserves are fully backed, but this backing is secured by �other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether [the issuing company] to third parties.� So, USDT may be fully backed, but it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies.\n\nUntil October 2022, USDT was also backed by commercial paper � short-term commercial debt to other companies � and moved those funds to U.S. Treasurys. The concern about the commercial paper was that nobody knew which companies Tether was using to back USDT, so it was impossible to determine the worth of that backing. What�s more, its �fully backed� claim has historically turned out not to be true after it emerged in 2019 that USDT was, at one point, only 74% backed. As wrote the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u0027s Dawn D. Stump, the claim that it was backed to the U.S. dollar was �not 100% true, 100% of the time.�\n\nRead more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its Value\n\nSome stablecoins do not fully back their reserves, which has led to catastrophic results in some cases. The popular algorithmic stablecoin UST, for instance, crashed in spectacular fashion, wiping billions from the market.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, meaning it has more than enough crypto on hand to back its coin.

    "summary": "How to earn, store and spend our blockchain-powered answer to loyalty points.\n\n",
    "content": "At CoinDesk, we�re not just chronicling the business model transformation that digital assets and the blockchain have made possible � we�re actively participating in it.\n\nAt Consensus 2021, a virtual event, we beta-tested DESK, an experiment in using tokenized rewards to incentivize engagement and community-building, garnering positive feedback from our audience. At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019.\n\nIn December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com.\n\nRead More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk�s Website Offers Tokenized Reader Experience\n\nBelow is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information.\n\nDESK is CoinDesk�s social token.\n\nDESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content.\n\nDESK�s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together.\n\nAs of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include:\n\nAt Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as:\n\nDESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum.\n\nPolygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction.\n\nYou�ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners.\n\nRead more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your Wallet\n\nYes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account.\n\nIn the Web2 era, content creators � be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers � have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines).\n\nWe�re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms.\n\nWe believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal.\n\nWe hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event.\n\nSocial tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants.\n\nInitially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward.\n\nSimply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience.\n\nNo. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone�s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity.\n\nIt is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading.\n\nBy providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We\u0027ve seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization.\n\nNo. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users.\n\nNo. See above.\n\nNo. We\u0027re not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement.\n\nListing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use.\n\nIt�s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests.\n\nSo, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether.\n\nPart of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground.\n\nNo. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless.\n\nCoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon.\n\nBecause DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK\u0027s beta testers.\n\nPiranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept.\n\nAt Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk�s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike.\n\nCoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others.\n\nAs mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used.\n\nNavigate to the DESK dashboard. Select \"Create or Connect Wallet\" and approve the transaction in your wallet.\n\nDepends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com. We will not use this data for anything other than authenticating users when they sign on or distributing DESK rewards, we will never sell it, and we will protect user information assiduously. (See our privacy policy.) DESK transactions will appear on DESK\u0027s page on the Polyscan block explorer, but only the wallet addresses will be displayed.\n\nDESK has no inherent monetary value, but, whether or not you live in a jurisdiction where utility tokens are deemed taxable, you should consult a tax professional if you have concerns.\n\nWe�ll keep a record of airdrops, product developments and other updates critical to DESK�s roadmap and tokenomics in our DESK product blog.\n\nYou can also keep abreast of DESK updates in our Discord server.\n\nThe latest release is only the beginning in developing our Web3 model for DESK on coindesk.com. We\u0027ll be working on improving our wallet functionality, currently in beta, and looking forward to seeing what data and reader feedback reveal as to how to continue improving the experience\n\n",

    "summary": "Some traders expect ether prices to reach as high as $4,000 in the coming days, with odds of an ether ETF approval raised to 75%.\n\n",
    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) surged over $71,000 early Tuesday, its highest since early April, as ether surged over 19% to $3,700 after Bloomberg analysts raised the probability that spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) gets approved in the U.S. to 75%.\n\nOther majors chalked out relatively smaller gains, with XRP, Cardano\u0027s ADA, Solana\u0027s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) rising between 3-6%, as per CoinGecko data.\n\nThe sudden move up caused over $260 million in market-wide short liquidations, the biggest since Feb.28. Ether shorts lost over $115 million, followed by bitcoin shorts at just over $99 million, Coinglass data shows.\n\nCrypto exchange Binance logged over $130 million in liquidations, the largest among counterparts, followed by OKX at $118 million and Huobi at $51 million.\n\nShorts are bets against higher price movements. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader\u0027s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader\u0027s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).\n\nMarkets started to rally late Monday as Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised the odds of a spot ether ETF to 75% from the early 20%. Later, CoinDesk reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked aspiring ether exchange-traded fund exchanges to update 19b-4 filings ahead of a key deadline this week.\n\nMarket participants consider the approval of an ether ETF to be a bullish event, opening the floodgates to institutional capital. The spot bitcoin ETF, which started trading in January, has racked up $12 billion in total inflows for BTC, with top trading firms and state funds among its holders.\n\nMeanwhile, some traders expect ether prices to rise further in the coming days.\n\n�Our view is that it is unlikely that spot can settle here, with approval taking us closer to 4k and denial back to 3k,� Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast. �Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis, suggesting approval is imminent.�\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The benefits of transparency, security, and e?ciency could be useful in dozens of industries when sourcing and managing supply chains, says Julie Lamb, Head of Events at Crypto Mondays.\n\n",
    "content": "Have you ever wondered about the true potential of blockchain technology beyond its association with ?nance? Blockchain offers transparency, security, and e?ciency, revolutionizing processes and unlocking new opportunities for businesses worldwide. Hence, the expected growth trajectories in the coming years. Below we look at how these benefits can provide advantages to companies adopting blockchain tech beyond pure financial applications.\n\nYou\u0027re reading Crypto Long \u0026 Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nTransparency: There�s a common misconception that blockchain technology lacks transparency. In reality, it is inherently transparent, thanks to a decentralized ledger system. Each transaction is recorded on a public ledger, enabling quick and easy identi?cation of affected products. This transparency enhances accountability and trust in supply chains, ensuring consumer safety and product integrity.\n\nSimplicity: While blockchain technology may seem complex at ?rst glance, businesses can bene?t from simpli?ed explanations and practical applications. By focusing on real-world case studies and actionable insights, organizations that are using data science like GE, IBM, PayPal, AWS, Uber, John Deere, NASA and others have grasped data-driven insights across various sectors and its potential to streamline operations, enhance security, and drive innovation.\n\nGlobal Adoption: Blockchain is revolutionizing industry applications ranging from supply chain management and healthcare to voting systems and digital identity veri?cation. For example, AWS introduced Track and Trace with Amazon Managed Blockchain, a fully-managed service that automatically scales to meet the demands of thousands of applications running millions of transactions. Added benefits to leveraging supply chains with blockchain include scalability, cost reduction, transparency and ease of process automation.\n\nSustainability: Some major companies are leveraging blockchains for sustainability and fair treatment of workers purposes. In recent news, Mondele?z International, the parent to brands like Oreo, Ritz, Clif Bar, Cadbury, and Toblerone, announced that it�s joining the Hedera Council, the entity that governs the Hedera Network, �a sustainable public ledger for the decentralized economy.� By tapping Web3 tech, the Council expects Mondele?z to increase business efficiency and sustainability and innovate across customer engagement.\n\nConclusion: It\u0027s not too late to explore the vast opportunities in the blockchain space. As the industry continues to evolve and mature, early adopters stand to bene?t from investment opportunities, technological advancements, and market growth. Blockchain tech holds immense potential beyond ?nance, offering transparency, security, and e?ciency across various industries. By dispelling myths, embracing opportunities, and staying informed, businesses can harness the power of blockchain to drive innovation, foster trust, and achieve sustainable growth.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\n",

    "content": "Approval of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the U.S. could drive a rally of as much as 60% in the second-largest cryptocurrency in the coming months, QCP Capital said in a Thursday broadcast on Telegram\n\nThe forecast echoes the market reaction after spot bitcoin ETFs were approved in January, the Singapore-based firm said. Bitcoin rose to over $73,000 from $42,000 in the two weeks after the ETFs started trading on Jan. 11, CoinGecko data shows.\n\nLatest News: Bitcoin Drops Below $68K, Ether Slumps in Sudden Crypto Sell-Off as ETH ETF Decision Looms\n\n\"With Friday implied volatility above 100%, the market is expecting fireworks,\" QCP said. \"VanEck�s ETF has been listed by the DTCC. We think approval is now highly likely with trading expected as early as next week.�\n\nImplied volatility measures the market\u0027s expectation of future price fluctuations for a financial instrument.\n\nBuying activity increased on both centralized and blockchain-based crypto exchanges, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant said in a Wednesday report. Holders bought over 100,000 ETH in spot markets on Tuesday, the highest daily level since September 2023, as reports of a favorable decision emerged and some analysts bumped odds to over 75% from the earlier 25%.\n\nOpen interest on ether-tracked futures spiked in tandem to a record $14 billion. That\u0027s 67% of bitcoin open interest as of Wednesday, an unusually high level.\n\nActivity also increased at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, an exchange favored by institutions, with ether futures hitting a record notional $2.85 billion of trading on Tuesday, according to a spokesperson. Ether options traded a record 1,135 contracts ($216 million).\n\n�Traders seem to be getting more exposure now to ETH relative to Bitcoin,� CryptoQuant said. \"The largest daily spot buying from ETH permanent holders so far in 2024.\"\n\nEther prices in the coming days could be volatile after investors sent 62,000 ETH to exchanges, the most since early March, it said. \"High exchange flows are typically associated with price volatility.�\n\nOn the flip side, the firm�s analysts warned of a �significant price correction� should the ETF application be dismissed.\n\nSix issuers, including BlackRock, filed updated copies of their ether ETF proposals this week ahead of a decision due today. All removed plans to stake the token, which suggests the activity may have been a regulatory roadblock.\n\nStaking is the process of locking a cryptocurrency for a set period of time to help support the operation of a blockchain, in turn for a reward. These rewards are largely considered passive income among crypto traders.\n\nAs of Thursday, annualized yields on ether staking were nearly 3%, according to data from popular staking service Lido.\n\nOliver Knight contributed reporting to this story.\n\nUpdate (May 23, 09:53 UTC): Adds CME futures, options trading in seventh paragraph.\n\n\n\n",

Click here to sign up for future editions.\n\nConsensus, CoinDesk\u0027s annual conference, kicks off next Wednesday in Austin, Texas. We\u0027ll have a number of policymakers and industry participants engaging in the policy world. We have a few sessions on Wednesday, May 29, and Friday, May 31, but the bulk of this will take place on Thursday, May 30, when we hold our annual Policy Summit.\n\nThe policy summit is focused on, well, policy issues. And they\u0027re important. On Tuesday alone, we saw an intense discussion about a pending House vote on possibly the first crypto market structure bill to make it through one of Congress\u0027 legislative bodies, the possibility that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission might approve spot ether exchange-traded funds, and Uniswap Labs\u0027 response to a Wells Notice sent to it by the SEC.\n\nClearly, there\u0027s a lot going on. My goal is to see what we can learn from our panels of speakers next week.\n\nCoinDesk is holding its annual Policy Summit stage at Consensus 2024 next week in Austin, Texas (still need a ticket? Coupon code below!).\n\nDuring the policy summit, we\u0027ll hear from SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce and CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger, Sen. Bill Hagerty and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, representatives from the IRS and Senate candidates.\n\nThe agenda includes issues such as the upcoming U.S. election, current policy within key regulatory agencies, the European Union\u0027s Markets in Crypto Assets framework, taxes, and more. The crypto industry has discussed or tried to lobby on each of these issues over the past few years, and we\u0027ll see more engagement on them in the coming days.\n\nWe\u0027re kicking the summit off with Commissioners Peirce and Mersinger. I\u0027ll moderate this opening session with the commissioners before we turn things over to my colleague Camomile for a session on MiCA and its implementation later this year. Jesse Hamilton and Cheyenne Ligon are also set to moderate important discussions through the course of the day.\n\nOutside of the main policy summit, we\u0027re also going to hear from senior policy officials, like Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee. We\u0027ll talk about issues like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\u0027s proposed rulemaking designating mixers as primary money laundering concerns, and a panel focused on mixers and privacy will delve into both ongoing legal cases against developers and the broader issue of balancing the right to transact privately with the very real concern that illicit actors � like certain rogue nations � might be taking advantage of privacy tools for malign ends.\n\nWe\u0027ll talk about the role corporate monitors might play in crypto moving forward, after Binance\u0027s landmark settlement with U.S. officials that will see it reporting to a monitor for the next few years.\n\nPanelists will look at how central bank digital currencies are actually being developed and used in countries around the world, separating hypothetical concerns from practical realities.\n\nRepresentatives from the IRS will walk through what they\u0027re doing now to further develop the tax agency\u0027s approach to digital assets, and another speaker will discuss the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u0027s global crypto tax reporting framework.\n\nCrypto broker Prometheum will take us over its soft launch of a custody service, what that means for the industry and where it\u0027s going next.\n\nSenate candidates Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) and John Deaton (R-Mass.) will take the stage, as will presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. And we\u0027ll hear from many more policy � and other � speakers over the course of the event.\n\nI\u0027m moderating conversations with Senators Wyden and Hagerty, Commissioners Peirce and Mersinger and Under Secretary Nelson. If you have a question you think may be interesting, feel free to respond to this email and send those my way. I might ask the best ones on stage.\n\nTuesday\n\nWednesday\n\nThursday\n\nIf you�ve got thoughts or questions on what I should discuss next week or any other feedback you�d like to share, feel free to email me at nik@coindesk.com or find me on Twitter @nikhileshde.\n\nYou can also join the group conversation on Telegram.\n\nSee ya�ll next week!\n\n",

On-chain analysis by Lookonchain shows a crypto address that purchased about $460 worth of the tokens shortly after launch bagged over $3.4 million in profits this week.\n\nThe buyer spent 0.22 ETH to buy 324.9B PEPE on April 15, 2023, and deposited the tokens to crypto exchange Binance on Wednesday, Lookonchain said, where the tokens were presumably sold.\n\nIt is unknown if the address was connected to the developer team that issued PEPE. However, the usage of automated bots is common among meme coin traders � who typically purchase small amounts of every token that hits the market, based on certain criteria, hoping to eventually catch a big win.\n\nSome traders expect PEPE to eventually flip the dog-themed shiba inu (SHIB), which is valued at a $14 billion market capitalization as of Thursday.\n\nPepe�s early buys have minted several millionaires in the past year. A few connected wallets turned about $1,200 of initial capital to over $9 million in the week after the token�s launch, as reported, while another $260 purchase netted over $3 million in profits for a different buyer.\n\n",

It surged 14% on Tuesday as the Trump campaign said it would begin to accept crypto donations, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and meme coins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB).\n\nFrom all this, some holders of the MAGA meme coin � the first experiment in a new category of tokens called PoliFi, which has a collective market cap of $749 million � have seen returns of over 1,600%.\n\nOne such address is sitting on over $5.5 million worth of the token.\n\nSeveral addresses purchased low six-figures in TRUMP tokens and are now sitting on unrealized gains of over $1 million. They are gradually trimming their holdings but not selling in a manner that could cause a sudden price dump. As such, these sales were made before Tuesday�s campaign donation announcement.\n\nHowever, recent buyers of the TRUMP token are posting a poor return on investment and have a low overall win rate, the data showed.\n\nMeanwhile, the value of TRUMP holdings sent to a wallet linked to the actual Donald Trump has risen to nearly $5 million.\n\nA wallet supposedly linked to Trump received $7,100 of TRUMP from the meme coin�s developers between August and October 2023.\n\nSending tokens to a wallet linked to popular entities is sometimes used as a marketing strategy by meme coin makers, as they can attract eyeballs � and galvanize investor interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Here are some ways users and developers, the lifeblood of crypto, can help move better legislation through Congress, writes Rebecca Rettig, Chief Legal \u0026 Policy Officer at Polygon Labs.\n\n",
    "content": "If you told me when I got into the blockchain space more than seven years ago that key pieces of sweeping market structure legislation for crypto would be brought to the floor of the House of Representatives, I wouldn�t have believed it.\n\nBack then, crypto was a nascent technology viewed as �niche� or �off the beaten path.� As a lawyer in private practice advising software developers building innovative, cutting edge technology, I worked exclusively behind the scenes on novel legal questions for this emerging sector.\n\nRebecca Rettig is a speaker at this year\u0027s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.\n\nWe�re in a different world now. The concept of blockchain has greater cultural relevance than ever before, driven forward by evangelists and developers building on the margins.\n\nAdvocates see blockchain-based technology as transformative, with the ability to redefine not only how we engage in financial transactions, but also all internet-based interactions. Crypto brings the possibility of a new, decentralized internet to center stage in many ways, and global policymakers and regulators have trained their attention on what to do with this new industry like never before.\n\nPolicymakers and regulators are grappling with definitional and threshold questions of whether and how to regulate. What does it mean for a software system to be decentralized? When do potential financial risks emanate from cyber-security threats, and how do we mitigate such risks? What is necessary to ensure the overall integrity of the system?\n\nA huge shift is underway in helping educate lawmakers on how to answer these questions. The policy arm of the industry has focused and professionalized as rapidly as the technology has developed. This may make advocacy seem esoteric and removed for those who are actually building and using the technology. But the time for builders and users to get involved in educating and working with lawmakers is now. This is more true than ever after the passage of the first market structure bill for crypto passed the House yesterday with a bipartisan vote.\n\nAs builders in this space, you have unique knowledge and insights in how this technology works and why it is an unprecedented reorientation of what the internet can look like. Grassroots efforts play an essential role in advocating for crypto and I have heard time and again from members of Congress that you�re exactly who they want to hear from. The point of advocacy is to help regulators tap knowledge workers and enthusiasts who have the information that can help craft polity.\n\nSo how can you get started? There are a couple easy ways to engage.\n\nA number of organizations have been established specifically to give you the tools you need to advocate most effectively. Example? Crypto Policy Bootcamp.\n\nIn October 2023, Polygon Labs, Solana Foundation and DeFi Education Fund co-hosted the first Crypto Policy Bootcamp. The event brought together founders, CEOs, VCs, and other stakeholders to engage with policy experts, political advocates, and Congressional staffers and members of Congress. Discussions centered on how to talk about the value of blockchain technology. Through the various panels and accompanying dialogue, the bootcamp produced many takeaways, including:\n\nSince October, we�ve hosted four additional bootcamps alongside others in the industry including Wormhole Foundation and Ledger, with the fifth coming at the end of May at Consensus. And the stage is set for one of the strongest crypto advocates in Congress, Tom Emmer, to take time out to speak to Bootcamp attendees in Austin.\n\nThese bootcamps aim to make policy work accessible to anyone by equipping those building, investing, or working in the space with the tools and resources they need to effectively advocate for the evolution of the blockchain industry, ecosystem, and community on the Hill and beyond. And it is one of many fantastic ways to get the tools to get involved; there are organizations, such as Stand With Crypto, that are dedicated to this task, bringing builders together in D.C. and beyond to advocate.\n\nSpeaking directly to policymakers, especially your own Congressional representatives, has an unquestionably high impact.\n\nEven better when you can also tell your story. This can take many different forms: calling, writing letters, setting up meetings.\n\nThere are also a number of tools that aggregate stories and help educate lawmakers, which you can use to provide your own compelling testimony. Along with the community, Ihelped launch an open, interactive website, The Value Prop (TVP), which aggregates blockchain-based applications into a simple database. It showcases everything from community-built GPS and hotspot networks to tracking supply chains to online verification of digital records and information.\n\nThe effort took place over many months, with the enthusiastic community members submitting hundreds of use cases. As a result, TVP has become a mainstay of grassroots clarity for decision makers: policymakers and regulators use it as a resource.\n\nContributors from the crypto community like the Ethereum Foundation, Celo Foundation, and Mercy Corps Ventures, have elevated the site further. Now it features video testimonials of builders and founders discussing what they�re creating, why they�re doing it, and the impact of their work.\n\nWhat The Value Prop needs now more than ever are user testimonials. These testimonials bring to life the people actually using crypto, and the positive impact it�s made on their lives.\n\nTo that end, core team members of Polygon Labs will want to hear what you have to say! At Consensus on May 30, we�ll be interviewing users who want to testify about how they use this tech, why, and what it�s made of their life.\n\nYou � the builders and the users � are the lifeblood of the industry. You�re the most important voices that can be heard on policy issues.\n\nStart engaging.\n\nIt doesn�t have to be with trips to DC or even to your representatives office in your home state. You can engage from the busy Austin streets during Consensus, by filming a user testimony. Or any other myriad ways.\n\nYour time is now.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "There are a few things that make Jack Dorsey�s vision for Web5 distinct, including not wanting to completely replace Web2 but work with it.\n\n",
    "content": "The world is still getting its collective head around Web3 � a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls \"Web5\"?\n\nIt turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey�s payments company, Block (n�e Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises �an extra decentralized web platform.�\n\nTo land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 \u003d 5.\n\nWeb5�s core idea is to �put you in control of your data and identity� � a core tenet of Web3�s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet�s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS.\n\nDorsey�s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data �captive in app silos,� Web5 pushes for �a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.�\n\nThere are three pillars at Web5�s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017.\n\nSo, what�s new here � apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey�s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any �special utility tokens or subjective consensus� that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service.\n\nIn doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin�s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5�s nascent community already balked at TBD�s attempt to trademark the term Web5.\n\nThe other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5�s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user�s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform.\n\nTBD�s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to �help her visualize her itinerary.� Again, the idea is to tie data that�s usually locked inside centralized services � something TBD calls �a massive, unworkable mess� � to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user�s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes.\n\nWill it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that�s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS).\n\nOne of the key things that distinguish TBD�s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it�s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5�s announcement: �Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It�s like a high school student saying �yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it�s meant to be.� It�s naive.�\n\n",

    "summary": "A year ago, �Crypto+AI� sounded like a game of �VC mad libs.� Now, as real-world applications begin to emerge, the idea makes much more sense. Jeff Wilser, who is hosting the AI Summit at Consensus 2024, offers a preview of the programming and reviews the decentralized AI state-of-play.\n\n",
    "content": "Almost exactly one year ago, I wrote a piece for CoinDesk called 10 Ways Crypto and AI Can Make Each Other Better (or Maybe Worse). At the time, the idea of �Crypto + AI� was still a novel concept. Even fringe. To many, AI development felt adjacent � at best � to the world of Web3. To others, �Crypto + AI� felt like a cynical mix of two hype-y trends, like VC mad libs.\n\nFlash forward one year.\n\nDecentralized AI is arguably the hottest topic in the web3 space. Dozens of projects � maybe hundreds, it�s hard to keep track � are now racing to merge the tools of blockchain with the taming of AI. The space is booming. By the time you finish reading this article, another DePIN startup will have launched. And the architects of this movement are converging in Austin, for Consensus 2024, in CoinDesk�s inaugural �AI Summit.� (I�ll cop to some bias: I helped organize the event and I�ll be hosting on May 31.)\n\nSo why is this happening, and why does it matter?\n\nYou could argue that the stakes of decentralized AI are higher than the stakes of decentralized finance. In some ways the principles are the same. Satoshi Nakamoto was wary of centralized financial institutions that acted badly and jeopardized people�s money. As AI becomes a greater part of our lives � and that feels inevitable � it will have the power to shape how we see the world, how we interact with the world, and how we present to the world. It could shape how we think. Should this be controlled by the billionaire de jour?\n\nLet�s look at two concrete examples, one that�s straightforward and one that�s chilling. The next frontier of Gen AI is likely the rise of AI agents, which can do things like book your flight, pay your phone bill, or invest your money in stocks. (�Hey Siri, go ahead and put $1,000 in the S\u0026P.�)\n\nDo we want Big Tech to control not just our data, but also what we do with it?\n\nMore chilling: It�s likely that millions of people will someday use AI chatbots � perhaps through audio or even video � as coaches or even therapists. Early versions are here now. (On my podcast AI-Curious, for example, I interviewed a longtime coach who�s working with the German Research Center to develop AI-based personal coaching. It�s coming. It�s inevitable.) Millions of people will share their inner-most thoughts, longings, fears, sexual desires, confessions and embarrassments. Do we want this sliced and diced by Zuckerberg and co.? The decentralized and privacy-preserving tech of blockchain, potentially, could give us the fruits of AI without the poison of Big Tech.\n\nThese are the stakes of decentralized AI. These are the topics covered at the AI Summit. (Or some of the topics. Others include how blockchain can help us preserve truth in an era of deepfakes, fight censorship, make �AI compute� more inclusive, fight bias, lead to AI alignment, and on and on.)\n\nWhile an explosion of AI + Crypto projects have launched since 2022, some have been around for years and have been quietly building. One is Singularity NET, founded in 2017 by Ben Goertzel, a prominent AI researcher, with an early vision of building decentralized AI. �My initial vision for what became SingularityNET occurred to me in �95 or �96, when the internet became a thing,� Goertzel told me recently in Panama City, at an AI conference hosted by Singularity. �It seemed to me, the internet shouldn�t be centralized. The internet is a decentralized network. So why would you want to have a centralized search service?� The seeds of this idea included AI (which he has studied since the 80s), and Goertzel has the receipts: A 2001 book �Creating Internet Intelligence� that fuses all these concepts.\n\nGoertzel will share his thoughts on how to actually pull off this vision at the AI Summit, along with other pioneers trying to hammer out the plumbing, pipes, and protocols of decentralized AI. That brings us to DePIN (or decentralized physical infrastructure networks), where communities of token-holders are incentivized to participate in building online services.\n\nGensyn, for example, is building a decentralized network that will let the untapped computing power from individual users (like you and me) be harnessed for the training of AI data, a la Filecoin for cloud storage. �We�re kind of running out of places to build enormous data centers,� Gensyn�s co-founder Ben Fielding told me last year, before this became a trendy topic. If Gensyn pulls this off, says Fielding, �You don�t just have one big data center. Now you have every data center on the planet.� (Fielding will also be taking the stage at the AI Summit, along with the heads of DePIN projects IoTeX and Grass.)\n\nWhile many of the Web3+AI projects are infrastructure plays, there are now attempts to build decentralized GenAI models that compete directly with the OpenAIs of the world. And that gets us to another example of the crypto-meets-AI space, Erik Voorhees, a bitcoin OG who has vocally supported Morpheus (decentralized and open-sourced AI) and recently announced the launch of VeniceAI.\n\nIn a Twitter/X thread, Voorhees argued that Venice is similar to centralized chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude and even Grok, but �without all the Orwellian stuff� and that �Venice doesn�t spy on you,� �Venice doesn�t censor your conversation,� and �Venice doesn�t inject bias, safetyism, or political propaganda.� Only 10 days later he showed it in action and said, �There are no ads in Venice.ai and you get basically the same answer as MSFTCopilot.� Shots fired.\n\nVoorhees and Venice are just some of the players in this space. There are countless more. Every day there�s a new launch or new partnerships. Just in the last few days, for example, Eternal AI announced a partnership with Filecoin, as a Twitter/X post explained that �Filecoin will provide decentralized storage for AI models, while Eternal AI, with its network of AI agents, will provide decentralized inference.�\n\nOne reason these projects are all suddenly so prevalent? To be cynical for a moment, sure, there�s heat in the space and VCs like heat. (The return of a crypto bull market doesn�t hurt.) But another reason is that, in a sense, there are no other options. There aren�t many centralized AI players. The costs are staggering so only a handful can play at the table.\n\n�The power concentration [of AI] is getting worse, not better,� says Nathaniel Whittemore, aka NLW, host of the AI Daily Brief and founder of BeSuperAI, who�s hosting an AI Town Hall at Consensus. �And greater concentration leads to more of a feeling of a need for decentralized approaches.�\n\nNone of this will happen overnight. In some ways, it�s all still a longshot. We need the smartest people in the space to collaborate, argue, and swap ideas and inspiration. We need an AI Summit.\n\n",

    "content": "Through each stepchange in technology, marketing has continually evolved. What started in the early days of Mesopotamia and Egypt, with merchants advertising their goods using symbols and signs on stalls, has become a complex global industry, constantly adapting to communications innovation.\n\nThis op-ed is part of CoinDesk\u0027s Web3 Marketing Week.\n\nWhen it comes to Web3, the latest innovation, Jeff Kauffman knows his stuff. Starting out early in the days of Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, Kauffman built brand communities for clients like GameStop, Dr. Pepper and Chick-fil-A. He later founded JUMP, a network for branding executives curious about Web 3, which has drawn brand managers from at least 200 Fortune 500 companies.\n\n�With Web3, you now have this on-chain touchpoint relationship and experience and that�s the biggest difference, that there is this on-chain element to the end-user customer experience.� Kauffman, a speaker at this year�s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, believes the future direction of marketing lies in Web 3.0 social platforms, like Farcaster and portable social graphs, which offer unique experiences and put more control back into users\u0027 hands.\n\n�Take a look at what happened with the Starbucks loyalty program,� Jeff said. �While I commend the brand and the team for the effort, ultimately, they decided to shut it down. What did they get wrong? They tried to copy/paste their Web2 program and do it in a Web3 way. They tried to make it Web3, but it just didn\u0027t work.\n\n�Web2 is the best way to run that loyalty program. If you\u0027re going to enter Web3 and use tokens and start to interact with customers on-chain, whether it\u0027s under the umbrella of loyalty or not, you must think about a net-new experience with your customers.�\"\n\nIn a recent interview, Kauffman covered how marketing is changing with Web3, where it might go next, some examples of brands pushing the envelope and what makes for good marketing strategies with brands and creators.\n\nThe following has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nCan you give me some examples of brands utilizing this offline to online to on-chain framework and pushing the envelope?\n\nKauffman: Two brands that are doing well are Coinbase and 9dcc, a fashion brand started by G-Money. 9dcc is a good example of a brand that truly understands this offline, online, and on-chain brand experience and customer experience. But I\u0027ll start with Coinbase. They\u0027ve done this cool thing as a publicly traded company where they\u0027ve released their earnings report as an NFT collectible for free. Anyone can mint it, and then those who did receive discounts to their merch store, and get exclusive perks, for example, access to limited edition hats that are only available to people who minted their earnings report. This shows the connection between offline, online, and on-chain. The offline component is the merchandise (the physical goods), the online component is the shopping experience of buying or securing the goods, and the on-chain element is minting their earnings report on-chain. And with the on-chain element, what\u0027s key is that brands are putting their story on-chain.\n\nWhat enabled this?\n\nKauffman: When Web3 became a term in 2020-2021, it was kind of all about, \"Hey, we\u0027ve got this collectible, and we want people to collect this thing, and we want you to buy it, and there\u0027s a limited supply.\" Now, the transition is less about this exclusive collectible and more about all these little components that make up a brand story, everything from an earnings report to the goods you produce. And the primary driver of this is Layer-2 blockchains.\n\nA few years ago, this kind of on-chain marketing and relationship with customers wasn\u0027t possible because everything was on Layer-1 Ethereum, gas costs were expensive, and they only got more expensive. This was the era of the 10,000 PFP collections in NFTs. The costs were such that you couldn\u0027t have a million or half a million people mint your earnings report; that just wasn\u0027t feasible. Having 500,000 to 1 million people engage with you on-chain only made sense when L2s came around- Base being one of the best examples of an L2 lowering transaction costs and allowing more opportunities for on-chain engagement.\n\nWhy is being on-chain so important for brands to utilize?\n\nKauffman: The most important aspect of on-chain marketing for brands is that it gives them a direct relationship with their customers. For consumers, they have more control of the relationship because they hold and control the tokens in their wallet.\n\nThis gives brands the ability to engage their customers within any on-chain enabled experience because the token is the link in the relationship. A couple of years ago this was more theory than reality. But, now with the rise of Web3 social, we�re seeing this play out in realtime. We�re not far from the day when an on-chain user experience on the internet is much better than the user experience with today�s internet. Cheaper fees and faster transaction costs on L2s are making this possible, which is driving new product and user experience designs that are only possible with the interoperability and composability of on-chain experiences.\n\nI also wanted to ask, through your work with JUMP, what do you see the ad executives often get wrong or misunderstand about Web3?\n\nKauffman: Many of the marketers in these institutions are intelligent and capable and understand a lot about the space. But they\u0027re in handcuffs because these legacy brands and institutions were built around different marketing laws of physics. In Web3, there\u0027s a different level of physics within the ecosystems, and legacy institutions can\u0027t get out of their own way.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense, so instead of taking a cookie-cutter copy/paste approach, it needs to be more conscious and intentional?\n\nKauffman: A critical question to ask is �What do we do in Web3 that we couldn\u0027t do in Web2?� And it goes back to the other question, �Why blockchain?� If you keep pushing through a hundred of those scenarios, keep asking \"why blockchain\", and realize that you don\u0027t need blockchain or Web3 to do it, well, now you\u0027ve just iteratively gone through all of the ideas that you shouldn\u0027t have launched in the first place as a Web3 initiative. You eventually get to the thing where you\u0027re like, \"Ah, this can only be done with blockchain. Now, we can definitively answer the question, why blockchain and why Web3.�\n\nLet\u0027s circle back to Web3 social and how it\u0027s influencing the future of marketing.\n\nKauffman: Yeah, absolutely. So, the most dominant player right now is Farcaster. But Zora is very close and exciting, and then you have Lens. But if you could only spend your time in one place, it\u0027s Farcaster. So what\u0027s happening here is that this Web3 social network and Web3 social in general is bringing users and content on-chain. At a high level, other apps, experiences, and brands can then tap into the social graph facilitated through Farcaster and the content on these social networks to build new experiences.\n\nCan you give me an example of that?\n\nKauffman: We can use Paragraph, which is a Web3 Substack. If you have a Farcaster account and you\u0027re active and you go to Paragraph and you create your Web3 substack or blog, you\u0027ll immediately be shown your farcaster social graph, and everyone you follow on Farcaster, their paragraph accounts will be shown to you and you can subscribe and follow them. This is something we thought would happen in Web2, but, because of the walled-garden nature and because of the privacy component, because users didn\u0027t own their content and identity in these social graphs, it became difficult to make this interoperable, portable social graph, of just network connections and people connections and the content itself as well.\n\nBecause you own your Farcaster ID, that sits in your wallet along with the content you produce, now it becomes portable. Now other brands and apps can launch and tap into that social graph and content graph. And immediately pull that in, which immediately creates this element of social graphs moving around the internet together in and out these different apps and continually being connected.\n\nSo, everytime I go to use a new app that is tapping into this Web3 social protocol, everytime I go to use a new app, that app has much more utility because I am immediately able to find the other people in my Farcaster social graph who are using this app and look at what they\u0027re doing on this new app that is tapping into what Farcaster has built.\n\nGive us a sense of the future.\n\nKauffman: Let\u0027s go to 2030. Elon Musk is landing on Mars, and there\u0027s this big ephemeral moment. You have hundreds of millions of people using Web3 social media, and you could, in theory, have an app that springs up that\u0027s really tailored to that moment, as well as content consumption and the conversation that is going on at that moment. A billion people use the app, and the moment the app goes away, the app goes away.\n\nSo, Web3 social, from a marketer\u0027s perspective, is the one area if you were to ask, \"Where I am going to spend my time as a marketer,\" I would say that I am going to spend my time with Web3 social. Spend your time there, use these protocols and Web3 social platforms, and join the communities there. The ROI for your exploration and time investment is a good bet.\n\n",

The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March.\n\nSuch a move, coupled with demand from traditional finance, could see bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,700.\n\n�We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of nearly $74,000,� QCP traders said. �The desk saw sizeable buyers of $100K-$120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot.�\n\n�Institutional demand for bitcoin continues to grow, with large asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld investing approximately 3% and 2% of their AUM into the BTC spot ETF,� they added.\n\nMultiple filings on Wednesday showed that several big-name funds, such as Millenium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios.\n\nMeanwhile, some analysts say the selling pressure on bitcoin appears to have eased off, citing on-chain and exchange data.\n\n�Short-term Bitcoin holders are selling at basically zero profit and traders are depleting their unrealized profits in the last few months,� CryptoQuant analysts shared in a Thursday report. �Bitcoin balances at OTC desks stabilizing, which suggests there is less Bitcoin supply coming into the market to sell via these entities.�\n\nThe firm defines short-term traders as addresses that hold bitcoin for less than 155 days and are likely to capitalize on short-term price movements.\n\nA breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility. Since March, the market has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000, with the halving event in April not providing the expected boost due to a general lack of market catalysts, traders have previously said.\n\nHigher risk appetite for token bets showed signs of beginning earlier this week after an X post by retail trader Keith Gill sent some meme stocks and meme coins surging.\n\nGill\u0027s online persona and investment strategies contributed to a short squeeze on video game retailer GameStop�s stock in 2021, and his first post on social application X in three years was considered by some to be a sign of market volatility in the months ahead.\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin�s (BTC) much anticipated halving event later this month could see a flurry of bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting upside on both technical and meme coin projects.\n\nHalving reduces the rate at which new coins are created and lowers the available new supply. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. This event has historically preceded a bull market for the token.\n\nCrypto traders say participants seek a �reason to buy� as money narratives continuously shift in the current bullish environment and they may turn their focus on the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming weeks.\n\n�There exists a large, untapped pool of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem that remains dormant, and surprisingly few listed assets that traders can use to gain exposure to the narrative,� the OTC desk of trading firm Wintermute told CoinDesk over email.\n\n�Should capital begin to rotate into the Bitcoin ecosystem, tokens like $RUNE, $STX, and $ORDI could benefit significantly and outperform,� they added.\n\nTHORChain�s RUNE and Stack�s STX have been among the top-performing tokens in the past year, CoinGecko data shows, tracking a bitcoin rise. Meme coin ordi (ORDI) � a nod to the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin � has surged over 2,500% since its September issuance.\n\nMeanwhile, Bartosz Lipinski is the founder of the crypto trading platform Cube.Exchange said in an email that meme coins and the upcoming Runes protocol could rile up risky bets in the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n�Ethereum�s high costs and significant network congestion will cause it to take a backseat as Bitcoin-based projects, like Rune, will redirect meme coin hype to the Bitcoin ecosystem because of the novelty,� Lipinski said. �The BRC-20 (Ordinals NFT) standard is likely to be overtaken by Runes, which is expected to launch on the day of the halving.�\n\n�Runes will aim to replace the standard with fungible tokens, which will enable the efficient creation of meme coins to compete with projects on Base and Solana,� he added, referring to the ongoing frenzy for non-serious tokens in the two ecosystems.\n\nOrdinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.\n\nOrdinal volumes were higher than those of usual leaders Ethereum and Solana in the past week, as reported, led by NodeMonkes and Pups. Non-fungible token (NFT) on other networks buying and selling activity declined 95% across all networks in the same period, suggestive of an isolated interest in Ordinals.\n\n",

    "title": "CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger on Overzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative Action\n\n",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The commodities regulator has been clear about the dangers of regulating a burgeoning industry through enforcement actions.\n\n",
    "content": "Commissioner Summer Mersinger, of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is one of the few U.S. regulators who is routinely willing to defend the crypto industry and call out what she sees as overzealous oversight. She will be speaking at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas, on May 30.\n\nCoinDesk caught up with Mersinger to discuss the Cain and Abel rivalry between the CFTC and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), how her agency decides which enforcement actions to pursue and her views on a variety of issues, including the CME possibly getting into the spot bitcoin market, the emerging world of betting markets and Washington D.C. traffic.\n\nIs it an accurate view that the SEC and the CFTC are in somewhat of a turf war over crypto?\n\nI think there are certainly questions around who has the appropriate authority. There are people between the two agencies who are willing to work together, in fact, at Consensus Commissioner Peirce and I will be speaking together. We have some similar views. But it is a struggle because, sometimes where debate has been leveled � whether it\u0027s an enforcement case or another action we have said falls under our fraud and manipulation enforcement authority � we\u0027re seeing the SEC start to ask questions as though it falls under their jurisdiction. And so there is certainly some tension there. It�s largely the lack of clarity that\u0027s really causing the tension.\n\nYou\u0027re in a minority position as a regulator who�s somewhat favorable to crypto. Could you just explain why it is that you\u0027re willing to stick your neck out?\n\nPart of the reason I went into government, generally, is that � while there\u0027s a need for government in people\u0027s lives � we don\u0027t want to overstep. We also want to make sure the rules of the road are clear so that people can abide by the law. This is an area where there is a real problem. A lot of people are very interested in investing in, or trading, cryptocurrencies, and we have not provided any clarity � we\u0027ve made it very murky. That\u0027s not what the government should be doing. It�s creating a situation where you have people relying on the word of a regulator, and the rules of the game are being changed in the middle of the play.\n\nI still think it\u0027s important that we speak up and let people know that, whether you like crypto or not, that\u0027s not the point here. The point is that regulators have really made this confusing and difficult.\n\nDo you agree with Commissioner Pham�s idea that the Government Accountability Office should investigate the CFTC\u0027s enforcement actions?\n\nCOMMISSIONER MERSINGER: It�s difficult to ask another agency to come in and look at the internal workings of the CFTC. I understand where Commissioner Pham is coming from and I think it\u0027s that same kind of feeling that we shouldn\u0027t be regulating through enforcement. But I also think this is a leadership question. I greatly respect Chairman Behnam, but this is an issue with the political direction from this White House. So, instead of an audit, we need to ask: Is the problem the agency, or the current political leadership driving our agenda and broadly stifling financial innovation?\n\nI don\u0027t want to put words in your mouth, but is this to suggest that the regulatory landscape would improve if Trump was re-elected in November?\n\nThere are clear differences between President Biden and former President Trump, so that does drive the regulatory agenda. So, if leadership changes, you would certainly assume there would be new policies and a new regulatory agenda.\n\nI\u0027m curious to what extent you\u0027re in active dialogue with Congressmembers about potential crypto legislation?\n\nThey use us as a resource. We talk to members of the House Financial Services Committee, the Agriculture Committee, and certainly members of the Senate and work with them on where there is ambiguity in the laws or opportunities to make some delineations and clear paths for regulation. It�s offering our assistance and expertise and it�s helpful to have those conversations because they also want to make sure we\u0027re able to implement the laws that they pass. They may have great intentions, but if it\u0027s impossible for the agency to implement then it�s useless.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. Do you think that there needs to be bespoke crypto legislation or would new interpretations of existing laws suffice?\n\nThere are some who believe we can use current statutory authority, whether the SEC or the CFTC, to regulate � which is where we see regulation through enforcement actions. I disagree. The only way to get past just bringing enforcement actions is to have something come out of Congress that says �here\u0027s how to handle cryptocurrencies.�\n\nSee also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)\n\nBeyond legislation, the two agencies also need to sit down and come up with some joint rulemaking. We did that with Dodd Frank, and we certainly could do that here. That�s an important piece of making sure people know which regulator is going to regulate them, which door to walk into. There\u0027s no question that without statutory changes to ensure it\u0027s very clear where the jurisdiction is, agencies will try to go in separate directions.\n\nI know every enforcement action is primarily driven by facts on the ground. But I think it might be interesting to get a view into how these cases are built. What is the process of building a case against someone like Avi Eisenberg?\n\nWithout talking about any specific enforcement cases, with a lot of these cases it\u0027s been whistleblower reports saying �I think somebody is violating the law.� It could be a victim who says they lost money, and I don\u0027t think what they\u0027re doing is legal. We have a pretty large team of enforcement investigators and attorneys who start building a case. By the time it gets to us at the commission, usually the facts have been pretty well established and how they line up with the law. We\u0027re kind of like a jury that decides whether the facts meet our statutory requirements.\n\nA lot of it is done by the enforcement team that might interview the whistleblower and other employees, get documents. A lot of time goes into each case before it gets to the commission for a vote. There\u0027s also a lot of cooperation between the various agencies, whether it\u0027s the DOJ, state regulators or the SEC. So where there\u0027s opportunities to bring cases under multiple statutes, or different regulators, they\u0027ll work together. It\u0027s more efficient for the government if they can work together. They can also tip each other off. If we had to get every lead, I think it\u0027d be really difficult.\n\nNow one distinction I want to make is you hear a lot of numbers around crypto enforcement cases. I think it\u0027s a little unfair because a lot of these cases are just run of the mill fraud; somebody stealing someone else\u0027s money, someone claiming to buy crypto, but not actually buying the crypto. So we\u0027ve seen this play out with whatever the hot topic is at the time. I\u0027d say every few years the theme changes � it was foreign currencies, it was metals, we saw a lot of gold fraud. Right now crypto is the hot thing. A lot of cases have been portrayed as cryptocurrency fraud, but it\u0027s just fraud with a crypto wrapper around it. So tomorrow, it might be AI fraud.\n\nI almost hate to say it, but given how much fraud centers around crypto, do you think that there should be more enforcement actions?\n\nI think when it\u0027s straight up fraud, yes. There\u0027s a distinction here when you have a case where somebody just takes your money and claims to invest in something and never does � there\u0027s no question who has the authority there. The more we can try to shut some of this down, the better.\n\nBut where there\u0027s a policy question around a certain activity and how our statute would fit with that activity, that\u0027s where I get a little nervous. For instance, if we\u0027re looking at a DeFi protocol, and we\u0027re saying they\u0027re violating our statute it can be difficult if we\u0027ve never really said how our statute applies to DeFi.\n\nWe�re starting to set out definitions and interpretations based on court cases, because sometimes you\u0027ll find use cases where there are bad actors. Sometimes it\u0027s people who want to abide by the law, but there\u0027s no clear way how they would do that. That\u0027s why I think we\u0027d be better off with rulemaking.\n\nWhat do you make of the argument that the SEC implicitly said that Ethereum is a commodity when futures went live in 2021?\n\nSo this is an interesting question in development. We do have futures products trading on ether. And I do think if somebody decides that ether is a security, it calls into question what happens. We\u0027ve [the CFTC] been regulating those contracts. They operated well, we have no concerns. This was an area where we thought there was clarity, and now we\u0027re not quite sure if there\u0027s clarity and that\u0027s dangerous.\n\nThe law is a little strange; commodities can be a lot of other things � you can have a commodity that is a security. The nomenclature gets a little tricky the way the law is written. But we\u0027ve said we believe this is a commodity and we\u0027re going to regulate it as such under CFTC jurisdiction because it is a derivative product. To me that has been clearly laid out and we shouldn\u0027t be introducing new kinds of questions around what has been a clear policy.\n\nGiven how interrelated these assets are, do you think the U.S. would be better off with a single unified agency, like the U.K.�s FCA?\n\nI\u0027m always hesitant to recommend any new government agencies or adding more government. History has shown that more government has never been the answer. But I do think sometimes you\u0027ve got to better tailor statutes. Crypto doesn\u0027t neatly fit into any of our financial categories, so we\u0027re gonna have to fine tune some of the law. That\u0027s what Congress does, so we can easily do this without any new agency.\n\nWhy is the CFTC so against betting markets?\n\nIt\u0027s a very tough, difficult topic because there\u0027s a lot of nuance. So these markets, which we call event contracts, are part of our statute that was added under the Dodd Frank Act. In the grand scheme of things, it\u0027s relatively new, but we\u0027ve seen interest in these contracts for quite some time and it\u0027s certainly ramping up. The way Congress laid it out for us it said these contracts generally are OK, as long as they don\u0027t touch on a number of topics, like gaming, war, terrorism, assassination � anything that\u0027s against federal law. There are a number of people who really don\u0027t like election contracts and would like to include them in this list.\n\nThen there\u0027s this public interest piece that tries to determine whether having this contract would be against the public interest. It\u0027s not necessarily that we are against these markets, but there have to be some guardrails. Congress directed us to have some guardrails, and we�re trying to build them. You see that with our recent vote. My feeling is if that\u0027s the route you want to take, you still have to do a public interest determination for every contract, which is why I dissented because we were limiting elections as a category.\n\nSee also: \u0027What Are We Waiting for\u0027? SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce on Crypto Regulation\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to create a framework where if you\u0027re registered with us, you won�t have a legal question every time you try to do something new. We are just struggling a little bit with the approach. Congress tried to help us create clarity, but certainly left a lot of a lot left to the regulator to figure out.\n\nThe Financial Times reported today that CME is thinking about listing spot bitcoin trading, not not just bitcoin futures. Is that something that you are supportive of?\n\nYou know, the first time I heard about it was this morning as well, so I haven\u0027t had those conversations. I want to talk a little bit more with CME and with our staff to find out what this means. There\u0027s a lot of questions around custody and other issues. So right now, I don\u0027t have a positive or negative opinion and honestly, as a regulator, I shouldn\u0027t. They should be able to make those market decisions as long as they\u0027re following the rules. We try to be a regulator that is principles based and let our registered entities run the markets, because that\u0027s what they do. Our job is just to make sure everyone\u0027s following the rules.\n\nQuick round of overrated/underrated? You could decline to answer or clarify your position. DeFi?\n\nI don\u0027t have a position one way or the other. I just think as a regulator, we should have clear rules of the road for DeFi.\n\nWashington D.C.?\n\nYou know, I\u0027m gonna say Washington D.C. is a little overrated. Mostly because I was just in the Midwest where there was no traffic. It was very pleasant.\n\nGary Gensler?\n\nNeutral. You know, I\u0027ve never met him. So I try to withhold my opinions of people until I\u0027ve had a chance to sit down and get to know them.\n\nThe phrase �sufficiently decentralized?�\n\nYou\u0027re either decentralized or you\u0027re not. So I think sufficiently decentralized feels a little overrated because I don\u0027t know what that means. It probably means you\u0027re not decentralized.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to at Consensus?\n\nThe conversations with so many different stakeholders. This is an opportunity to talk with people we ordinarily wouldn�t see in Washington, D.C. and to have them all in one place is really special.\n\nThank you again for the time. Nice to meet you both.\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you.\n\n",

    "summary": "Following the SEC charges against the world�s largest crypto exchange, people are wondering what�s the difference between Binance and Binance.us, who is Changpeng Zhao and more.\n\n",
    "content": "Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who is often referred to as just �CZ,� Binance is the world\u0027s leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of June 2023. The company was originally based in China but had to leave Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions shortly after its launch.\n\nBinance developed its own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (later renamed to BNB Chain), which facilitates trades on the exchange. The native token of the blockchain is Binance coin (BNB) and the company has also launched a stablecoin, BinanceUSD (BUSD). Because of U.S. regulatory rules, Binance created a supposedly separate company for its U.S. clients in 2019, Binance.US.\n\nOn June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US as well as CZ, who serves as Binance CEO, on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering BNB and BUSD to the general public, calling them unregistered securities. The SEC lawsuit also casts fresh doubt on the independence of the company�s U.S. arm and its staking service.\n\nRead more about the SEC suit here\n\nThis is not Binance�s first battle with U.S. regulators. Binance is also under ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who sued CZ and Binance in March 2023, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao.\n\nCZ is a well-known personality in crypto, actively engaging with the crypto community through Twitter and speaking at conferences and to the media. As for his origins, he was born in China and emigrated to Canada when he was 12 and says he is a Canadian citizen. In high school, he worked part-time at McDonald�s, which is part of his well-known lore. He graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science.\n\nAfter college, he worked for the Tokyo stock exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook developing software for the businesses. He then founded a startup in 2005, Fusion Systems, which focused on creating an automated high-frequency trading platform. Following that, he worked for several crypto startups including a stint as co-founder and CTO of OKCoin. Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.\n\nAccording to the white paper, Zhao\u0027s goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure � including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support.\n\nShortly after Binance�s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper.\n\nBinance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China�s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance�s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based.\n\nBinance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance\u0027s proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange.\n\nBinance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance�s services.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange.\n\nThe other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees.\n\nFinally, unlike Binance�s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange.\n\nJuly 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO.\n\nJuly 2018: Binance acquires Trust Wallet, a free, non-custodial mobile wallet to support its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) offering.\n\nJanuary 2019: Binance starts to offer support for new token listings through ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings), through its Launchpad product.\n\nApril 2019: Binance migrates BNB from Ethereum to its proprietary chain, then called Binance Smart Chain (now rebranded to Binance chain or BNB chain)\n\nApril 2019: Binance launches its DEX ahead of schedule.\n\nMay 2019: Binance gets hacked for the first time. Hackers steal over 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) from Binance (the equivalent of roughly $41 million at the time). Zhao quickly took to social media to reassure users that no one lost funds and that Binance used its reserve funds to cover the costs of the stolen crypto. CZ\u0027s \"Funds are #SAFU\" tweet has become a meme in the crypto space.\n\nJune 2019: Binance announces it will launch a new trading platform for U.S. customers, in partnership with a firm called BAM Trading Services.\n\nJuly 2019: Binance hires former Ripple executive, Catherine Coley, to run its planned U.S. marketplace.\n\nSeptember 2019: Binance launches its own dollar-backed stablecoin, BUSD in partnership with the Paxos Trust Company.\n\nSeptember 2019: Binance.US launches in 37 states. The new marketplace supports six cryptocurrencies at launch: bitcoin, (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and BNB. BUSD is notably not supported at launch.\n\nApril 2020: Binance buys CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data provider, for a rumored $400 million, making it one of the biggest M\u0026A deals in crypto. �CoinMarketCap has more users than any other product in the crypto space,� Zhao said at the time. �It�s a very valuable platform.�\n\nSeptember 2020: Binance rolls out Launchpool, a crypto staking platform.\n\nNovember 2020: Binance notifies U.S. customers they have a hard deadline of two weeks to migrate to the new platform before Binance shutters their accounts.\n\nApril 2021: Binance.US hires Brian Brooks as CEO to replace Catherine Coley in the role.\n\nAugust 2021: Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks quits over �strategic differences� after just months in the job.\n\nSeptember 2021: Binance.US promotes Brian Schroder to CEO; he formerly served as president and board member for the firm.\n\nApril 2022: Binance.US raises $200 million in its first funding round, giving it a $4.5 billion valuation.\n\nSeptember 2022: Binance announces it will stop supporting the second-largest stablecoin USDC and automatically convert customer funds to BUSD.\n\nOctober 2022: Binance suffers another major hack, and had to briefly halt trading on BNB after a �potential exploit� drained $100 million in crypto.\n\nOctober 2022: Binance confirms it has contributed $500 million towards Elon Musk�s bid to buy Twitter.\n\nNovember 2022: Amidst the collapse of FTX, there was a brief moment when Binance was going to buy the rival exchange. That deal quickly collapsed as the scope of FTX�s issues came to light.\n\nDecember 2022: Binance.US reaches an agreement to buy Voyager Digital\u0027s assets for just over $1 billion. Voyager, had gone into bankruptcy earlier in 2022 and originally had agreed to sell its assets to FTX, which folded itself.\n\nFebruary 2023: BUSD issuer Paxos is hit with a one-two punch of an investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice from the SEC, which some believed hinted at Binance as a future target for the SEC. Following these actions, Paxos halted minting BUSD.\n\nMarch 2023: The CFTC sues CZ and Binance over allegations that the company offered unregistered crypto derivatives products.\n\nApril 2023: Rumors of an Interpol �Red Notice� for CZ tank BNB price, but there is little to back up the claim.\n\nApril 2023: Binance.US pulls out of a $1 billion deal to buy Voyager Digital�s assets, attributing the termination to the \"hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.\"\n\nJune 2023: The SEC files charges against Binance.US and its founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws with BNB token and Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin. The suit also alleges that Binance\u0027s staking service violated securities law as well as that the entities of Binance.US and Binance were not truly independent.\n\n",
