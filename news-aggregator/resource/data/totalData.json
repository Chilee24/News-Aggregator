    "content": "Crypto analyst TechDev has provided insights into the Bitcoin (BTC) future trajectory. The analyst hinted that the flagship crypto was currently mirroring its price action in 2017 and could soon make a parabolic rise like it did back then. History Could Repeat Itself TechDev shared a chart on his X (formerly Twitter) platform with the caption, “The more things change, the more they stay the same.” The chart showed that Bitcoin’s current price action was mirroring that of the 2017 bull run when it recorded a price gain of 1,200% on its way to a previous high of $20,000. Related Reading This Crypto Trader Just Sold All His Bitcoin For Altcoins Like Cardano And XRP, Here’s Why 3 days ago Source: X Interestingly, just like in 2017, when Bitcoin’s price bottomed following the Bitfinex crash, the crypto token also looked to have bottomed in this market cycle when FTX, another crypto exchange, collapsed. Back then, Bitcoin consolidated for some time before enjoying a parabolic rally, which made it reach $20,000 in 2018. As TechDev suggested, history could repeat itself with Bitcoin consolidating ahead of a move that could send it to as high as $100,000. From the chart the crypto analyst shared, one could see that Bitcoin has consolidated longer in this market cycle than it did in 2017. However, crypto analyst Rekt Capital hinted that this longer period of consolidation was necessary. He mentioned that Bitcoin was accelerating by almost 200 days in this market cycle and added that consolidating for longer will help it resynchronize with previous bull cycles. This strategic consolidation is a reassuring sign of Bitcoin’s stability and potential for growth. Meanwhile, in a recent X post, he revealed that Bitcoin was already attempting to perform the “post Bull Flag breakout retest,” which could secure a trend continuation to the upside. Source: X In a subsequent X post, Rekt Capital shared a chart showing that a breakout from the $66,000 range could kickstart the continuation of Bitcoin’s bull run, which could well send its price above $100,000. “Optimal Targets” For Bitcoin In This Market Cycle Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto mentioned in an X post that the optimal targets for Bitcoin in this bull run should be between $138,000 and $150,000. Interestingly, he made this statement while revealing that the crypto’s current price action is mirroring that of 2017. The crypto analyst’s prediction suggests that Bitcoin enjoying a 1,200% price gain (like in 2017) is unlikely. Related Reading Cardano Whales Return To The Table, Increase Massive Holdings By 10% 3 days ago However, it is worth noting that other crypto analysts like PlanB have offered more bullish predictions for Bitcoin, which indicates that the flagship crypto could still see a 10x increase from its current price level. Specifically, PlanB predicted that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $1 million in 2025, which would be the market top for the crypto token. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,000, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "content": "An analyst has explained how the current Bitcoin surge appears to have hit the halfway completion mark if this indicator is to go by. Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator Suggests BTC Rally Only Halfway Done In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has posted an update for how the Bitcoin Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator is looking like after the latest rally. The VWAP is an indicator that, as its full form suggests, calculates an average price for the cryptocurrency based on not just the changes in the price over the day but also the volume that was traded at these prices. Related Reading Litecoin Whales Go On $230 Million Buying Spree: Will This Change LTC’s Stars? 1 day ago Normally, this volume is measured using the spot volume data provided by centralized exchanges. Still, in the case of Bitcoin, the blockchain is available for anyone to explore, so on-chain volume is used to calculate the VWAP instead. The VWAP Oscillator, which is the actual metric of interest here, takes the ratio between the cryptocurrency’s spot price and the VWAP and represents it as an oscillator around zero. Earlier in the month, Woo had pointed out how the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator was forming a bullish divergence for the asset. How the VWAP Oscillator looked like earlier in the month | Source: @woonomic on X As is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator climbed up inside the negative territory after forming an apparent bottom back then. At the same time, the cryptocurrency’s price had been heading down instead. In the past, such a setup has proven to be bullish for the coin, and the resulting bullish momentum usually lasts until the VWAP Oscillator tops out in positive territory. As such, the analyst remarked that the coin had a lot of room to run back then. Since then, the price has experienced a recovery rally, potentially suggesting that the bullish divergence may be paying off. As Woo pointed out, the indicator has returned to the neutral mark after this run. It looks like the value of the metric is making a break into the positive territory | Source: @woonomic on X Based on the fact that tops in the past have occurred after the metric peaks in the positive territory and based on the scale of these peaks usually, the analyst concludes, “this Bitcoin move is now at the halfway mark.” Related Reading Bulls In Control: Ethereum Longs See Biggest Candle Ever After ETF News 19 hours ago As for how things could play out next, the analyst says, Consolidation under all-time-high needs to happen for a little, then we see if the second leg gives us escape velocity to new highs which will open up the flood gates. Woo has also shared a “risk signal” for Bitcoin, which shows where the asset is when looking at the bigger picture. The data for the BTC risk signal over the last few years | Source: @woonomic on X BTC may be in that part of the cycle where risk begins to drive up as price reacts violently to capital inflows. “That’s where most of the fast gains happen,” notes the analyst.

    "summary": "Crypto analyst Dark Defender makes a compelling case for a potential significant rise in the price of XRP.\n\n",
    "content": "In a recent analysis provided by the crypto analyst Dark Defender, a compelling case has been made for the potential significant rise in the price of XRP. Through a detailed examination of the XRP/USD chart on a monthly time frame, as sourced from Binance, Dark Defender highlights a large bullish formation, which he describes as a “bull flag” across multiple longer-term time frames including monthly, three-month, and six-month charts. XRP Price Gears Up For Explosive Move The analysis shows a substantial initial upsurge in price marked by a green arrow, suggesting a strong bullish momentum that started around early 2017 and peaked later that year. The price action following this peak is what Dark Defender identifies as a bull flag pattern. This pattern is characterized by a period of consolidation following a sharp movement in price, resembling a flag on a pole. XRP price analysis | Source: X @DefendDark The consolidation, traced with a red descending trend line and a blue ascending trend line, forms a converging pattern known as a triangle, which typically suggests that the period of consolidation is nearing an end as the lines converge. According to Dark Defender, this suggests a breakout is imminent. Related Reading XRP \u0026 Cardano Whales Load Up Bags: Preparation For Altcoin Rally? 5 days ago “I have read some posts that XRP had a bull flag in the daily time frame, etc. If those are correction bull flags, this is a bull flag, too. But a bullish one. It is in the monthly, three-month, and six-month time frames. If you know a bull flag, you can enjoy your coffee today. Cheers,” he stated. In his forecast, Dark Defender uses the flag pole and Fibonacci extension levels to predict future price points. After the expected breakout above the red resistance line, the first target is situated at the 161.80% Fibonacci level, which would bring XRP to approximately $1.88. A further ambitious target is set at the 261.80% Fibonacci level, priced at about $5.86. The most optimistic target lies at the 361.80% Fibonacci level, forecasting the price to soar as high as approximately $18.23. Notably, Dark Defender’s blue line, analogous in length to the flagpole, shows that the XRP price could rise well above $18. Different Analysis, Similar Price Targets This analysis was further commented on by another renowned XRP community analyst, EGRAG CRYPTO, who brought attention to the fact that the flag portion of the pattern extends beyond half the length of the initial pole, a structural detail that might typically invalidate the bull flag designation. Related Reading Buckle Up, XRP Fans: Analyst Eyes Price Explosion To $0.65 In Next 5 Days 6 days ago “I’ve dabbled in this analysis before, but lately, I’ve become increasingly intrigued by the potential of a symmetrical triangle breakout. What caught my eye is that the Flag is extending beyond half the length of the Pole which invalidates the structure. Regardless of who’s right or wrong, hope to meet in the near future and being multimillionaires. Keep up the fantastic work,” Egrag noted. Despite this technical caveat, EGRAG CRYPTO remains positive about the potential of a symmetrical triangle breakout. In a recent analysis of the weekly chart, EGRAG elaborated that XRP will at least explode towards $1.5 if price breaks out to the upside of the triangle. On a broader triangle pattern, EGRAG expects a move to $5.89. XRP price analysis | Source: X @egragcrypto “XRP Army, STAY STEADY! There’s a mini pump to $1.5 and a major pump to $5.89 in the cards, with the MACRO pump potentially soaring above 2 digits,” he stated. Despite their different approaches, the two analysts are therefore very close in their analyses. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5189.

    "content": "Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency, is currently demonstrating signals that suggest it might be on the cusp of a significant bullish breakout. According to a recent analysis from prominent crypto analyst Ali, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency appears to be approaching a crucial resistance level, with market behaviors hinting at potential upward movement. Related Reading Did A Dogecoin Whale Just Sink The DOGE Ship? The $30-Million Transfer Mystery 4 days ago Eyes Set On Breaking The $0.2 Resistance Level Ali, a well-known market analyst, pointed out that Dogecoin is testing the possibility of reaching its highest price level in over a month at $0.2. His analysis is based on DOGE’s recent escape from a descending triangle pattern, which typically suggests a shift in market dynamics favoring buyers. Following a pattern similar to the previous cycle, where DOGE experienced a retracement after breaking out from a descending pattern before rallying, the asset has recently completed a significant 47% retracement. This movement has led Ali to highlight the market’s tendency to echo past patterns, though not perfectly. With the breakout from the descending pattern and subsequent retracement now complete, DOGE is positioning itself for another push toward the $0.2 resistance level. History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes!! https://t.co/qr9BG5QnjH — Ali (@ali_charts) May 21, 2024 This level has proven challenging, with selling pressure frequently intensifying around this range. However, the broader market sentiment remains bullish, which could support Dogecoin’s push toward this key price point. Notably, to reach $0.2, DOGE would need to increase further by nearly 20% from its current position. Currently, the memecoin is trading at $0.168, reflecting a 10% increase over the past 24 hours and continuing a week-long uptrend that has seen nearly a 15% increase. DOGE price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart. Source: DOGE/USDT on TradingView.com Surging Interest In Dogecoin And Strong Upside Signal The positive movement in DOGE’s price performance is further underscored by a surge in DOGE’s open interest, which has risen by 23% in the past day to reach $1 billion, according to data from Coinglass. DOGE Futures Open Interest (USD).| Source: Coinglass Additionally, the open interest volume has soared by 200%, now at nearly $4 billion. An increase in open interest indicates that new market participants are entering or existing positions are being expanded.

Echoing Ali’s sentiment, another analyst from Crypto Daily Trade Signals identified a symmetrical triangle pattern in DOGE’s price movements, reinforcing the potential for continued upward momentum.

    "content": "Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, the co-founders of the on-chain analytics platform Glassnode, recently suggested that Solana (SOL) could make a significant move to the upside in its Ethereum pair. They alluded to the likelihood of Ethereum rising higher as another reason SOL will likely “soar.” Solana To Make A 90% Move Against Ethereum Happel and Allemann, through their shared X account (@Negentropic), highlighted a “clear Cup and Handle pattern” on the SOLETH chart, which suggests Solana will move 90% from its current price level. They also noted that the SOLETH ratio has been consolidating for some time now and looks ready for such a move to the upside. Related Reading Bitcoin Price Mirrors Historical Pattern That Led To $1,200 Surge, Will History Repeat Itself? 1 day ago Source: X Meanwhile, they also predict SOL will soar because they expect Ethereum “to move much higher.” Therefore, a rally for the second-largest crypto token could also spark a significant move for Solana. Interestingly, this move already looks to be in play, seeing that SOL enjoyed up to a 7% price gain on the back of Ethereum’s price rally in the last 24 hours. Therefore, Solana could rise higher as ETH continues to enjoy an upward trend following reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve the pending Spot Ethereum ETF applications. A 90% move for Solana means the crypto token could come close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $260. Crypto analyst Javon Marks had before now predicted that SOL could make such a move, noting that a price gain of 54% may already be in the pipeline. He further claimed that Solana achieving this price move would open up room for another price rally of 93%, which would send SOL’s price to $453. How High Can SOL Rise In This Bull Run? Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa has predicted that Solana could rise to as high as $500 by year-end, while crypto analyst Hansolar predicts that Solana could hit $600 in this market cycle. Crypto YouTuber Jake Gagain offered a more bullish prediction, stating that Solana will rise to $750, although he predicts that will happen next year. Related Reading Bitcoin Rally Incoming: This Major BTC Metric Just Turned Bullish Once Again 1 day ago Interstingly, Hansolar claimed that SOL could be the new Ethereum in this cycle. ETH is known to have been one of the biggest gainers in the last bull run, with its price more than tripling on its way to its current ATH of $4,891. Ethereum’s run then was thanks to its decentralized finance (DeFi) utility, with many DeFi projects utilizing the network. Asset manager Franklin Templeton suggested that Solana will onboard the projects that will drive the next wave of crypto adoption. Therefore, Solana could undoubtedly enjoy the kind of run Ethereum did in 2021. This explains why the asset manager is bullish on SOL’s growth, as they predict it will eventually become the third-largest crypto token after Bitcoin and Ethereum.

    "content": "An analyst has explained how profit-taking looks to have finished for Bitcoin in what has been a “very healthy reset” for the market. Bitcoin SOPR Suggests Profit-Taking From Investors Has Cooled Off In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed about the latest trend occurring in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). The SOPR is an on-chain indicator that basically tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling their coins at a profit or loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the average holder in the sector could be assumed to be moving coins at some net profit currently. On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies loss realization is the dominant mode of selling in the market. Related Reading Chainlink Becomes Crypto Winner With 21% Rally: What’s Driving This? 4 days ago Naturally, the SOPR being exactly equal to 1 suggests the total profits being realized are exactly equal to the losses at the moment and thus, the investors are just breaking-even on their selling. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been neutral in recent days | Source: @woonomic on X As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOPR had spiked to highly positive levels earlier when the cryptocurrency’s price had observed its rally towards a new all-time high (ATH). This would suggest that the investors had been participating in some aggressive profit-taking during this run. From the chart, it’s visible that such a trend was also observed around the start of the 2021 bull run. With the consolidation, the asset has gone through since the ATH, the indicator’s value has also seen a cooldown. As Woo has highlighted in the chart, the metric has now approached the neutral mark. It would appear that two months after the profit-taking peaked, the appetite for harvesting gains has potentially finally disappeared among the investors. The analyst says this is a very healthy reset for the cryptocurrency, especially as the capital inflows have once again been picking up for the coin. Looks like the indicator has gone through a turnaround recently | Source: @woonomic From the chart, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin network flows had been following an overall downward trajectory earlier when the consolidation was taking place, but recently, capital injections into the coin have once again been on the rise. Related Reading Bitcoin Still Has “A Lot Of Room To Run Before Reversal,” Says Top Analyst 5 days ago This is a similar trend to what was observed earlier in the year during the crash following the approval of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The turnabout in capital inflows back then was what led into the rally that took the cryptocurrency to the current ATH. BTC Price Bitcoin had seen a pullback under $66,000 yesterday, raising worries that the recovery surge had already fizzled out. This drop only lasted briefly, though, as the coin has returned above $67,000 today.

    "content": "In a noteworthy development for Shiba Inu investors and traders, well-known cryptocurrency analyst and enthusiast Javon Marks has verified SHIB’s break out from the Bull Flag pattern, an indicator that typically signals the start of an upward price movement. Shiba Inu Breakout To Trigger A Continuation 210% Price Increase Mark’s emphasis delves into the current bullish momentum surrounding Shiba Inu, which has caused traders and investors in the meme coin market to feel optimistic once again, indicating that the crypto asset could be positioned for more gains. Related Reading If This Happens, Shiba Inu Price Could Double Soon 1 day ago According to the expert, SHIB has now exited a smaller Bull Flag-like pattern, and it is currently holding above it. This breakout appears to be significant as Javon Marks noted that it could start another major wave in an already enormous run on the upside. SHIB breakout from bull flag-like pattern | Source: Javon Marks on X Specifically, this lesser break can trigger a continuation in an over 210% (3X) run to $0.000081 from the $0.0000254 level, provided that the larger breakout also holds. In addition, should Shiba Inu surpass the $0.000081 level, it might be poised for an additional 90% increase to the $0.0001553 mark. The post read: With a larger breakout also holding, this smaller break can initiate a continuation in an over 210% run to the $0.000081 target which is more than 3X from here. A break above $0.000081 and SHIB may just be set for another +90% move to $0.0001553. The analyst further drew attention to his previous forecasts, in which he predicted a run to the $0.000081 price level. He previously noted that Shiba Inu has made a strong comeback and appears to be primed for yet another huge surge towards the $0.000081 target. Thus, given the progressive breakout from the resisting trend, another 141% upside move to hit the aforementioned price target may not be far off. Also, following price declines, SHIB will garner strength to reach the level and move even higher to $0.0001553. Pullbacks To Buttress The Move Javon Mark affirms that since SHIB’s break out from the resisting trend, it has increased by over 129%, suggesting that a run is well within reach. At this point, Marks claims that as long as current prices maintain their breakout, pullbacks might only enhance these prices. Additionally, an extra 252% price increase toward $0.000081 will be aided by these pullbacks. Related Reading Shiba Inu Price Makes Decisive Move: Is Now The Ideal Time To Buy? 5 days ago It is important to note that the analyst’s prediction began when SHIB ended a 441-day downtrend in September last year. Given the significance of the development, Marks believed SHIB was about to surge, putting his target at $0.000081, a 975% rise from $0.0000074. As of the time of writing, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.0000257, demonstrating over 6% growth in the past day. Both its market cap and trading volume have also attracted significant gains of about 6.83% and 147%, respectively.

Recent developments in institutional adoption provide further support for this positive trajectory. Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital and a notable Bitcoin advocate, recently discussed on CNBC’s Squawk Box how US pension funds are beginning to invest in BTC. “When you do the homework on Bitcoin, you go towards Bitcoin…sometimes when you’re early you get some bumps and scrapes, but I think it pays to be early in Bitcoin and we are still early in Bitcoin,” says SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci. pic.twitter.com/HTfbwH5VJG — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) May 16, 2024 This move by institutional investors, such as the State of Wisconsin Investment Board’s approximately $100 million investment in BTC, signals a broader acceptance and integration of BTC into traditional financial portfolios. Scaramucci emphasized that institutional BTC adoption is unfolding rapidly, and he anticipates more pension funds will pursue Bitcoin investments. He pointed out that regulatory approvals have opened the doors for large-scale institutional participation in BTC. This endorsement will make Bitcoin a staple in these institutions’ long-term asset allocation strategies. According to Scaramucci, understanding Bitcoin and the history of money is key to recognizing its potential.

    "content": "Uniswap Labs, the creator of one of the largest decentralized trading platforms, is challenging a potential enforcement action by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing that crypto tokens should not be classified as securities. The New York-based firm recently refuted the allegation that it operated as an unregistered exchange and broker-dealer. This response follows the SEC’s issuance of a Wells Notice to Uniswap Labs, signaling its intent to recommend legal action against the company. Uniswap Labs Challenges SEC’s Claims In a 40-page filing submitted to the SEC, Uniswap Labs outlined numerous reasons why the agency’s pursuit of legal action should be reconsidered. The SEC’s claims are primarily based on the assumption that all tokens are securities, a premise that Uniswap Labs disputes. Related Reading Institutional Investors Pour $942 Million Into Bitcoin, Will This Trigger A Rally To $80,000? 15 hours ago Marvin Ammori, Chief Legal Officer of Uniswap Labs, emphasized that tokens are merely a file format for value and not inherently securities. He criticized the SEC’s attempt to redefine the terms “exchange,” “broker,” and “investment contract” to encompass Uniswap’s operations. This year, the SEC has taken action against numerous crypto firms through Wells notices, lawsuits, or settlements. The commission’s scrutiny has increasingly focused on Ethereum and decentralized finance players, including Uniswap, ShapeShift, TradeStation, and Consensys. Additionally, reports suggest that the Ethereum Foundation is under investigation. Distinction Between Tokens And Securities Uniswap Labs believes that the SEC’s case against them is flawed. It fails to recognize the distinction between tokens as files for value and tokens as securities. If the SEC proceeds with a lawsuit accusing Uniswap Labs of operating as an unregistered exchange, it risks facing adverse consequences regarding its authority over crypto tokens. Uniswap Labs warned that such litigation could set a precedent undermining the SEC’s ongoing rulemaking efforts. The company expressed its willingness to litigate if necessary and expressed confidence in a favorable outcome, stating: But we’re prepared to fight. Our lawyers are 2-0 in high-profile SEC cases. Andrew Ceresney, a former head of enforcement at the SEC, represented Ripple in their victory over the SEC. Don Verrilli, a former U.S. solicitor general, has argued more than 50 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and represented Grayscale in its successful case against the SEC. Related Reading Why Is The Ethereum Price Up 20% Today? 18 hours ago SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has consistently maintained that decentralized exchanges are not genuinely decentralized and should fall under the regulator’s purview. Gensler has also argued that many digital assets qualify as unregistered securities subject to SEC regulations. Uniswap Labs, in its response, contended that its governance token, UNI, does not meet the requirements of the Howey Test, a legal framework used to evaluate investment contracts. The company also disputed the SEC’s classification of LP tokens, which are used as securities for liquidity provision in Uniswap pools. Uniswap Labs asserted that LP tokens are accounting tools rather than investment instruments. Uniswap’s native token UNI has seen significant gains of nearly 20% in the last 24 hours alone, as the market rebounded from a two-month consolidation period to trade at $9.34.

    "content": "The crypto industry has seen a positive shift with the recent market recovery. After a Q1 full of bullish sentiment, Q2 saw many sectors of the crypto space brewing a pessimistic feeling toward altcoins. Related Reading Why Is The Ethereum Price Up 20% Today? 18 hours ago Experts and market watchers have reassured investors that the price corrections were part of the cycle, predicting that the bullish rally would resume after the cool-off. Now, analysts consider that altcoins are about to embark on a “massive leg higher” for the alt season. Ethereum’s Surge Refuels Sentiment The crypto market is up by 8.3%, with a market capitalization of $2.55 trillion. This market surge has seen Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, soar past $70,000 in the last day. Similarly, the “king of altcoins” remarkably performed these past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH)’s price has risen 22% since yesterday, surpassing levels not seen since mid-March. However, ETH is yet to test its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, set nearly two years ago. As a result, the second-largest cryptocurrency has been criticized this cycle for being “a major disappointment.” In a turn of events, rumors of an approval of ETH spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have refueled investors’ bullish tank, “erasing 65 days of down only” with a single daily candle. As ETH rallies, analysts believe it’s only a matter of time before the whole altcoins sector surges to kick off the altcoin season. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted the ‘Crypto Money Flow Cycle’, stating that, now that BTC and ETH have rallied, “it’s time for Altcoins to rally.” Is The Altcoins Season Here? During the slowdowns, market watchers have analyzed altcoins’ run this cycle. Altcoin Sherpa has stated that many tokens didn’t “run that hard” during round 1 of the bull run, resulting in his forecast of a 1-4 months “cool-off” period before resuming the uptrend. Despite the similarities with previous bull runs, the singularities of this cycle, like the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the Memecoin pre-sale frenzy, have made investors question whether they would see the alt season this time. Nonetheless, several analysts, who urged investors not to panic before, suggest the community prepares for the “maniac phase” ahead.

To crypto Yoddha, “we’re looking at the bullish continuation” that will lead to a new market ATH during round 2. Similarly, Top analyst Michaël van de Poppe, who recently sold all his BTC for Altcoins, stated that the Altcoin market capitalization has finished its correction: The next step: reaching all-time high, which is ~60-70% from here. I think #Ethereum is likely reaching that in the next 2-4 months.

    "content": "Blockchain technology makes scientific research more transparent, fair, and community-oriented by decentralizing control and advancing access to global knowledge. The academic publishing industry is grappling with numerous challenges that obstruct the free flow of knowledge and the fair recognition of scholarly work. At the core, inefficiencies in the publishing process, high publication costs and discriminatory practices stand out as major hurdles. These issues create an environment where researchers from underprivileged backgrounds or less renowned institutions struggle to get their work published and recognized. In this context, the need for a meritocratic system that recognizes and rewards scientific work based on its quality rather than the financial or institutional power behind it becomes crucial. One of the most pressing issues is the high cost associated with publishing, known as article processing charges (APCs), which can amount to thousands of dollars for top-tier journals. At present, Nature Communications, known for its high impact and prestige, charges around $6,800 to cover publication costs for all accepted research articles. Furthermore, publishers like PLoS ONE and BioMed Central can charge between $1,500 and $6,000. This amount can pose a financial barrier, limiting access for researchers from less affluent institutions and countries to publish in prestigious journals and gain recognition for their scientific achievements. Submission process of a traditional journal with peer review. Source: Researcher Connect Moreover, the traditional peer review system, while foundational for maintaining the quality and integrity of published research, is often criticized for its lack of transparency and potential for bias. Issues such as delayed reviews and reviewers’ anonymity can sometimes contribute to unjust rejections or underestimate the significance of the research. Blockchain as a Solution for Academic Publishing Challenges Blockchain technology, best known for its role in cryptocurrency, offers a promising solution to several systemic issues plaguing the academic publishing industry. Its fundamental features —decentralization, transparency and security— align well with the need for more equitable and efficient publishing practices. Blockchain introduces a decentralized model where research can be published and accessed on a distributed ledger. This model reduces the influence of any single reviewer or editor, thereby diminishing potential biases in the selection and review processes. Also, the transparency inherent in blockchain technology can be leveraged to make the peer review process more open and fair. Every transaction on a blockchain is recorded on an immutable and time-stamped public ledger. Applying this to academic publishing means that submissions, decisions, and reviews can be traced and verified, which discourages misconduct and enhances trust in the published material. Another significant advantage of using blockchain is the security and permanence it offers. Once information is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, which ensures the permanent record of scientific discoveries. This feature is particularly crucial in a landscape where retractions and modifications of published research are concerns. NobleBlocks: Implementing Blockchain in Academic Publishing As a decentralized science (DeSci) platform, NobleBlocks emerges as a transformative solution to the fundamental problems within the academic publishing sector. The platform initiates change by addressing the inefficiencies, high costs and biases that often obstruct equitable access to scholarly communication. Benefiting from blockchain technology, NobleBlocks addresses imbalances in academic publishing. Source: NobleBlocks By integrating blockchain technology, NobleBlocks introduces a decentralized publishing framework that significantly reduces the influence of any centralized authority, such as traditional publishers or editorial boards. This structure allows researchers from various backgrounds, regardless of their institutional affiliation or geographical location, to publish their work without discrimination based on their less renowned status or lack of connections. A pivotal feature of NobleBlocks is its emphasis on transparency and security. Every transaction, including manuscript submissions, peer reviews and editorial decisions, is recorded on an immutable blockchain. In other words, the entire process is traceable and secure, which not only enhances trust in the published material but also protects the integrity of scientific discoveries. The platform employs a tokenized system instead of conventional fees. Authors, reviewers, and editors use and earn tokens for their contributions, which can also be traded within the platform. NobleBlocks’ streamlined process enables faster publication times than conventional journals. By leveraging blockchain technology and automated workflows, the platform allows for quicker peer review and editorial decisions. This efficient, user-friendly system ensures that research findings are disseminated significantly faster. Overall, NobleBlocks leverages blockchain’s robust features to offer a more open, fair, and cost-effective platform for academic publishing. The platform ensures that scientific insights are accessible and available to share, fostering a more inclusive scientific community. This innovative approach will not only raise the bar for academic publishing but also remove barriers that would otherwise limit the democratization of knowledge.\n\n",

Additionally, UXLINK’s first-season airdrop is in progress, targeting the top 10% of users and surpassing a scale of 550,000.” What is the narrative behind UXLINK’s product and ecosystem? “UXLINK is dedicated to leading an integrated social ecosystem aimed at channeling Web3 traffic, social trading, and infrastructure,” Yinghao shared. “The product ecosystem is structured into three distinct layers: Application Layer: This layer encompasses UX Discover and Social DEX, facilitating users in social discovery, participation, and investment within group contexts. It also empowers third-party developers to craft diverse applications tailored to user preferences. Protocol Layer: At the core of UXLINK’s architecture lies its protocol layer, housing social protocols grounded in real-world relationships. This framework grants users true ownership over their social connections and data. Developers leverage these protocols to deliver personalized user experiences, including AI-driven algorithms, recommendations, and group formations. By addressing the challenge of data silos prevalent in the Web3 landscape, social data becomes a potent resource for innovation. Social Liquidity Layer (Planned): The forthcoming Social Liquidity Layer aims to establish a user-centric infrastructure that tokenizes social relationships and data assets. This layer facilitates their seamless transfer across various public chains and DApps in a secure manner. Both the Protocol and Social Liquidity layers serve as robust infrastructure for developers, offering unique opportunities for innovation and user engagement.” Product architecture diagram: How does UXLINK approach authentic socialization and trusted networks? “UXLINK embodies a shift towards genuine social connections and experiences, coupled with innovation in Web3 fundamentals,” Yinghao stated. “At the heart of UXLINK is a focus on authentic interpersonal relationships that mirror real-life social dynamics. Trust, established through direct or indirect endorsements, is crucial for actions like recommendations and transactions. UXLINK’s architecture is designed to harness the power of genuine socialization, essentially functioning as a sophisticated data production machine. This generates various types of data, ranging from basic acquaintance connections to more intricate associations such as person-group, person-network, person-project, and person-asset relationships.” What are UXLINK’s strategies for assets and finance in the Web3 landscape? “UXLINK focuses on activating existing asset trading, facilitating the issuance and circulation of new assets, and accommodating different types of assets,” Yinghao elaborated. “By transforming personal relationships into valuable network assets, UXLINK increases the turnover frequency of assets and supports the issuance of new assets with new narratives and standards. On the financial side, UXLINK ensures that users directly benefit from their contributions to the ecosystem, promoting a sustainable and engaging environment.” How does UXLINK function as a connector in the Web3 ecosystem? “UXLINK serves as a super-connector, acting as a central hub between two interconnected closed loops,” Yinghao explained. “Firstly, it links users, products, and developers, addressing core needs and fostering a robust user-product community. Secondly, it bridges infrastructure, traffic, and applications, enhancing cohesion and collaboration in the fragmented Web3 landscape.” What advantages does UXLINK’s team bring to the table? “The UXLINK team epitomizes the configuration of a typical S-tier founder leading an S-tier team,” Yinghao highlighted. “With several years of entrepreneurial experience in the internet industry, the team possesses exceptional expertise in product research and development, growth strategies, operations, and fundraising. Their commitment to first principles ensures a robust product-market fit, starting from actual user needs and integrating Web3 concepts effectively.” What potential does UXLINK hold for establishing core resources in Web3? “As the pioneer of Web3 social products deeply rooted in personal relationships, UXLINK is rapidly constructing personal networks and achieving a phase of leadership,” Yinghao emphasized. “The platform’s objective monopoly on personal networks extends to defining scenarios and pricing resources, reinforcing its dominance in the Web3 space. The self-reinforcing networks of acquaintances and brands further enhance its value.” How does UXLINK balance purist and pragmatist approaches in Web3? “UXLINK’s approach of ’embracing both sides’ offers a promising middle ground between decentralization and user experience,” Yinghao concluded. “By integrating decentralization with user-friendly incentives, UXLINK aims to create a more balanced and user-friendly Web3 ecosystem. This approach bridges the gap between purist and pragmatist developers, fostering sustainable and widely adopted applications.” In summary, Yinghao’s insights reveal UXLINK’s thoughtful balance between idealism and practicality in Web3, creating meaningful value for developers and users alike. SevenX Ventures is confident in UXLINK’s potential to become a key hub linking Web3 infrastructure and application scenarios.\n\n",

    "content": "Institutional investors are doubling their bets on Bitcoin, with investment funds related to the flagship crypto recording massive inflows last week. This development signals a bullish sentiment among these investors which could trigger a Bitcoin rally to $80,000. Bitcoin Investment Funds Record $942 Million In Inflows According to CoinShares’ latest weekly report, Bitcoin investment products recorded a net inflow of $942 million. These inflows are said to have been “an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report on Wednesday,” with 89% of the total flows coming in the latter three trading days of last week. Related Reading Crypto Analyst Sounds Warning Alarm For Potential 50-60% Crash In Chainlink Price, Here’s Why 1 day ago The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data, which came in lower than expected, is believed to have restored investors’ confidence in the market. The data showed that inflation in the US may be slowing, raising the prospect of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. Lower interest rates are good for the crypto market since they will make investors more willing to invest in risk assets like Bitcoin. The US accounted for most of the inflows into BTC, with $1 billion flowing into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs last week. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has recorded over $16 billion in outflows since the ETF approval in January, also saw inflows (for the first time) of $18 million last week. This trend of significant inflows into these Spot Bitcoin ETFs likely continues this week. Farside investors revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that these funds recorded a net inflow of $237.2 million on May 20. Interestingly, none of these Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows on the day, with GBTC recording an inflow of $9.3 million. It is also worth noting that while BTC saw inflows of $942 million, there were almost no flows into short Bitcoin, with CoinShares noting that this implies a positive outlook amongst investors. Altcoins like Solana, Chainlink, and Cardano also recorded considerable inflows, with $4.9 million, $3.7 million, and $1.9 million flowing into these crypto tokens, respectively. BTC’s Bull Run Might Be Back On With the Spot Bitcoin ETFs again seeing impressive demand and recording significant inflows, there is a feeling that Bitcoin’s bull run might be in full force. These investment funds were known to have contributed significantly to the flagship crypto’s hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,750 in March.

Besides the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, other factors contribute to a bullish continuation for BTC. One is the macroeconomic data, which shows that the economic situation in the US could be improving. Meanwhile, from a technical analysis perspective, the worst looks over for Bitcoin with crypto analyst Rekt Capital, revealing that the crypto token has left the post-halving danger zone.

Related Reading Unstoppable Bitcoin? CryptoQuant’s CEO Foresees Bull Run Extending To 2025 4 days ago Bitcoin’s Path Analyzed: What’s Coming? Crypto analyst Rekt Capital earlier today highlighted on the X platform that a weekly candle close above approximately $71,500 could potentially initiate a breakout from the current “Re-Accumulation Range.” However, the analysts disclosed that history suggests that Bitcoin may need to consolidate within this range for several more weeks to align more closely with historical Halving Cycles, which have previously influenced its price trajectory. #BTC A Weekly Candle Close above ~$71500 would probably kickstart the breakout from the Re-Accumulation Range However, history suggests Bitcoin should consolidate inside this Re-Accumulation Range for several weeks more Extended consolidation here would get Bitcoin closer to… pic.twitter.com/Af0W4MMBTN — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 21, 2024 This extended consolidation period, as highlighted by the analyst, could benefit Bitcoin’s long-term growth. Particularly, it could help the cryptocurrency “resynchronize” with previous cycles, potentially leading to a longer and more sustained bull run, as opposed to a shorter, more accelerated cycle that peaks sooner. Rekt Capital noted: After all, the current acceleration in the cycle is still around 190 days (which is an improvement from the 260-day acceleration set in mid-March when BTC made new All Time Highs) The analyst pointed out that while both scenarios are bullish, the preference between a shorter or a typically longer bull run remains a matter of market speculation. Currently, the discussion revolves around whether Bitcoin can continue to defy historical trends with a break above the $71,500 range. BTC price is moving sideways on the 2-hour chart.

Back then, Bitcoin saw a significant rise, recording a 1,200% increase on its way to the previous high of $20,000. TechDev’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin could be setting up for another parabolic rise, potentially reaching as high as $100,000, especially given its longer consolidation period in the current market cycle compared to 2017. Supporting this viewpoint, RektCapital hinted that even a price of $72,000 would seem modest in the coming months if Bitcoin continues on its projected path. #BTC Even $72000 will be a low price for Bitcoin, months from now$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 20, 2024 Notably, the surge in Bitcoin’s price recorded so far is influenced by a mix of optimism and anticipation surrounding the potential approval of Ethereum spot ETFs and increasing inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs.

    "content": "Zeebu, the industry-leading payments and settlement platform, has reached a new milestone, surpassing $2 billion in total settlement volume, a testament to the platform’s robust growth and strategic positioning within the telecom and Web3 payments sector. The growth of Zeebu must be contextualized within the broader expansion of the blockchain-based transaction space, where it is not only participating but leading the charge. In just a few months following the launch of Zeebu’s on-chain settlement platform, the company impressively managed to settle thousands of invoices, rapidly progressing from an initial $1 billion to now surpassing $2 billion in transactions. This growth underscores the platform’s scalability and the robust demand for its services. Zeebu has become a pivotal player in blockchain-based settlements for the telecom sector, offering an instant payment and settlement solution that significantly reduces transaction times from days to minutes and cuts out intermediaries through the use of smart contract technology. The core of Zeebu’s innovation is the ZBU Token, which not only facilitates global transactions but also enhances participant engagement through a loyalty and rewards system. This tokenization strategy effectively tackles common financial hurdles like high fees, delays in remittance, and issues with currency exchange, making it an ideal solution for cross-border settlements. The platform’s usage has expanded substantially, with a growing number of telecom carriers and businesses leveraging Zeebu’s capabilities. As the platform evolves, Zeebu continues to attract new users who recognize its benefits, reinforcing its position as a trusted and leading payment platform in the market. The data from Zeebu’s dashboard reveals that the overall transaction volume on the platform has already crossed over $2 Billion. At the time of writing, the number of invoices settled stands at 32k+, with total users around 465. Some of the company’s achievements this year included two massive token burn events and participation in leading telecom and Web3 events across the globe. The first token burn occurred in February 2024, removing over 236 million ZBU tokens from circulation, accounting for more than 4.7% of the total supply. The second burn took place in May 2024, removing an additional 239 million ZBU tokens, reinforcing Zeebu’s commitment to a sustainable token ecosystem through its Phoenix Protocol, which automates and governs the burn process to ensure a balanced token supply. In addition to these token burns, Zeebu has actively expanded its presence by participating in and sponsoring major telecom and Web3 events across the Middle East, the Americas, and other regions. This strategic involvement has helped Zeebu establish a strong foothold in these markets and increase its brand visibility. To further raise awareness about Zeebu, the company partnered with CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko to host several campaigns. These efforts, coupled with listings on prominent exchanges, have significantly enhanced Zeebu’s market presence and credibility. Moreover, Zeebu released a major update to its Payment Service Provider (PSP) platform, introducing governance features that enable telecom merchants to transition from passive users to active participants in the ecosystem. This update enhances the overall user experience and fosters a more engaged community within the Zeebu platform. Raj Brahmbhatt, Founder and CEO of Zeebu, added, “This milestone is a significant leap forward in our journey, clearly aligning with our broader strategic goals. As the telecom industry increasingly embraces innovative payment solutions such as blockchain, our extensive experience and proven ability to provide exceptional user experiences and customized financial solutions uniquely position us to meet the growing demands of this dynamic sector.” Looking ahead, Zeebu is set to further enhance its services, expand its ecosystem, and transition towards a more decentralized and community-driven governance model.

Bitcoin Has Been Reacting To Binance/Coinbase Volume Changes In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the dynamics in the cryptocurrency market that arise out of the battle happening between Binance and Coinbase for spot volume dominance. Related Reading Newbie Bitcoin Whales Buying 200,000 BTC Per Week, Data Shows 1 week ago The quant shared a chart below that shows how this war for dominance has played out over the past decade. The spot volume share of the two giant exchanges | Source: CryptoQuant As the graph shows, Binance has been the much more dominant of the two platforms when considering the spot volume. The exchange is hosting five times as much volume as Coinbase. The analyst notes that the difference between the two would be even higher when considering the BTC-FDUSD pair, which isn’t included in the data depicted in the above chart. Despite the much lower spot volume, Coinbase still hasn’t been irrelevant in the market. For example, the platform is the custodian for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC. There also appears to be an interesting pattern between the dominance of the American exchange and the Bitcoin spot price. The quant has highlighted this trend in the graph. There have been a few instances where a rise in the spot trading volume of Coinbase against Binance has preceded surges in the value of cryptocurrency. Similarly, declines in the platform’s dominance have seemingly led to drawdowns in the Bitcoin price. The analyst has also discussed the trend in the volumes of the two exchanges more closely, using the spot volume ratio for them, as shown below. The value of the metric seems to have been relatively low in recent months | Source: CryptoQuant The chart shows that the spot volume ratio between Binance and Coinbase had spiked to very high levels in 2023, with the former’s volume being 53 times the latter’s. The reason behind this was the zero-fee scheme that Binance had introduced for the Bitcoin trading pairs. However, Coinbase’s volume has recently risen, although the ratio remains notably in favor of Binance. This shift in the market emerged as the Bitcoin spot ETF-related news started to intensify.

    "content": "Cardano (ADA), the native token of the smart contracts platform, has been a hot topic in crypto circles this week. The surge in price and trading activity has analysts like Sssebi predicting a potential bull run for ADA, citing key technical indicators and a shift in market sentiment. Related Reading Solana Leaves Competition In The Dust: Blazing Speed To Fuel Price Surge? 1 day ago Breaking Through Resistance, Bouncing Back Stronger Sssebi, a well-respected crypto analyst, recently published a detailed report highlighting ADA’s recent bullish behavior. One of the key factors Sssebi points to is the token’s successful climb above the crucial 200-day moving average (200MA) on the 4-hour chart. The 200MA is a widely used technical indicator that reflects the long-term trend of an asset. Traditionally, a price moving above the 200MA is seen as a bullish signal, suggesting a potential shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. $ADA gets a nice bounce of the 200MA on the 4hr chart with increased volume! Bullish! Since it hit 0.80$ $ADA was not able to get above this moving average and now it has broken it, came back and retested and bounced with high volume! Insanely bullish on $ADA right now! https://t.co/YCcGY13ZSp pic.twitter.com/QyatkiCx4k — Sssebi? (@Av_Sebastian) May 21, 2024 But Sssebi’s analysis goes beyond the initial breakout. He emphasizes the significance of the retest and subsequent bounce back from the 200MA with high trading volume. This price action, according to Sssebi, suggests a robust buying force behind ADA. The previous resistance level, once a hurdle for further gains, may now act as a strong support floor, preventing sharp price drops. Volume Surge Fuels Optimism Another key element in Sssebi’s bullish outlook is the significant increase in trading volume accompanying ADA’s recent price rise. Trading volume is a crucial indicator of market interest and investor sentiment. High volume suggests a larger number of market participants are actively involved in buying and selling ADA, lending credence to the price movement. In the case of ADA, the high volume surge alongside the bounce off the 200MA strengthens Sssebi’s belief in a potential uptrend. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView The analyst’s insights have resonated with the crypto community, with many traders and investors keeping a close eye on Cardano’s developments. Sssebi’s bullish view is primarily based on technical indicators and recent market activity, suggesting the possibility of further price appreciation for ADA. However, the article published by Sssebi also underscores the importance of conducting independent research before making any investment decisions. Related Reading XRP: Social Buzz Points To $0.70, But Technicals Predict Dip To $0.50 First 1 day ago Cardano: Fundamentals And Ecosystem Growth While Sssebi’s analysis paints a promising technical picture for ADA, the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory will likely depend on a broader set of factors. Cardano’s development team, Input Output Global (IOG), has been diligently working on scaling solutions and expanding the platform’s capabilities. The successful launch of smart contracts last year marked a significant milestone, and upcoming developments like the Vasil Hard Fork, aimed at improving network scalability and transaction fees, are eagerly awaited by the community.

    "content": "Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of blockchain technology firm Consensys, has expressed that the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could lead to significant supply constraints for Ether. This development is anticipated to be a “watershed” moment for Ethereum. In an exclusive interview with DL News, Lubin predicted that the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs will unlock substantial institutional demand. Given that many institutions have begun their crypto investments with spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum is naturally the next substantial asset for diversification. “There’s going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether” through these ETFs, Lubin commented. However, he also noted that the situation for Ethereum differs significantly from that of Bitcoin because of the underlying supply dynamics. A major factor distinguishing Ethereum from Bitcoin in the context of ETF creation is the availability of the assets. On-chain data indicates that more than 27% of all Ether is staked across various protocols on the Ethereum network. These funds are locked in contracts and are contributing to the network’s security and operations, thus they are not readily available for market trading. “Much of the Ether is put to work in the core protocol, DeFi systems, or in DAOs,” Lubin explained. This structural difference means that there is less Ether available for ETF providers to purchase and allocate to new ETF shares. Related Reading Ethereum Soars 20%: ETH Hype Escalates on ETF Rumors 1 day ago In August 2021, the Ethereum network’s EIP 1559 introduced a burning mechanism where a portion of the Ether used for transaction fees is permanently removed from circulation. This deflationary mechanism is designed to balance Ether supply growth and potentially increase its scarcity over time. As network activity increases—potentially spurred further by new institutional interest in Ethereum through ETFs—this burn mechanism will gradually reduce the available supply, adding another layer to the potential supply crunch. “This could be a pretty profound watershed moment”, Lubin said. Ethereum Price Targets And Doubts The market impact of an approved Ethereum spot ETF could be significant. Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher projected a possible scenario where Ethereum could see a price surge similar to that experienced by Bitcoin following its own ETF approval. According to Deutscher’s analysis, “BTC rallied 75% in 63 days after the spot ETF was approved. If ETH follows the same trend (if approved), this would take it to $6,446 by July 23.” $BTC rallied 75% in 63 days after the spot ETF was approved. If $ETH follows the same trend (if approved), this would take it to $6,446 by July 23. pic.twitter.com/FfWg9VGUMx — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) May 21, 2024 However, opinions among analysts vary. Vetle Lunde from K33 Research pointed out the challenges in replicating Bitcoin’s success, noting that the futures-based Ethereum ETFs have only captured a small fraction of the assets compared to their Bitcoin counterparts prior to spot ETF approval. “Fut-based ETH ETFs have seen cumulative net inflows of $126m since launch ~ roughly equivalent to the inflow to BITX over the past 3 days. Fut-based ETH ETFs aggregated AUM is only 7.4% of the AUM fut-based BTC ETFs had before the spot approval,” he remarked. Related Reading Crypto Market Liquidations Top $330 Million In 24 Hours With Ethereum In The Lead 21 hours ago Meanwhile, crypto analyst Vijay Boyapati raised concerns about the structural differences in ETFs, specifically the inability of ETF structures to incorporate staking. “It should be noted that the ETH ETFs, if approved, will be a much worse proxy for the underlying asset than BTC ETFs because the SEC is still extremely unlikely to allow the ETF applicants to stake,” he said. This could result in the ETFs not fully reflecting the underlying value growth of Ethereum price, as also highlighted by Alex Thorn, Head of Research at crypto-focused financial services firm Galaxy commented: “Lack of staking in ETH ETPs would be material for returns. If u bought $10k ETH on Merge day in Sep ‘22 and held until today without staking it, you underperformed by 8% over that period vs someone who bought and staked to collect issuance, tips, and MEV.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,759.

    "content": "In a recent security incident, Gala Games, a Web3 gaming company, fell victim to an exploit that led to the unauthorized minting of 5 billion tokens, equivalent to approximately $214 million. The hacker behind the breach subsequently sold 592 million GALA tokens, amounting to $21.8 million in value, as blockchain analysis firm Lookonchain confirmed. CEO Of Gala Games Takes Responsibility For Breach Gala Games responded to the breach, assuring the community via social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the security incident involving the GALA token had been contained and that the affected wallet had been frozen. The company acknowledged the isolated nature of the incident and stated that it had addressed the cause while collaborating closely with law enforcement agencies to investigate the individuals responsible for the breach. Related Reading Crypto Market Liquidations Top $330 Million In 24 Hours With Ethereum In The Lead 21 hours ago Eric Schiermeyer, CEO of Gala Games, expressed his regret over the incident, referencing his previous stance on projects experiencing hacks. Schiermeyer disclosed that the breach led to the unauthorized sale of 600 million GALA tokens, equivalent to $21 million, and the subsequent burning of 4.4 billion tokens. Within 45 minutes, Gala Games identified the compromise and effectively secured and removed unauthorized access to the GALA contract. Reassuring stakeholders, Schiermeyer emphasized that the Ethereum (ETH) contract for GALA remained secure and protected by a multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet, with no compromise detected. Acknowledging internal control shortcomings, Schiermeyer also admitted responsibility for the incident and outlined the steps being taken to prevent its recurrence. Gala Games expressed confidence in identifying the culprit behind the breach. They confirmed active collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and a network of international authorities to ensure appropriate legal actions are pursued. The incident raised concerns regarding the project’s daily distribution, prompting Gala Games to propose a node vote to address the issue. As per their community-driven approach, the decision on how to proceed will be determined by the community itself. DFW Labs Support In response to the incident, DFW Labs, a Web3 investor and market maker, took action to alleviate selling pressure in the market. They purchased 28 million GALA tokens from the open market to stabilize the value of the token, which had fallen to $0.037 on Monday following the exploit. However, with the investment from DFW Labs, the token rebounded to its current trading price of $0.0431, representing a loss of 7.8% in the last 24 hours.

    "content": "The crypto market is witnessing increased interest as several currencies demonstrate remarkable growth potential. Amid the anticipation of the impending bull run, many potential investors are trying to pinpoint the best possible tokens to add to their portfolio and maximize their investment. Among these, Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), and WienerAI ($WAI) stand out due to their solid foundations and promising prospects. These currencies have captured the attention of investors seeking promising meme coins that could deliver gains in the 100x range in the near future. Numerous experts and seasoned analysts are positive that Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), and WienerAI ($WAI) offer the greatest potential to skyrocket and bring exponential gains to early investors! Let’s go through all the essential details and see what these tokens have to offer! \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy the Best Meme Coin Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) is the Hottest Multi-Chain Presale Token Already Raising Over $15 Million Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain cryptocurrency, has made a notable entrance into the crypto market with a successful presale that has raised over $15 million. This impressive achievement highlights the significant investor interest and market potential of the project. At the core of Dogeverse is Cosmo, a versatile doge character designed to enhance accessibility and adaptability across multiple blockchains. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that operate on a single blockchain, Dogeverse seamlessly functions across six blockchains, including Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Base, Solana, and BNB Chain. This flexibility enables efficient transactions with reduced fees, making it an attractive option for users seeking cost-effective solutions. The project’s structure is robust, boasting a total supply of 200 billion tokens, with 30 billion tokens available during the ongoing presale period. Additionally, 25% of the token supply is allocated for marketing efforts, underscoring the project’s commitment to gaining widespread visibility and adoption. Dogeverse’s uniqueness lies in its approach, drawing inspiration from Dogecoin while introducing notable improvements to stand out in the crowded cryptocurrency space. Its adaptability across multiple ecosystems expands its potential user base and integration opportunities, further enhancing its utility. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Dogeverse Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sealana ($SEAL) is one of the Newest Additions to the Solana Network Drawing Inspiration from the Popular South Park Character Sealana ($SEAL) has emerged as a captivating meme coin sensation within the Solana ecosystem. Despite having no defined utility, its novel concept and community-driven approach have captured the imaginations of both low and high-risk investors. The project’s novelty revolves around a quirky seal character, a redneck American seal, who dives deep into the Solana sea in search of the next big crypto opportunity. This comedic premise, coupled with cultural references, elevates Sealana beyond a mere meme coin, positioning it as a cultural phenomenon. One of Sealana’s key attractions is its innovative airdrop model. Unlike traditional presales with predetermined price tiers, investors can send $SOL tokens to a designated wallet address and receive an airdrop of Sealana tokens directly after the presale concludes. For each $SOL deposited, the project airdrops 6,449 $SEAL tokens, a simplicity that has contributed to the project’s viral success. Sealana’s presale has already garnered significant traction, raising over $1.2 million within the first few weeks. This achievement has caught the attention of reputable crypto analysts, with some speculating that Sealana could replicate the success of other meme coin projects within the Solana ecosystem. While Sealana’s lack of defined utility relies primarily on speculative demand, the project’s offbeat concept and community enthusiasm have made it a notable contender in the meme coin space, particularly as anticipation builds for a potential Solana bull run. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sealana Now\u003c\u003c\u003c WienerAI ($WAI) is Introducing a Cutting Edge AI-Trading Bot WienerAI ($WAI) is a unique offering in the cryptocurrency space, combining the appeal of meme coins with the innovative potential of artificial intelligence. While drawing inspiration from popular dog-themed tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, WienerAI aims to present a more approachable and personable aspect of AI technology. One of the standout features of WienerAI is its exclusive presale, which offers deeply discounted $WAI tokens and daily staking rewards. The presale is structured in tiers, with token prices increasing as certain funding milestones are met, creating a sense of urgency for early investors. Currently, stakers can earn an annual percentage yield (APY) of around 577%, though this rate is designed to decrease as more investors join. WienerAI ($WAI) has already generated significant interest, raising over $350,000 on its first day of presale. The project has launched without a hard cap, and 30% of its 69 billion total token supply is dedicated to the presale. However, the project goes beyond mere novelty by incorporating an AI-powered trading bot that promises to elevate trading experiences. This innovative bot aims to streamline swapping processes, provide responsive query handling, and offer MEV protection, all without encountering additional fees for users. This structure, combined with the innovative blend of memetics and technology, positions WienerAI as a potential high-growth opportunity. Moreover, WienerAI is built on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token, boasting infinite upgradeability. This means that the project is not just a static meme coin but a constantly evolving AI initiative at the forefront of innovation, providing added value to investors beyond pure speculation. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy WienerAI Now\u003c\u003c\u003c The Final Words At the end of the day, the crypto world is a wild ride, and meme coins are often the thrill-seekers of this digital frontier. On top of that, amongst so many choices it can be hard to pinpoint the best option to add to your portfolios. That’s why through thorough research many experts and seasoned analysts are all pointing in the direction of these tokens Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), and WienerAI ($WAI) as they show great potential to skyrocket and bring gains up to 100x. Whether you’re a risk-taker or a cautious observer, it’s hard to ignore the buzz surrounding these tokens. Act now, before some of these tokens conclude their presale stage and the prices go up in the near future!\n\n",

    "content": "As the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices hav barreled toward a new all-time high, short-term traders have been suffering the brunt of the liquidations. In the last day alone, over $330 million was liquidated from the crypto market and the majority of this has been from short traders who expect prices to fall once again. Over 78,000 Traders Liquidated For $330 Million Coinglass data shows that the last 24 hours have been brutal for crypto traders. In this short time, more than 78,000 crypto traders have seen their positions liquidated, leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Related Reading Bitcoin Retail Investors Are Dumping Amid Jump To $67,000, Why This Is Good For Price 1 day ago In total, there have been $330 million in liquidations. Out of this figure, 81.42% were positions belonging to short traders, meaning they made up $268.76 million of the total figure. Long traders only made up $61.31 million in the liquidations. Source: Coinglass Contrary to the established trend, Bitcoin did not lead liquidations this time around, instead falling behind Ethereum. This is understandable as the Ethereum price had risen over 20% in the 24-hour period, whereas the Bitcoin price maintained gains of around 6%. Ethereum liquidations accounted for around 32% of the total figure, coming out to $105.13 million at the time of writing. The largest single liquidation event also happened on an ETH-USDT pair on the Huobi exchange, costing the trader $3.11 million. In constrast, Bitcoin liquidations came out to $96.53 million, but just like Ethereum, the figure was made up by a majority of short traders. Following behind Bitcoin is Solana with liquidations of $21.53 million. Other coins which saw substantial liquidations include Dogecoin with $7.42 million and PEPE with $4.3 million. Bitcoin And Ethereum Lead Market Rally The market rally that has shaken the market in the last day has mostly been led by Ethereum, with Bitcoin throwing in support. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked exchanges to update their 19b-4 filings, which are important to any Spot ETFs being approved. Related Reading Crypto Analyst Sounds Warning Alarm For Potential 50-60% Crash In Chainlink Price, Here’s Why 1 day ago Given this, the market sentiment had picked up as the expectation for the approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs spread. During this time, Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas also reviewed their approval odds for the funds, taking it from a low 25% to a high 75%. During this time, the price of Ethereum went from trending around $3,100 to rising above $3,700. At the same time, the Bitcoin price jumped above $71,000, triggering one of the best days for the crypto market so far in 2024.

    "content": "The Ethereum price has risen almost 20% in the last 24 hours. This is a positive development for the second-largest crypto token, which has been lagging until now. Ethereum’s price surge is believed to be due to several factors, including the potential approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs. SEC Could Soon Approve Spot Ethereum ETFs Ethereum has risen on the news that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve the Spot Ethereum ETF applications. Before now, it was almost certain that the Commission would deny these applications. However, the SEC is now open to approving these funds based on Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas’s revelation. Related Reading Bitcoin Retail Investors Are Dumping Amid Jump To $67,000, Why This Is Good For Price 1 day ago Balchunas revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he and fellow Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart were increasing their odds of Spot Ethereum ETF approval to 75% (from 25%), having heard that the SEC could likely approve these funds due to “increasingly political issue.” Seyffart also confirmed this development, stating that “things are taking a turn for the better on Spot #ethereum ETF approvals this week. Upping our odds to 75%.” Seyffart further noted in a subsequent X post that the 75% approval odds relate to the 19b-4 filings, with VanEck’s final deadline coming up on May 23. The SEC will still need to approve the S-1 filings before these funds can launch. S-1 approvals could take up to months, meaning that it could take a while before these Spot Ethereum ETFs go live. However, that hasn’t stopped Ethereum whales from believing, and this group of investors is another reason why ETH’s price has shot up recently. Data from the market intelligence platform shows that these whales bought over 110,000 ETH ($341 million) between May 19 and 20. This has turned out to be profitable since Ethereum’s price had been priced in on the rumors of a rejection. Time For Ethereum Price And Altcoins To Make Their Move With the recent development that the SEC will likely approve the Spot Ethereum ETFs, Ethereum and other altcoins look primed to make significant moves to the upside. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe had predicted that the news around the Spot Ethereum ETFs would trigger a rally for Ethereum and altcoins. Related Reading Bitcoin Price Mirrors Historical Pattern That Led To $1,200 Surge, Will History Repeat Itself? 1 day ago While explaining why he swapped his Bitcoin holdings for Altcoins, Van de Poppe suggested that Ethereum (and other altcoins) would likely see a bullish reversal once the news about a denial of the Spot Ethereum ETFs was out since the crypto token was already priced into this news. He added that things could even be better if the news turns out to be better than people expect, which is currently the case with the SEC looking increasingly likely to approve these funds. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Javon Marks predicted that an Ethereum breakout will kickstart the altcoin season. That already looks to be the case, seeing how other altcoins have enjoyed significant price gains in the last 24 hours thanks to the second largest crypto token by market cap.

    "content": "QCP Capital, a prominent institutional-focused firm, has recently projected that Bitcoin could revisit its peak price levels, potentially reaching up to $74,000 shortly. This prediction follows the latest United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which has significantly boosted risk assets. The firm noted that the positive surge in the market is partly due to the renewed buy-side demand, as evidenced by the buying patterns that resemble those of Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) market makers. Related Reading Most Important Bitcoin Indicator Nears Bullish Flip: $150,000 Soon? 6 days ago Institutional Inflows And Market Indicators Point To A Bitcoin Bullish Trend In a detailed analysis shared through their Telegram channel, QCP Broadcast, the firm stated: “We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of 74k.” Substantial institutional interest in Bitcoin supports this sentiment, as large asset managers like Millennium and Schonfeld have allocated about 3% and 2% of their Assets Under Management (AUM), respectively, to spot BTC ETFs. The optimism surrounding Bitcoin is not just theoretical but backed by significant market activity. For instance, inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US reached a two-week high of $303 million as of May 15th, signaling a robust renewal of institutional confidence. Fidelity’s FBTC fund led this influx with $131 million, followed by Bitwise’s BITB fund, which saw $86 million, marking its highest since early March. Grayscale’s GBTC, which had experienced outflows for four months, reversed this trend with a $27 million inflow. Yesterday, May 15, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETFs was $303 million. Grayscale ETF GBTC had a single-day net inflow of $27.0466 million, Fidelity ETF FBTC had an inflow of $131 million, and Bitwise ETF BITB had an inflow of $86.2578 million. https://t.co/npjWVH3bMi — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 16, 2024 Further underlining this bullish sentiment, Millennium Management holds a roughly $2 billion Bitcoin ETF portfolio, making it the largest holder of specific Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. Other hedge funds, including Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital and Apollo Management Holdings, have also disclosed significant holdings in Bitcoin ETFs, showcasing the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Market Performance And Future Outlook Bitcoin’s market performance has been quite notable. It has increased nearly 10% over the past week, including a 2.7% rise in the last 24 hours alone. BTC price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com QCP Capital attributes this trend to several factors, including significant “sovereign and institutional adoption, easing inflation concerns, and the upcoming US elections,” all of which contribute to a favorable market outlook. The positive sentiment is also partly due to the CPI data released on May 15th, which met expectations and eased concerns about inflation. This is crucial as lower inflation rates influence the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates, making riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking higher yields. James Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Realvision, also cited the Global Money Supply (M2) index as a critical indicator of Bitcoin’s price movements. According to Coutts, the M2 money aggregates, which include cash and checking deposits and are easily convertible near money, are central to understanding liquidity flows within the global financial system. He noted, “The money stock often moves in one direction, with significant drops like those seen in 2022 being rare and typically brief.” Related Reading Bitcoin Breaks Free: Emerging from Bearish Sentiment, Crypto Market Optimism Rises 6 days ago Coutts predicts that any significant break above Bitcoin’s all-time highs could pave the way for it to reach around $150,000 in this cycle. He remarked, “Watch the 101/102 level on DXY. If that breaks, then we should see ~$150k BTC this cycle,” emphasizing the interplay between liquidity and market cycles.

According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin ended its downtrend in mid-April, breaking into an uptrend with its price surpassing previous resistance levels. This change has been marked by Bitcoin forming its first higher high since its drop to $56,000, as highlighted by Rekt Capital. This indicates a possible continuation of the bull market despite periodic market attempts to unsettle investors. The TD Sequential indicator’s sell signal comes as Bitcoin has shown a 7.6% increase over the past seven days, reaching a 24-hour high of $66,567 before retracing slightly to $65,592. BTC price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com Rekt Capital noted the significance of the $60,000 support level, suggesting that maintaining this level is crucial for further positive momentum.

    "content": "In a remarkable turn of events, Bitcoin (BTC) has broken out of its recent trading range, recording a 7% surge in the past 24 hours alone. The cryptocurrency tests the $66,000 resistance level, setting the stage for a potential move toward higher targets. The latest momentum shift in Bitcoin’s price action has caught the attention of industry experts, particularly the co-founders of on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. According to their analysis, the trigger for a larger market structure release has been in the works since the March highs. Bitcoin Breaks Out The co-founders of Glassnode believe this breakout has been coming for a long time. They state that they have been waiting for the trigger to unleash a major bullish structure since the March highs when Bitcoin reached its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,700, and it looks like the market has finally done so. Related Reading Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu to Soar 50% Amidst Meme Coin Market Rise 6 days ago They believe the trigger was the recent lower-than-expected US inflation figures and weaker retail sales data, which could prompt a more “dovish stance” from the Federal Reserve. According to the Glassnode co-founders, this opens the door to a more dovish stance from the Fed. They explain that Bitcoin and the market liked this, and now they expect the price to reach $66,000 before $69,000 and then up towards $84,000. They also believe the altcoins will follow this move strongly. However, not all analysts are as bullish in the immediate term. Crypto trader and analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin needs to hold the $65,000 level as new support, cautioning that the $68,000 and $73,000 price levels could act as resistance and liquidity pockets. He warns that if Bitcoin loses the $65,000 support, it’s back to the “chopfest” – further consolidation and volatility. Andrew Tate Considers Dumping Fiat For BTC In a surprising move, popular internet personality and self-proclaimed “Top G” Andrew Tate has announced his intention to abandon fiat currency and invest over $100 million into Bitcoin. In a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Tate declared, “I’m about to leave fiat completely and ape over 100M into BTC.” Tate, who has faced numerous legal issues and has been banned from several social media platforms, cited his frustrations with the traditional banking system and fiat currency as the driving force behind this potential decision. “I’m done with the banks. I’m done with their money. Done with the scams,” he wrote in the post. Related Reading Ethereum Bull Flag Breakout: ATH On The Horizon As Major Metrics Turn Bullish 6 days ago In a follow-up post, Tate acknowledged that he has not finalized this decision, as he currently holds more cryptocurrency than fiat currency in his portfolio. However, he hinted that he might “leave fiat completely,” suggesting that his preference for Bitcoin and other digital assets is growing. The 1-D chart shows BTC’s trending upwards. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com As of press time, Bitcoin is testing the $65,900 mark, having regained its bullish momentum. It remains to be seen how far the current rally can extend and whether the bullish momentum can survive potential selling pressure at higher price levels.

    "content": "Mike Novogratz, the CEO and founder of Galaxy Digital, shared his insights on the current state of the cryptocurrency market. According to Bloomberg, Novogratz predicts that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely remain within a relatively narrow trading range for the current quarter as the adoption of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance continues to evolve. Stagnant Crypto Market Per the report, Novogratz described the current phase in the crypto market as a consolidation period. He emphasized that Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), are expected to consolidate. This consolidation phase suggests that the Bitcoin price will likely trade within a range of approximately $55,000 to $75,000 until significant market events drive prices higher. Related Reading On A Tear: Toncoin Outshines Bitcoin With Price Surge And Social Buzz 1 week ago The crypto market has experienced a period of stagnation following the historic bull run witnessed in the past two quarters. This surge was fueled by the launch of spot US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the Bitcoin Halving, which reduced the supply of new BTC. However, Bitcoin’s price trend reversed due to diminishing optimism surrounding interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), amid consistently strong economic indicators. According to Novogratz’s analysis, if his predictions hold, Solana could continue to consolidate within its current trading range of $120 to $150. This consolidation has been observed over the past month, indicating a period of stability for the cryptocurrency. Similarly, Ethereum’s price has closely mirrored Bitcoin’s movements and has traded between the $2,870 and $3,200 levels. Ethereum recently failed to consolidate above the significant $4,000 mark reached in mid-March. As a result, Ethereum has experienced a period of price consolidation within the range above. Bitcoin Volatility Persists Novogratz acknowledged the tailwinds that propelled the market during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Galaxy’s CEO believes that these tailwinds will likely persist throughout the current quarter and possibly the next unless there are significant developments, such as the Fed initiating rate cuts due to an economic slowdown or until the regulatory landscape becomes clearer after the upcoming election. Moreover, Novogratz noted a significant shift in counterparties’ willingness to lend crypto for extended periods without collateral, a trend that was not prevalent just six months ago. He emphasized that engagement in the crypto space has reached a new level, with growing interest from individuals and institutions alike.

Since achieving a record high of $73,700 on March 14, the largest cryptocurrency in the market has undergone a 16% decline. Despite this, Galaxy Digital reported notable first-quarter results, with net income more than tripling to $421.7 million. The daily chart shows that BTC’s price is trending downward.

    "content": "A crucial Bitcoin metric has just turned bullish, sparking optimism from a crypto analyst regarding an impending rally for Bitcoin. This unique technical pattern suggests that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could see its price ascending further, potentially kick-starting a highly welcomed bull run this cycle. Bitcoin Technical Pattern Flips Bullish Bitcoin’s price has often followed distinct historical patterns, with the majority of these indicators preceding significant rallies or bearish trends. One of the most compelling signs that Bitcoin may be turning bullish again is seen as the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) Oscillator breaks below the lower Bollinger Bands, a technical indicator used to measure a market’s volatility and momentum. Related Reading Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run 4 days ago According to a crypto analyst identified as ‘Dominando Cripto’ on X (formerly Twitter), the SSR is a unique technical tool designed to evaluate the market sentiment by comparing the supply of stablecoins to Bitcoin. This tool is used by analysts and traders to identify buying and selling opportunities for Bitcoin. Additionally, it quantifies how the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the SSR moves within the Bollinger Bands. Source: X Dominando Cripto has provided an in-depth explanation of how the SSR oscillator is calculated and how to interpret its signals for identifying bullish trends. “The oscillator is calculated by taking the difference between the current Stablecoin Supply Ratio value and its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), then dividing it by the standard deviation of the SSR over the same period,” the analyst stated. Sharing a price chart depicting movements of the SSR oscillator, the crypto analyst suggests that when the oscillator moves above the upper Bollinger Bands, it suggests that the SSR is significantly higher than normal levels. This indicates that stablecoins are dominating the market, signaling bearish sentiment and a potential downturn for Bitcoin. Conversely, when the oscillator falls below the lower Bollinger Band, it indicates that the SSR is low, highlighting the reduced dominance of stablecoins and signaling bullish sentiment that could potentially trigger an incoming rally in Bitcoin. In the above price chart, Dominando Crypto pinpointed several instances when the SSR oscillator displayed bearish and bullish sentiment, identifying these periods as heated zones and cold zones, respectively. Recent market movements indicate that the SSR oscillator is in the cold zone, indicating a potential bullish outlook for Bitcoin. More Bullish Signs For BTC On May 18, Blockchain analytics platform, Santiment, revealed a new market trend where small traders are consistently liquidating their BTC holdings, even as the cryptocurrency has shown positive performance lately.

    "content": "There are important developments around Render (RNDR), Ethereum (ETH), and Raboo (RABT). Render has achieved exceptional milestones, highlighting the increasing relevance of AI cryptos. Ethereum has managed to hold above the crucial $3k support level while Raboo’s presale continues to grow. These developments highlight the growing interest in AI cryptos and influence the ETH price, while Raboo stands out as a promising investment option. Render (RNDR) Reaches Exceptional Milestones Render (RNDR) has recently achieved exceptional milestones. This highlights the growing relevance of AI cryptos in the market. The Render Network offers a decentralized solution for rendering graphics. This is making it particularly attractive to artists and developers. Render’s recent successes reinforce confidence in AI cryptos’ ability to transform the industry. These advancements have led to an increase in the value and popularity of RNDR. There are also disadvantages to the Render project. The network faces significant technical challenges, such as the complexity of decentralized rendering and the need for high computing power. Furthermore, the dependence on adoption by artists and developers can be a barrier, especially if competitors enter the market with more advanced technologies. These factors can impact Render’s long-term growth and sustainability. Ethereum (ETH) Remains Above the $3K Ethereum (ETH) has managed to hold above the critical $3k support level. This is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and momentum in the market. This development comes amid the wider adoption of AI cryptos. It strengthens the position of Ethereum as a leading platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. The current ETH price remains a major concern for anyone who relies on the stability and functionality of the Ethereum network. There are some disadvantages associated with the Ethereum project. The scalability issues and high transaction fees remain a challenge, especially compared to newer blockchains that offer better solutions. Also, the transition to Ethereum 2.0 is a long and complex process. This entails uncertainty about the future performance and stability of the network. These factors could deter investors and hinder long-term adoption of Ethereum. Raboo (RABT) Has Over $1.3m Raised Raboo (RABT) is currently in the third phase of its presale. Tokens are available for $0.0042 each. The presale has already raised more than $1.3 million. This underscores the strong investor interest in this promising project. Raboo combines the power of AI and SocialFi. It also places a strong emphasis on community engagement with its unique Post-to-Earn feature. This innovative approach offers investors a unique opportunity to be part of a growing ecosystem. Raboo has the potential to significantly change the market. By getting in now, investors can take advantage of the early access and associated benefits. Raboo will continue to grow and reach its full potential. Conclusion Despite Render’s promising milestones and stable ETH price, Raboo emerges as the most promising investment option. With its innovative combination of AI and SocialFi technologies and a strong focus on community engagement, Raboo offers a solid and future-oriented investment. The presale has already raised more than $1.3 million, highlighting the growing interest and potential of this project. Raboo offers investors a unique opportunity to get in early and benefit from its enormous growth potential. You can participate in the Raboo presale here.

    "content": "Data suggests users on Binance responded to the Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) news by aggressively longing the cryptocurrency. Ethereum Net Taker Volume On Binance Has Just Seen Its Biggest Candle Ever As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the Ethereum Net Taker Volume has observed a sharp increase after rumors have surfaced that the ETH spot ETFs have a renewed chance of gaining approval. The “Net Taker Volume” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the ETH taker buy and taker sell volumes on any given centralized exchange. Related Reading Litecoin Whales Go On $230 Million Buying Spree: Will This Change LTC’s Stars? 1 day ago When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the taker buy or long volume is outpacing the taker sell or short volume on the platform right now. Such a trend implies a bullish sentiment is dominant among the investors. On the other hand, the indicator being negative suggests the presence of a majority bearish mentality among the users of the exchange as the shorts are outpacing the longs. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum Net Taker Volume on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance over the last few years: The value of the metric appears to have been quite high in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Net Taker Volume on Binance has just registered a huge positive spike, the implying investors have just opened a large amount of longs on the platform. More specifically, the indicator’s value during this spike has been $530 million, which, according to the analyst, is the single largest spike the cryptocurrency has ever seen. “Binance-traders are longing the Ethereum ETF-news like there is no tomorrow,” notes Maartunn. This isn’t particularly surprising, considering the market is very well aware what a spot ETF could mean for the asset after having witnessed what went down for Bitcoin. The ETF news pre-approval had been bullish for BTC and while the approval itself had initially led to bearish price action, it eventually paid off for the asset as capital started rapidly flowing in through these investment vehicles and the coin enjoyed a rally that led to a new all-time high (ATH). In another X post, the CryptoQuant analyst pointed out that the Ethereum Open Interest has shot up as well. The “Open Interest” measures the total amount of ETH-related positions that are currently open on all derivative exchanges. Looks like the indicator has observed some sharp uptrend recently | Source: @JA_Maartun on X This trend isn’t that unexpected, given that derivatives users have been opening a large amount of longs for the asset. With this rapid surge, the Ethereum Open Interest has managed to set a new ATH. Related Reading Bitcoin “Profit-Taking Has Completed,” Top Analyst Reveals 1 day ago Historically, intense speculation has generally led to more volatility for the coin, as the risk of large liquidations happening can become high in such periods.

    "content": "The Bitcoin price recovery above the $67,000 level has triggered a round of selling, but it is not from the usual camp of large investors selling. This time around, it is the small-time traders who are offloading their bags and putting selling pressure on the price. However, this is not an entirely bad thing given that, historically, such selling has been bullish for the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin Retail Are Dumping Their Bags In a report on X (formerly Twitter), the on-chain data tracker Santiment revealed an interesting trend among small-time Bitcoin investors. As the price of Bitcoin rallied past $67,000 over the weekend, these small wallets took this as the time to sell and secure profit. Related Reading Cardano Whales Return To The Table, Increase Massive Holdings By 10% 3 days ago These wallets are those holding below 0.1 BTC on their balances. This means that at the high end, these wallets are holding an average of $6,000. In the space of one week, Santiment notes that their collective holdings had dropped 0.46%. ?? #Bitcoin is dancing just above $66.1K as small traders continue to #liquidate their holdings despite the #crypto bounce over the past week. Historically, small wallets dumping their coins to larger wallets is an encouraging and #bullish sign for $BTC. https://t.co/wlz4XPhfMD pic.twitter.com/dTJAy5G6pL — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 19, 2024 Selling among smaller wallets is not new, but at this level, it could have a significant impact on the price. However, compared to when whale and sharks sell their BTC holdings, retail investors selling is usually bullish for the price. This is because as the smaller traders sell, the BTC is picked up by the larger traders, who are usually longer-term holdings. As blockchain agency Crynet explains in a response to Santiment: “While small traders divesting might seem concerning, it’s often a bullish signal. Historically, this redistribution to larger holders indicates stronger hands in the market. Let’s see how this plays out.” Bullish Sentiment Rises Among Investors The selling by small Bitcoin traders comes amid a jump in bullishness. As Santiment reported in a previous post, bullishness among Bitcoin investors has now jumped to a 4-month high. The last time that investors were this bullish was back in January 2024 when the price of BTC had jumped above $45,000. Related Reading Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run 4 days ago Bitcoin’s weighted sentiment is now sitting at a value of 0.99, and although this is still lower than its January high of almost 1.8, it remains one of the highest among large caps. Currently, only the Chainlink (LINK) weighted sentiment is higher after rising to a new one-year high of 1.829. ? The crowd’s sentiment has shifted toward #Bitcoin after the surprise bounce above $66K Wednesday (and now above $67.2K). Additionally, #Chainlink is seeing its most #bullish sentiment in over a year. #FOMO staying low will help these rises continue. https://t.co/TcEPBdS9Oh pic.twitter.com/czvE1mOgId — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 17, 2024 The Ethereum weighted sentiment is currently sitting at a low -0.44, while XRP and Binance’s BNB are sitting at around -0.37. This suggests that bearishness continues to dominate among these assets while crypto investors look to Bitcoin to lead the market. At the time of writing, the BTC price is still trading at a high price of $66,900. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is seeing a 6.78% increase in the last week and a small decline of 0.5% in the last day, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) did not have the spike in price many predicted after its halving event. History had told us BTC would reach an all-time high soon after the event but it is likely the all-time prices set earlier in the year distorted its chances. Bitcoin then lost a bit of its gains and started to hiver around the $60-$62k mark. Now Bitcoin has started to rally again and, at the time of writing, is above $66k. This has led experts to ponder, what is next for Bitcoin. In an interesting piece, one crypto writer provides data that suggest the bulls could push Bitcoin all the way to $90k which would be yet another all time high in 2024. While Bitcoin may be headed to new heights we think investing in these up-and-coming altcoins could see more explosive returns on investment. We found seven presale tokens we think have the unique properties necessary to explode during the next bull run. Here they are: Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE) Sealana ($SEAL) WienerAI($WAI) 99Bitcoins Token ($99BTC) 5thScape (5SCAPE) Sponge V2 ($SPONGEV2) Pikamoon (PIKA) Let’s take a look at each project and see why they are promising investments. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet The Best Crypto Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Dogeverse- The promising new Doge alternative that’s the first of its kind Readers who pay close attention to the presale market would have noticed more Dogecoin alternatives popping up. This is not a coincidence, Dogecoin (DOGE) has only made minuscule gains when compared to other meme coins during a period of explosive growth for the whole sector. Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE) could be the final nail in the coffin as its presale indicators DOGE investors are jumping ship. The Dogeverse presale began less than two months ago but has already raised well north of $15 million. This is not normal for a meme coin so it definitely indicates a changing of the tides. Dogeverse itself is also modeled around a pup meme but this dog is a space called Cosmo. He was born with the unique ability to jump from chain to chain. This makes Doegverse a multi-chain token and also the first project that will be available on six networks. Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, and BNB Smart Chain are the layer 1s, alongside Layer 2s such as Polygon and Base. Given Solana’s surprise rise past Ethereum as the most popular network with altcoin investors, this move by Dogeverse gives it versatility for the future. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Dogeverse Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sealana- This South Park-inspired meme coin looks like the real deal As you will see this list is very heavy on meme coins. The market is exploding and April saw an all-time high 138 new releases added to the sector. Solana has been the network that has stared during this expansion as a lot of the best performers come from its network. Hoping to be next up on this list is Sealana ($SEAL). We love the subtle nature of the meme behind Sealana as it’s a well-meaning dig at crypto enthusiasts based on an inaccurate stereotype. The character Sealana is based on is actually a gamer from the “Make Love Not War’ episode. The character keeps killing the boys characters in the game World of Warcraft. The joke is to be a player this strong you have to have no life and play the game 24/7. Sealana is a seal version of this character who is a patriot that is stuck in his mom’s basement trading crypto all day. We know meme coin lovers can take a joke and we think they will love Sealana. Rumors that the people behind Slerf Token (SLERF) are also involved with Sealana only strengthen our prediction that it will pump. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sealana Now\u003c\u003c\u003c WienerAI- The futuristic dog that is here to bring its investors massive gains One development the meme coin market has seen recently since its explosion in popularity is the merging of meme coins with other entities. One of the most popular is AI. The new technology has been coveted by the crypto market as many see it as a way to attract investors. WienerAI ($WAI) has taken a very interesting approach to incorporating AI into its project. Nearly every single other meme coin project has used AI to add utility in some way. WienerAI, however, wishes to go down the traditional meme coin route of the actual meme being the attraction. This means they wish to rely on virality so they have used AI to give its meme a background story. It begins in the year 2132 where we are transported to a place called New Silicon Valley. We find ourselves in a laboratory owned by a mad scientist who goes by the architect. Here he is devising an experiment that combines pups and AI. However, at the last second, he accidentally drops a sausage into the mix and we are left with WienerAI. We think this story will attract tons of investors. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy WienerAI Now\u003c\u003c\u003c 99Bitcoins Token- We can’t wait to see what this learn-to-earn platform has to offer One thing that investors should look out for when investing in a new project is industry knowledge. One example of this is when creators involved with one successful project start another. Another is what we have with 99Bitcoins Token ($99BTC). They run the biggest crypto learning platform on the market and now they have turned their attention to Web 3. They have sold over 2 million courses to crypto enthusiasts and have over 750k followers of their YouTube channel so there is a good chance a portion of you reading this have gained some valuable knowledge from them. The presale has so far raised over $1.3 million as investors seem to be excited to see what they will bring to the crypto market. How the learn-to-earn model works is investors will be able to learn $99BTC by passing through levels of the curriculum and by interacting with the community. What’s great about this is investors can learn more about the market while also earning crypto. $99BTc can be used to access premium content, purchase partner content, and of course trade on the market. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy 99Bitcoins token Now\u003c\u003c\u003c 5thScape- Get ready for a taste of the future with this VR token The crypto market prides itself on being ahead of the curve and that is exactly what 5thScape (5SCAPE) is doing with this project. They believe that the future of VR will be tokenized and they are hoping to lead the charge with this futuristic coin. If you purchase the 5SCAPE token you will have access to the best VR educational resources, the latest blockbuster movies, and of course the best VR video games. Although they do plan to release their own in-house VR goggles, the creators have made the current version compatible with other VR headsets already on the market like the Oculus. With presale tokens, the amount the project raises isn’t always indicative of how the listings will go but one that raises a lot during the presale period is still a great sign. The 5thScape presale is just about to hit the $6 million raised mark which is a clear indicator that investors are ready for the future of VR. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy 5thScape Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sponge V2- With a new P2E game added to the mix this V2 meme could be huge Sponge V2 ($SPONGEV2) is a meme coin we are very excited about. Who can blame us when you consider how successful version 1 Sponge Token ($SPONGE) was? The people behind the project have also come up with a very innovative way to go from one project to the other, a problem a lot of other projects have faced before. The process is called stake-to-bridge. Investors who wish to purchase the new $SPONGEV2, must first purchase and then stake the original $SPONGE. When they do so an equivalent amount of version 2 is purchased and stored away for them. Once the total allocation of version 1 is sold out then version 2 will launch and investors will receive their $SPONGEV2 along with their staking rewards. Sponge V2 will add an exciting P2E racing game to add utility to the ecosystem. Given how successful Sponge Token was this could make it huge. In 2023, Sponge Token was launched and soon became a cult hero. It pumped by hundreds of percent in a bearish market and eventually ended up on 10 exchanges. \u003e\u003eBuy Sponge V2 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Pikamoon- Another exciting meme coin/P2E combo we think will pump Pikamoon (PIKA) has chosen a route for its project we can fully get on board with. The meme coin/P2E crossover is always a good combination but taking inspiration from a traditional giant is the icing on the cake. The creators will be hoping to entice fans of Pokemon, one of the largest traditional gaming franchises of all time, to try this blockchain version. Players will be able to explore four different universes in the game which together are called the Pikaverse. They will do this alongside the NFT sidekick they mint at the beginning of the game. Players can earn PIKA in-game by completing challenges and battling other players. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet The Best Crypto Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Conclusion So, despite some ambitious Bitcoin forecasts we have decided to look elsewhere for coins that should explode during the next bull run. With a meme coin-heavy focus, all the projects contain unique qualities necessary to attract investors. We are confident all of them can provide a good ROI.\n\n",

    "summary": "James Coutts predicts a potential bullish turn for Bitcoin price in the near future, attributing it to the Global Money Supply.\n\n",
    "content": "In a recent analysis, James Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Realvision, signaled a potential bullish turn in Bitcoin’s near future, attributing the forecasted change to shifts in global liquidity measures, specifically the Global Money Supply (M2) index which is widely seen as most important price catalyst. Coutts detailed this anticipation in a thread on X, where he examined the relationship between major economic indicators and Bitcoin’s price cycles. Global Money Supply And Its Correlation With Bitcoin Coutts’ analysis begins with the M2 money aggregates, which consist of cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money. He tracks these aggregates across the 12 largest economies, all adjusted to USD. This measure, he suggests, is central to understanding liquidity flows within the global fiat, credit-based financial system. According to Coutts, “The money stock often moves in one direction, with significant drops like those seen in 2022 being rare and typically brief.” Related Reading Bitcoin Soaring Toward $84,000: Insights From Glassnode Co-Founders 6 days ago Currently, the Global M2 is neutral, but Coutts predicts imminent changes: “There is a sea of red across my macro \u0026 liquidity dashboard, but signs are emerging that this is about to change. Global M2 holds the key for the next leg of the cycle due to its high correlation with $BTC bull cycles.” The rate of change in M2 money supply is more critical than its nominal value. Coutts noted, “The chart confirms what our MSI performance table suggests: Bitcoin usually moves with shifts in M2 momentum.” He explained that despite the global money supply MSI indicator being in an uptrend, the momentum remains sluggish, maintaining a Neutral MSI. For a shift to a bullish MSI signal, an increase in momentum is necessary, requiring a combination of dollar depreciation, credit expansion, and increased government debt issuance. Coutts pointed out the crucial role of credit conditions, as evidenced by corporate bond spreads (BBB/Baa) compared to the US 10-year Treasury yield, which have historically aligned with significant inflections in Bitcoin’s cycle. “These spreads are currently narrowing, indicating that corporations are managing to issue and roll over debt despite the high interest rates resulting from the record hikes in 2022 and 2023,” he observed. Related Reading $291 Billion Asset Manager Founder Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $420,000 1 week ago Using the chameleon trend indicator on the corporate spread index, Coutts suggests a strategy: “Long Bitcoin when the index shows a bearish trend (red) and stay alert for potential trend reversals (turning green).” The Role Of the Dollar And Future Outlook A key to this cycle, according to Coutts, is the behavior of the DXY (Dollar Index), which measures the US dollar against a basket of foreign currencies. “The Dollar is range-bound. A break below 101 would be rocket fuel for Bitcoin,” he asserted, emphasizing that market sentiment on liquidity is often reflected in real-time by DXY movements. Coutts also touched upon the US debt situation, suggesting that without a conservative shift in Congress advocating for fiscal responsibility, more deficit spending is likely on the horizon, which could further influence liquidity conditions favorable to Bitcoin. Coutts concluded with a note of caution mixed with optimism: “While my framework needs 2/3 MSI indicators to turn Bullish for macro headwinds to turn into tailwinds, Bitcoin price action will probably sniff out this inflection in the macro before most indicators react.” His analysis suggests that if Bitcoin breaks above its all-time highs, it would be unwise to bet against it, anticipating potential climbs towards $150,000 in this cycle. “The DXY holds the key to the Bitcoin cycle as it prices in mkt expectations on liquidity in real time. And liquidity is coming. Watch the 101/102 level on DXY If that breaks, then we should see ~$150k btc this cycle,” he remarked. At press time, BTC traded at $66,090.

    "summary": "Bitcoin may soon experience another price rally following an increase in the supply of a specific stablecoin.\n\n",
    "content": "According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin rose by 2.9% on Friday to trade above $67,000 for the first time since April 24. This positive price performance by the maiden cryptocurrency has been attributed to the low inflation levels reported in the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. However, Bitcoin is an asset subject to the influence of several forces. According to a report by blockchain analysis platform LookonChain, BTC may soon experience another price rally following an increase in the supply of a specific stablecoin. Related Reading: Unstoppable Bitcoin? CryptoQuant’s CEO Foresees Bull Run Extending To 2025 Can USDT Replicate Surging Effect On Bitcoin? In an X post on Friday, LookonChain reported that the Tether Treasury has minted an additional 1 billion USDT indicating a consistent rising demand for the stablecoin. USDT which ranks as the third largest cryptocurrency doubles as the most dominant stablecoin in the crypto space with a market cap value of $111.25 billion. The USDT token has famously recorded much growth in the last year with over 31 billion new tokens minted on the Tron and Ethereum network. Interestingly, LookonChain reveals that this rise in USDT market share contributed significantly to Bitcoin’s ascent from $27,000 to $73,000 in the past fifteen months. The theory behind this relationship stems from an increase in traders’ liquidity provided by investments in USDT. This increased market liquidity can alter the status of Bitcoin’s supply and demand and oftentimes lead to a rise in BTC’s price. Following the most recent 1 billion USDT minted by the Tether Treasury, most investors and spectators could be expecting a similar boosting effect on Bitcoin’s price, especially with the crypto bull season in play. However, Bitcoin’s price in the coming months is still likely to be influenced by other factors such as the BTC spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. According to data from SoSoValue, net inflows on Friday reached $177.01 million bringing the total value of the Bitcoin spot ETF market to $12.58 billion. As more major traditional finance players gain a piece of this novel market, Bitcoin is expected to experience monumental levels of demand which will translate into weighty price gains.

The Bitcoin liquidity cycle is simply a chart showing the boom and bust periods of the world’s most valuable coin. Every cycle in history is highly influenced by the availability and flow of capital in and out of the asset. The analyst is upbeat, arguing that though prices are down from all-time highs and appear stuck in a consolidation, the coin is still in a “warm-up” phase. Woo adds that the current consolidation period means the long-term risk is low in light of the relatively high liquidity.

Bitcoin market versus realized caps | Source: @ki_young_ju via X To explain this view, the founder noted that Bitcoin’s capitalization has been growing faster than the realized cap. The realized cap is a metric that aims to gauge the total value of all coins in circulation based on the price at which they were last moved.

It has broken above the key $66,000 resistance level and turned it into a new support zone. BTC Bounces Back As Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar The resurgence in Bitcoin’s price has been closely tied to a rekindling of inflows into the US spot Bitcoin ETF market. Data from Farside shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their best inflow week in two months, with the US fund category collectively notching $948 million in positive net flows from May 13 to May 17. Interestingly, the majority of these inflows, approximately 89%, occurred in the last three trading days of the week, which industry analysts and researchers such as James Butterfill of CoinShares attribute to a shift in investor sentiment following the release of a lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Wednesday. Butterfill stated: The inflows were an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report, highlighting our view that Bitcoin prices have recoupled to interest rate expectations.

Notably, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has seen outflows of $16.6 billion since the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF in January, saw small inflows totaling $18 million. Beyond just spot Bitcoin ETFs, the digital asset investment product space experienced inflows for the second consecutive week, totaling $932 million, according to CoinShares. However, trading volumes remained relatively low at $10.5 billion, compared to the $40 billion seen in March. Bitcoin Poised For Further Gains? The renewed institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and the broader digital asset space has coincided with a strong price recovery for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s ability to firmly hold the $66,250 support level, with over 530,000 BTC traded at this price, has given analysts confidence in the asset’s potential for further gains. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, if the $66,000 support holds, Bitcoin could see strong potential for further gains in the coming days, demonstrating the bullish sentiment surrounding the largest cryptocurrency on the market. However, while Bitcoin has managed to bounce back above the crucial $66,000 level after the recent pullback, the leading cryptocurrency still faces a critical test as it attempts to break out of its established trading range.

The analyst further explains that Bitcoin has been oscillating between its low and high range between $60,000 and $70,000 for over two months, a natural consolidation process.

    "content": "The development of Web3 ecosystems is a significant milestone in the digital domain. They use decentralized and blockchain-based solutions that can transform several industries. These ecosystems aim to modify our approach to managing digital assets, data, and transactions, transforming online interactions as we now understand them. While there is widespread excitement about Web3, it is crucial to remember that mere popularity does not guarantee sustained success. Several platforms have had challenges sustaining their progress due to a deficiency in ongoing community engagement and expansion. Essential Elements of a Strong Community The main support mechanism of a robust Web3 ecosystem is its capacity to attract and retain developers. These ecosystems’ applications, innovations, and structures are mostly the developers’ work. Three main criteria drive their engagement: security, speed, and pricing. Developers seek platforms that provide economical solutions to optimize their spending and manage resources effectively. Additionally significant is speed since developers must quickly offer applications and transactions to stay competitive in rapidly changing markets. Similar importance is attached to security; developers want tight guidelines and protections to keep their data and assets secure from threats. Web3 platforms hoping to establish a vibrant developer community must adhere to the 80/20 rule. This concept holds that creating an environment that fully satisfies developer needs should receive 80% of the work. Platforms that stress building safe, efficient, and reasonably priced infrastructure may provide a solid foundation for developer participation and innovation. Nonetheless, the remaining 20% of funds must be allocated to outreach and incentive initiatives. Although a good environment attracts developers, intentional outreach and incentive schemes are needed to boost community growth and maintain involvement. Platforms may effectively include developers through clever partnerships, targeted marketing campaigns, and special incentive plans, creating a vibrant ecosystem driven by collaboration and creativity. Proactive Outreach and Incentive Programs Prom, a Layer 2 solution aimed at improving interoperability across multiple blockchain networks, including EVM and non-EVM compatible chains, is one platform that uses incentive programs. It sends transaction proofs to additional chains on the selected Settlement chain, boosting connections across ecosystems. Prom, powered by Polygon, reduces transaction costs using zkSNARKs technology, making it a low-cost blockchain solution. It also uses Polygon Zero and powerful recursive STARK technology for quick transactions and scalable dApp development, which appeals to both developers and consumers. Furthermore, Prom’s EVM-equivalent design facilitates integration with the current Ethereum infrastructure, simplifying development and lowering costs. Prom emphasizes aggressive marketing and comprehensive incentive schemes to increase network participation and foster a dynamic community. It works with teams and products that are vital to the expansion of the ecosystem, as well as providing grants and assistance to projects that contribute to Prom’s development. Prom’s incentive scheme includes a referral program that pays users $PROM tokens to introduce friends and expand its user base. In addition, Prom provides fee kickback rates ranging from 10% to 50% to encourage community members to actively participate in the referral program. Creating the Ideal Environment for Developers To build a favorable environment for developers in Web3 ecosystems, platforms must solve their primary concerns: price, speed, and security. They should strive to create cost-effective solutions that enable developers to effectively manage resources and maximize the value of their investments. Speed is also important since developers must launch applications quickly and interface with blockchain networks smoothly to remain competitive. Strong security measures are also required to safeguard developers’ assets and data from attacks while increasing confidence in the platform. Successful systems that focus on developer demands provide useful examples. They have incorporated novel methods to increase price, speed, and security, creating a community where developers can interact and contribute. Partnerships, infrastructure optimization, and support campaigns have made these platforms ideal for developers seeking to construct and deploy decentralized apps. However, establishing the best atmosphere for developers is a continuous effort. Platforms must be adaptive, always monitoring and adapting to changes in developer expectations and market trends. Platforms that respond to feedback may improve their products to better suit developers’ changing demands. This continual adaption is critical for being competitive and relevant in the ever-changing Web3 scene, as it ensures that platforms remain appealing and useful to developers looking to cooperate and create within decentralized ecosystems. Potential Challenges Building strong and long-lasting communities on Web3 platforms isn’t without its challenges. Maintaining relevance in continual technological and business upheavals is a major challenge. Platforms also struggle with the harmony between decentralization and governance to include the community while preserving direction. Platforms try to welcome individuals from all origins and points of view; hence, it might be difficult to guarantee diversity and inclusion in the community. The long-term sustainability of Web3 platforms relies on their use of focused operations and strategic approaches. It takes open and honest channels of communication that promote trust and collaboration for platforms to deal with problems and seek guidance. Those who can access educational resources and support services could become more active and transform their communities. If we want to create a warm environment where everyone feels valued, diversity and inclusion programs must be encouraged. Platforms should also prioritize scalability and interoperability in order to collaborate with other networks and adjust to the community’s evolving requirements. By making partnerships and funding strong technological infrastructure, platforms could overcome large-scale challenges and promote innovation. Using decentralized governance techniques, community members may acquire agency and guarantee that decisions are made openly and advantageously. Conclusion Building a strong Web3 group takes a lot of time, work, and money. It’s more important to be proactive and thoughtful than to be famous for a short time. To be successful in the difficult Web3 environment over the long term, platforms must focus on community-building projects. By investing in involvement and partnerships and adapting to changing needs, platforms can build strong communities that encourage working together and creativity. I want platforms to take action and focus on building active and welcoming communities. This will set the stage for future growth and development in the Web3 environment.\n\n",

    "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons have recently gone through a crossover. Here’s what it could mean for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Suggest Miner Capitulation Is On As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a Quicktake post, miners are capitulating right now if the Hash Ribbons indicator is to be believed. This on-chain metric is generally used to determine whether miners are in distress. BTC runs on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism where miners play the role of validators and compete against each other using computing power to get a chance to add the next block to the chain. This computing power, when measured across the network, can provide insight into the health of the miners as a whole. Due to this reason, the Hash Ribbons indicator makes use of this total Bitcoin “Hashrate” to judge the situation of the miners. Related Reading Bitcoin Price Linked To Binance Vs Coinbase Battle, Quant Reveals 1 week ago Naturally, a rise in the Hashrate suggests the network is attracting miners right now, while a decline could imply low profitability is making some of these validators pull out from BTC. The Hash Ribbons indicator uses two moving averages (MA) of the Hashrate, 30-day and 60-day, to represent whether these behaviors are particularly intense or not at the moment. When the 30-day ribbon moves under the 60-day one, it suggests that miners are mass capitulating. On the other hand, the opposite cross suggests network is observing growth again. Now, what relevance do these trends have for Bitcoin? According to Charles Edwards, the creator of the Hash Ribbons, the miners have historically been quite resilient, and they only quit when things get especially bad for the cryptocurrency. As such, the market may be more likely to approach a bottom whenever these chain validators show capitulation. Below is a chart that shows how the miners’ behaviour has looked recently according to this indicator: Looks like the two ribbons have gone through a cross recently | Source: CryptoQuant As Maartunn has highlighted in the graph, the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons have seen a crossover recently. More specifically, the cross has involved the 30-day moving under the 60-day, implying that the miners are capitulating. Miner profits come down to three factors: BTC spot price, transaction fees, and electricity costs in the area that they are located in. Historically, the fees has been quite low in comparison to the block rewards, so miner financials have been dependent on the price (as the block rewards only have this variable attached to them) and electricity prices. Recently, the BTC price has been stuck in consolidation while the block rewards have been slashed in half in the latest Halving event. This has led to tightening revenues for these chain validators, so it’s not surprising to see that the miners with the least efficient machines have already started ditching the network in hordes.

As the analyst notes, “It unfolds in the subsequent days and weeks after less efficient miners throw in the towel.” BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to move overall flat over the past week as its price is still trading around $62,700.

    "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross still has a high value, a sign that may be bearish for BTC. Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Is Still Near Historical Top Zone In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the recent trend in the NVT Golden Cross for BTC and its implications for the price. The NVT ratio is an indicator that tells us about how the Bitcoin market cap compares against its transaction volume. The metric is generally used to judge whether the asset’s price is fair or not right now. Related Reading Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Form Capitulation Signal: What It Means 6 days ago When the indicator’s value is high, it suggests the network’s value (that is, the market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins (the volume). Such a trend implies that the asset may be overpriced currently. On the other hand, the low metric means the cryptocurrency’s price may be undervalued due to a rebound as the market cap is low compared to the volume. In the context of the current topic, the NVT ratio itself isn’t of interest; rather, it is a modified form called the NVT Golden Cross. This metric compares the short-term trend (the 10-day moving average) with the long-term trend (30-day MA) of the NVT ratio to identify tops and bottoms. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this Bitcoin indicator over the past couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have been relatively high in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant In the graph, the quant has highlighted the two relevant zones for the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross. It would appear that when this metric is above 2.2, a top can be probable for the cryptocurrency as its price is overvalued in this zone. Similarly, the NVT Golden Cross being under -1.6 can lead to a bottom formation for the asset. The Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has ventured into the red territory for the last couple of months. Each time it has seen a decline out of the zone, it has followed up with another rise into the zone. As such, it hasn’t been able to visit the bullish region yet. At present, the metric has just made another exit out of the top zone, but its value is still quite near it. Thus, while a top may not be especially probable now, a lasting uptrend is also unlikely to happen. Related Reading Bitcoin Price Linked To Binance Vs Coinbase Battle, Quant Reveals 1 week ago It’s possible that Bitcoin won’t be completely out of danger of observing more price drawdowns until the NVT Golden Cross can see a decrease in the green zone. It now remains to be seen how the indicator develops in the near future and whether its changes will affect the BTC price. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around the $64,900 mark, up more than 4% over the past week.

Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator Could Imply Potential For Further Upside In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo discussed what the latest trend in the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator for BTC might suggest regarding what could be next for the cryptocurrency. The VWAP is an indicator that calculates the average price for any asset by taking into account the price fluctuations themselves and weighing the values against the trading volume. Related Reading XRP \u0026 Cardano Whales Load Up Bags: Preparation For Altcoin Rally? 5 days ago This means that the prices of the assets where there was a higher volume of trading have a higher weightage in the average than those with only a low amount of volume. Traditionally, the VWAP is a technical analysis indicator that considers the information available through spot exchanges. In the context of the current topic, the VWAP uses the on-chain volume of Bitcoin instead, which is readily viewable by anyone thanks to the blockchain’s transparency. The indicator of interest here isn’t the VWAP but rather the VWAP Oscillator, as mentioned earlier. This metric keeps track of the ratio between the BTC spot price and the VWAP and presents it as an oscillator of around zero. The chart below shows the trend of this Bitcoin indicator over the past couple of years. The value of the metric appears to have been negative in recent weeks | Source: @woonomic on X The above graph shows that the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator has been in negative territory for the past couple of months. However, the metric’s value has been rising recently, so if it continues on this trajectory, it might approach the neutral mark shortly. In the chart, Woo has highlighted a trend that the indicator and the cryptocurrency’s price have historically shown. It seems that whenever the metric has formed a bottom in negative territory and rebounded back to the upside, the asset has enjoyed some bullish momentum. The resulting price surge may last until the indicator reverses into the positive territory and forms a top. That hasn’t happened for the VWAP Oscillator this time yet. “Still a lot of room to run before reversal or consolidation,” says the analyst. “Hate to be a trapped Bitcoin bear right now.” Related Reading Bitcoin Not Out Of Danger Yet, NVT Golden Cross Warns 6 days ago In other news, as CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr. pointed out in an X post, retail investors have bought $135.7 million worth of the asset over the past month.

    "content": "On-chain data suggests demand for Bitcoin remains significant as newcomer whales in the sector have been scooping up 200,000 BTC every week. Short-Term Holder Bitcoin Whales Have Continued To Accumulate Recently As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the demand among the short-term holder whales has decreased since the all-time high, although it still continues to remain strong. Related Reading Buy Or Sell Bitcoin? Quant Reveals What Leading Metric Says 1 week ago The “short-term holders” (STHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. This cohort includes the new investors in the market, as well as the fickle-minded traders who make moves often and don’t tend to HODL. The investors who make it past the 155-day threshold are put inside the “long-term holders” (LTHs), which is a group that’s generally considered to reflect the resolute side of the sector. In the context of the current discussion, the investors of interest aren’t the ordinary STHs, but rather the humongous entities called whales. Formally, these investors are defined as those holding more than 1,000 BTC in their wallets. At the current exchange rate, this lower limit is worth $61.5 million, which is massive indeed. Whales can be influential beings on the network because of these large holdings, so their behavior can be something worth keeping an eye on. The STH whales would naturally correspond to the large holders who only bought within the past five months. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the exchange outflows being made by these new whales in the Bitcoin market over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been sharply going down in recent weeks | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin STH whale exchange outflows had spiked to pretty high levels earlier in the year, when the rally towards the new all-time high (ATH) price had taken place. Naturally, this spike would suggest demand for buying the cryptocurrency was high from new whale investors entering the space. At the peak, the indicator implied accumulation was occurring at the rate of a whopping 452,000 BTC per week. Related Reading Bitcoin Will Be Set For New ATHs If It Breaks This Resistance: Analyst 1 week ago A part of this buying would correspond to the demand coming in from the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – new investment vehicles for Bitcoin only approved at the start of this year that provide for an indirect way to invest into the asset in a format that may be preferrable for the more traditional investors. From the chart, it’s visible that the demand from the new whales has seen a clear decline in the period since the ATH, but accumulation nonetheless remains substantial as the STH whales are still potentially buying at a rate of around 200,000 BTC per week. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to be stagnant recently as its price is trading around $61,600 right now, still very much inside the range.

    "content": "In a new YouTube analysis released to his 502,000 followers, crypto strategist Miles Deutscher shared his insights on the evolving landscape of crypto investments. Deutscher’s discourse delved deep into the inefficacies of traditional venture capital (VC) investment models in the crypto space and proposed an alternative strategy focusing on certain altcoins which he believes are poised for significant growth. Deutscher criticized the conventional VC-backed token launches, stating, “VCs get in at super low valuations […] Then, when these tokens launch, they’re incentivized to launch them as high as possible in fully diluted valuation terms.” This practice, he argued, results in launch prices that are too steep, blocking effective price discovery mechanisms essential for healthy market participation by retail investors.The subsequent overvaluation typically leads to rapid price declines as initial investors quickly sell off their holdings to realize gains. Highlighting a shift in market dynamics, Deutscher pointed out that meme coins have gained popularity as a form of retaliation against the VC-dominated ecosystem. “People do feel like the game has been rigged and they want to gain an edge,” he explained. According to him, the success of meme coins can be attributed to their generally fairer launch processes compared to traditional VC-funded tokens. To 8 Altcoins To Buy Now Throughout his video, Deutscher listed eight altcoins that align with this new investment “meta,” emphasizing tokens that are “fully diluted and have equally good narratives.” Each coin is selected based on its tokenomics, Fully Diluted Valuation” (FDV), market position, and potential for growth without significant sell pressure from initial large holders: Related Reading BitMEX Founder Predicts The Dawn Of ‘Crypto Valhalla’: When Will It Start? 1 day ago Solana (SOL): Deutscher views Solana as a leader due to its technological prowess and significant community backing. It has shown resilience and innovation, making it one of his largest holdings due to consistent outperformance. “Solana has climbed to be one of my biggest holdings due to its outperformance. It’s a leader in the market for a reason, and congrats to everyone that’s gotten on board the Solana train with me.” Ton (TON): TON’s attractive FDV ratio suggests a stable market entry with less speculative risk compared to other high-valuation launches. Deutscher highlights its potential for growth without overwhelming sell pressure. He stated: “TON, being another layer one, is not just another blockchain. Okay, it’s relatively highly valued, but it’s mostly diluted in the market, which is good. Its FDV ratio is actually 68, so it’s a stable investment.” NEAR Protocol (NEAR): NEAR is emphasized as a strong AI proxy due to its technological foundation and leadership. Its high level of dilution (91% FDV) means most tokens are in circulation, reducing sell pressure. “NEAR comes in at a whopping 91% fully diluted, which means there isn’t much sell pressure. I do think NEAR is one of the top L1s, especially acting as a very strong AI proxy because the founder has his roots in AI,” Deutscher remarked. Injective Protocol (INJ): With a 94% market cap to FDV ratio, INJ is seen as having robust market health and less price suppression from unlocks. Deutscher believes it is poised for resurgence based on its strong fundamentals and recent market behaviors. “Injective has a 94% market cap to FDV ratio, which is really impressive and is one that outperformed earlier in the year but has just started to stagnate a bit. I think at some point, this is definitely going to rear its head again as a narrative,” he stated. Related Reading Cardano Founder Predicts Crypto As Election Game-Changer: Impact On Price 1 day ago Arweave (AR): Deutscher praises Arweave as one of the top infrastructure plays, not just for data storage but also for its potential integration with AI. The fact that it’s fully diluted means minimal sell pressure moving forward. “Arweave positions itself as one of the top infrastructure plays. It’s still not a crazy FDV at 3.1, considering it has a 100% circulating market cap, which means all of the unlocks have taken place.” AIOZ Network (AIOZ): AIOZ fits into the AI and decentralized content narrative with its unique offering in decentralized streaming and storage solutions. The fully diluted status of AIOZ tokens makes them particularly appealing.”AIOZ is another coin that is fully diluted in the market. It’s a coin in the deep tech/AI sector. I like what they’re building and it also includes decentralized storage, but also it’s decentralized AI compute network,” Deutscher explained. WIF: Dogwifhat’s fair launch process and full dilution are major pluses, helping it to achieve strong price performance without the usual VC-induced sell pressure, according to Deutscher. PEPE: Deutscher has personally seen substantial returns from Pepe, noting its recent “healthy cool off” as an opportune time for accumulation. The coin’s community-driven approach and meme status offer unique market resilience. “Pepe is another leading meme coin in my opinion. Very healthy cool off and one that I’m welcoming as someone that would like to get more exposure,” he revealed. High Potential Cryptos With Low Float, High FDV Deutscher also discussed the potential of investing in low float, high FDV tokens under specific conditions. Using Ondo Finance (ONDO) as a case study, he detailed how a deep understanding of tokenomics could reveal hidden opportunities. “ONDO’s vesting schedule is public, showing that most insiders are locked till 2025, minimizing sell pressure and allowing for price appreciation,” he noted. Concluding his analysis, Deutscher urged his viewers to adopt a nuanced investment strategy that leverages both market trends and in-depth token analysis. He emphasized the importance of buying during periods of “extreme fear” and selling during “extreme greed” to maximize returns. At press time, SOL traded at $183.33.

    "content": "Bitcoin is firm, recently trending above $71,200 and easing past local resistance levels, much to the delight of holders. However, the current leg up is just the beginning for Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst. Bitcoin Rally Getting Started: Analyst Taking to X, Woo, who has been maintaining a bullish outlook for the world’s most valuable coin, boldly asserts that the current Bitcoin rally is only halfway through its welcomed bullish journey. Sharing a chart, the on-chain analyst notes that the Bitcoin VWAP oscillator just bottomed up from oversold territory and is now at the zero mark, which is midway. Though Woo is upbeat and expecting even more gains, the analyst didn’t specify when or at what level prices will peak. Related Reading Shiba Inu Breaks Out Of Bull Flag Pattern-Like, Signaling Uptrend 20 hours ago Even so, the analyst explained that a period of consolidation below the all-time high is necessary. Woo says this consolidation might allow users to accumulate before a “second leg” propels the Bitcoin to new heights. Looking at the Bitcoin daily chart, this “second leg” is expected to be a breakout moment that will lift the coin above March highs. Bitcoin prices trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView At press time, Bitcoin is still in a bullish formation. The uptick above $68,000 and last week’s high were crucial for trend definition. Moreover, since the May 20 breakout bar is wide-ranging and has a high trading volume, the odds of trend continuation are high. If bulls follow through, confirming May 20 gains, BTC will likely break $73,800, aligning with Woo’s forecast. BTC Bull Run To Last 300 Days If There Is No Black Swan Event Besides Woo, another analyst says the Bitcoin uptrend is in full swing. Sharing a chart, the trader said that barring any unforeseen disruptions, such as the impact of a major exchange going bankrupt, it is highly likely that the current bull run will extend for another 300 days. Bitcoin uptrend is in full swing | Source: @AxelAdlerJr via X This prediction is based on profit and loss analysis of short-term holders (STHs) with a 90-day moving average. Currently, the STH is moving lower but is relatively higher. Analysts use the STH to determine market sentiment from short-term price movements and trader speculations.

    "content": "AI cryptos are on the march in 2024, with many taking flight in recent weeks to buck the trend of slumping prices across the crypto market. For instance, the Render price has surged by over 40% in the past week to break through the $10 barrier. After recently setting a new ATH of $13.15 in March, experts are examining how other AI cryptos, such as Bittensor, perform and whether we’re entering a new golden era led by AI. Render price is surging; is a new ATH in sight? Render has been on a roll in 2024, with the Render price steadily climbing. This platform uses GPUs to allow artists, creatives, and studios to render complicated 3D animations and visual effects through its decentralized community. Instead of investing in costly computing equipment, users can rent high-power processing equipment at a fraction of the cost. As one of the next-generation AI cryptos, Render has caught the imagination, with the Render price surging from $1.7128 twelve months ago to its current value of $10.67, an increase of over 400% in twelve months. As the AI crypto revolution gains pace, market analysts believe more gains could be around the corner as they forecast new ATHs for the Render price in the second half of 2024. Bittensor: Democratization across the AI data economy Another new generation of AI cryptos that will gain popularity in the first half of 2024 is Bittensor, with its unique decentralized platform where machine learning models can interact and learn from each other. Bittensor allows nodes, known as neurons, to share insights and data to improve algorithms through automated collaboration. Bittensor’s approach improves machine learning technologies through its new data economy model and boosts the decentralization of AI cryptos. Bittensor is trading at $390.81 at press time, up over 900% compared to a year ago when it was trading at just $37.9756. Experts believe Bittensor could return above the $700 mark it achieved as recently as March 2024 in the second half of this year. Raboo: Meme coin pioneer could be next of the breakout AI cryptos The surge in AI cryptos is causing more new projects to appear on the market. One of these is Raboo, a brand-new meme coin that combines AI meme generation with SocialFi mechanics, providing a new space for meme enthusiasts to grow a vibrant new crypto community. While using Raboo’s proprietary AI content generation technology, users can monetize their creations using the platform’s unique post-to-earn program. With over 5,000 members already signed up to the Raboo community, they can also gain rewards through competitions, prize draws, and regular airdrops. The Raboo presale is selling out rapidly, with the price already rising from $0.003 to $0.0042 at the time of writing. With over $1 million already raised, Raboo is a meme coin with genuine top-20 crypto prospects and 100x growth potential this year. Conclusion As AI cryptos push boundaries within the market, the Render price continues to surge, while Bittensor investors can look forward to future gains. However, the new meme coin prospect Raboo could be the best of the lot, given its 100x growth potential later this year. You can participate in the Raboo presale here.

    "content": "Crypto whales are making moves following the recent bear market. With Bitcoin increasing to $66,000, experts believe several projects could see significant rallies over the next few weeks. Three projects that have already caught whale attention are Chainlink, Rollblock, and Binance Coin (BNB). With all projects already in the green, experts believe they could see significant rallies, with Rollblock poised for returns of over 720%. Chainlink Passes 100% Annual Returns Chainlink’s impressive performance has continued in Q2, taking the altcoin’s annual returns to 107%. This milestone has triggered an influx of new investors, and Chainlink’s daily trading volume is up by 25.95% over the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, Chainlink was trading at $13.82 and boasted a market cap of $8.1 Billion. Since its launch in 2017, Chainlink has showcased exceptional growth, outperforming many of the market’s top cryptocurrencies. Following its recent rally, experts believe that Chainlink could pass $20 in 2024. As a result, crypto whales are doubling down on Chainlink (LINK) tokens to optimize their portfolios. Binance Successfully Implements New Security Protocol Binance recently implemented an “antidote” to the growing problem of address poisoning. This is when an investor is tricked into sending funds to a fraudulent address. This new algorithm has already been a huge success and has identified over 13.4 million spoofed addresses. This is a huge boost to the Binance Coin ecosystem. Given that crypto scams are on the rise, this development brings a much-needed sense of security to Binance Coin and the Binance Smart Chain. Since this update, Binance Coin’s price has increased by 2.29%, and Binance Coin (BNB) is now trading at $580.85. Having already experienced a strong performance in 2024, experts believe that Binance Coin (BNB) could be one of the market’s top cryptos in May. But how does Binance Coin compare to Rollblock? Why Are Crypto Whales Flocking to Rollblock? Rollblock is attracting cryptocurrency whales with its GambleFi protocol. This innovative project is one of the first to apply blockchain technology to the gambling industry, and its impact could be pivotal. By using blockchain technology, Rollblock is able to solve major industry issues such as transparency and security. Rollblock has already launched its casino, which showcases over 150 different games. The platform is fully licensed and will also introduce sports betting options over the next few months. These will cover major sports, including MMA, golf, boxing, soccer, and the NFL. One reason whales are buying Rollblock is its revenue share opportunity. Rollblock will share up to 30% of its daily revenue with $RBLK token holders. It will do this by using revenue to buy back $RBLK tokens on the open market, burning half of the tokens it buys. The remaining half will be used for staking rewards, offering some of the most lucrative passive income opportunities in the crypto market. This could become a great way for investors to build passive income streams and has been a key factor in Rollblock’s rapid growth. Currently in stage 2 of its presale, investors can buy $RBLK tokens for just $0.012. Experts believe tokens could increase in value by 720% during the Rollblock presale, and as a result, tokens are in high demand. Crypto Whales Take Advantage of Rollblock Returns Rollblock has a long-term roadmap in place, with big plans to pioneer developments in the gambling industry.

    "content": "Bitcoin price started a downside correction from the $72,000 zone. BTC is now consolidating near $70,000 and might eye another increase in the near term. Bitcoin struggled above the $71,800 resistance zone. The price is trading above $69,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $69,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase unless there is a move below $68,800. Bitcoin Price Corrects Gains Bitcoin price gained pace for a move above the $70,000 level. BTC even spiked above $71,200 before the bears appeared near $72,000. A new weekly high was formed at $71,896 and the price recently started a downside correction. The price declined below the $71,000 level and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $66,047 swing low to the $71,896 high.

    "content": "An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could be positioned for new all-time highs (ATHs) if it can break through this on-chain resistance level. Bitcoin On-Chain Data Could Suggest This Level Holds Major Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed Bitcoin’s current on-chain resistance. In on-chain analysis, the strength of support and resistance levels is based on the total amount of cryptocurrency last acquired at each level. Below is a chart for Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric, which shows the supply distribution across the various price levels based on where the investors bought their coins. How the cost basis distribution in the BTC market looks like at the moment | Source: @ali_charts on X From the graph, it’s visible that in terms of the levels currently ahead of the spot price, the $66,250 mark stands out as it hosts the cost basis of over 2% of all Bitcoin UTXOs. Generally, the cost basis is a special level for any investor, and they are naturally more likely to react when it is retested, as it can lead to a flip in their profit-loss situation. The spot price retesting a level won’t produce much reaction if only a few investors share their cost basis around the level. Still, if many holders bought there, the cryptocurrency could see visible effects upon a retest. Investors who are losing money may look forward to such a retest to exit out at their break-even point, as they may fear that the asset will fall back down again in the future, so getting away with their initial capital would seem like the ideal decision. As such, a retest of a level dense with UTXOs from below can lead to a selling reaction in the market, making these levels points of strong resistance for Bitcoin. Since the $66,250 level appears to be where the most coins were purchased out of the levels ahead, this level could be the toughest one to break for the cryptocurrency. On the brighter side, though, the levels after this point are relatively thin. “Once BTC breaks past this level, it will be positioned for new all-time highs!” explains the analyst. The market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has also discussed about on-chain cost basis distribution in an X post today. As revealed by the firm, around 10% of all addresses acquired their coins between the current spot price and the all-time high the asset set back in March. Looks like a large amount of supply was purchased at the levels near the ATH | Source: IntoTheBlock on X This would naturally mean that 10% of the total addresses, equivalent to 5.16 million, are in the red on the Bitcoin network. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to move in its recent range, with its price currently trading around the $62,800 level.

    "content": "While top DeFi token, Solana, continues to recover in the broader market, SOL bulls are reeling with optimism, with many expecting the token to reach $200. Meanwhile, Rollblock (RBLK) has sparked excitement among traders and crypto enthusiasts after the announcement of its unique revenue-sharing model. Rollblock’s (RBLK) New Revenue-Sharing Sparks Excitement Among Traders Rollblock’s emergence into the cryptocurrency market has sparked interest among traders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Currently, in its presale’s second stage, Rollblock (RBLK) has demonstrated enormous potential, promising users and buyers incredible returns. Its ecosystem presents a roadmap unlike no other, gearing to change the narrative in the casino world. Unlike its traditional rivals, Rollblock offers a smooth sign-up process, prioritizing user privacy and convenience in today’s digital world. In addition, its incorporation of cryptocurrency as well as seamless onboarding process draws diverse users across the crypto market, especially with no need for KYC verification or extra downloads. Furthermore, Rollblock introduces a unique revenue-sharing model that could potentially change the dynamics in the GameFi market. While trying to repurchase $RBLK tokens from the open market, the Rollblock network sets aside up to 30% of its weekly revenue to achieve this. Furthermore, Rollblock’s token-burn feature ensures that 50% of repurchased tokens are removed from the market, while the other half goes to staking rewards. Meanwhile, the native RBLK token currently trades for $0.012 per token, which reflects 20% increase from an initial offering price of $0.01 as well as heightened buyer interes. As it awaits its listing on a major crypto exchange, market experts are touting Rollblock to soar to the top, making it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy this year. Solana Bulls Highly Optimistic With $200 Projection One of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the market, Solana (SOL) has proven time and again to be a formidable player in the crypto space. Notably, Solana is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to resolve scalability concerns in the crypto market by introducing proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism. Besides its unique features, Solana has also demonstrated exceptional strength in the broader DeFi market. In the last year, Solana has surged over 760%, demonstrating its resilience despite the bear market. Currently trading at a weekly price range between $146.8 and $178.6, SOL token has shown signs of recovery with analysts projecting a resurgence for the token. Furthermore, Solana network’s success can be partly attributed to emergence of meme coins on the Solana blockchain. With tokens like Dogwifhat and Bonk taking centerstage, there has been a growing interest in the Solana network as a whole. Moreso, while this has spurred optimism, analysts are projecting Solana to soar and reach the $200 mark very soon. With its current mass adoption and growing market cap, Solana maintains a solid spot among top Defi tokens in the crypto market. Can Rollblock Become As Successful As Solana in the Altcoin Market? Rollblock’s ascent in the crypto market has been quite commendable, with the token exploding into the scene without much hassle. This is a result of its innovative features and distinct roadmap which give it an edge over other new tokens. With its current trajectory, market experts are touting it to mirror and surpass some of the top DeFi tokens in the market.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The global crypto adoption rate remains unsatisfactory and efforts are on to bring more people into web3. In this session, we’re interviewing Herbert Sim,\n\n",
    "content": "The global crypto adoption rate remains unsatisfactory and efforts are on to bring more people into web3. In this session, we’re interviewing Herbert Sim, COO of the digital asset trading platform, Websea, where he shares his insights about web3 adoption. Q. Hello. Would you please introduce yourself and share your professional journey with our readers? Hi, I’m Herbert and it’s wonderful to be here. I’m currently the COO of Websea, a youth-focused web3 digital asset trading platform. Before Websea, I worked as the Global Operations Director at Huobi Global and Chief Marketing Officer at Cryptology Exchange. So I’ve been in operational management in the FinTech sector for a fairly long time. Most people know me as ‘The Bitcoin Man’ for my work as an angel investor and advisor for crypto projects. The Bitcoin Man is now a venture capital fund where I continue to invest and incubate promising startups. I’m also the founder of Crypto Chain University (CCU), a non-profit institute and digital repository for blockchain research and policy-oriented work. CCU is a passion project and comes from my desire to make web3 accessible to people. I believe the web3 sector has much to do to bring decentralized protocols to the masses. So I continue to work hard to realize the vision of ‘onboarding the next billion’ to crypto. Q. Why do you think the web3 industry hasn’t yet reached mass crypto adoption? What does the industry need to do to bring more people into web3? In my opinion, the biggest problem is the lack of easy-to-use, smooth, and efficient web3 protocols with an engaging user interface. We can’t expect newcomers to navigate complicated apps to store or use digital assets daily. So web2 users need a seamless transition to web3 protocols where they don’t require any technical knowledge to operate the apps. Moreover, web3 apps must integrate attractive features and financial incentives to appeal to first-time users. For instance, crypto exchanges function as the main gateway to enter web3 for investing and trading in crypto and NFTs. These exchanges serve as the primary circulation hubs for the digital asset economy to transact globally without any restrictions. However, most crypto exchanges have a difficult user interface that doesn’t appeal to new users. Thus we need more exchanges that can conveniently provide digital asset services and remain integrated with the wider web3 economy. Once we have engaging web3 protocols, people from diverse demographics will start joining the crypto world. Q. Who do you think will be the primary driver of crypto adoption in the next decade? Can you elaborate on the reasons? I think the digital asset economy is conducive for people of all age groups and across geographical borders. If you look at statistical reports, there has been an almost 200% growth in global crypto users with Asian and African countries dominating the Crypto Adoption Index. But once you probe further, you’ll see that young people are the main drivers in the crypto space and will continue to do so. A Coinbase report states that 31% of young people own crypto compared to just 12% of older people. Further, 38% of youth believe that crypto is the future of finance compared to 28% of the older generation. There are multiple reasons why Millennials and Gen Z prefer crypto assets. To begin with, they’re digital natives who organically grew up with the Internet. But other socio-economic factors are working as well. Millennials have faced student debts, rising housing costs, inflation, and the 2008 financial crisis. Thus, rather than trusting centralized banks or government-backed national currencies, they’re more open to alternative finance like crypto. The Great Wealth Transfer will happen over the next few decades where Millennials and Gen Z will inherit around $84 trillion. A Galaxy Research report states that $160-$225 billion would come into crypto markets from younger generations if the Wealth Transfer happened today. When the Transfer is complete by 2045, crypto can record a daily incremental buying pressure of around $20-$28 million. That is why I’m building Websea, a digital asset ecosystem that specifically focuses on young investors. Q. Tell us more about Websea. How do you intend to cater to a young audience with your platform? Websea is a digital asset trading platform exclusively customized for the global youth. Our platform offers a dual account system with centralized and decentralized asset custody models. We have an integrated AI system for risk mitigation, fraud prevention, predictive trading analytics, and strategy recommendations. The WBS token powers our Websea platform. WBS has a total supply of 300 million tokens with 60% allocated for community incentives. The rest is for long-term platform development with a multi-year lock-up period. We follow an X-To-Earn tokenomics model where users can play, trade, browse, stake, contribute, and create to earn tokens. To answer your second question, Websea offers gamified features for an engaging and entertaining trading experience for our young audience. We also have options like Boost to Bargain, Invitation Red Packet rewards, Lucky Box awards, and Group Boosts. These financial incentives help us consolidate our platform and organically expand our user base. Websea is also focussing on building a gaming ecosystem to cater to the youth and will incubate GameFi projects. Q. We’re currently going through a bull market where hype and speculation dominate crypto trading. However, the bear market brings a huge slump. So what do you think about this cycle and its impact on the crypto trading industry? How do you think the youth will shape this space in the coming years? I consider that the bull market hype brings new investors to the crypto industry. So there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with speculative trading during a bull run. Plus, the stock market also goes through cycles so it’s only natural for the crypto market to go through the same. Let me explain this with an example. The Runes hype has brought huge attention to Bitcoin and will provide an impetus to Bitcoin DeFi in the long run. However, as of April, two-thirds of the top 50 Runes are in the red, which means investors are not seeing any immediate profits. People usually blame young investors for having fun with memecoins and making the crypto space akin to gambling. But even Vitalik Buterin thinks such practices are not entirely bad. He recently said, “If people value having fun, and financialized games seem to at least sometimes provide that, then could there be a more positive-sum version…?” I’ll echo Buterin’s statement and say that young investors know what they’re doing and how they want to manage their finances. So even if they’re having fun with meme coins or investing seriously in BTC or ETH, they know the game. That is why I think the youth will drive global crypto adoption and make the web3 space more valuable and utility-driven in the future. Image: Websea Medium Blog\n\n",

    "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been on a hot streak in the past few days, with several large-cap assets posting significant gains in the past week. Most notably, the Bitcoin price bounced back from around $61,000 to above $67,000 for the first time in nearly a month. As expected, this latest price movement has sparked a lot of speculation and discussion around the premier cryptocurrency. Popular blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant has shared on-chain insights into the recent Bitcoin price rally and its future trajectory. How Did Bitcoin Price Reach $67,000? In a recent report, CryptoQuant revealed the catalyst and on-chain manifestations behind BTC’s latest rally to above $67,000. According to the analytics firm, the price of Bitcoin rode to its new highs on the back of the news of lower-than-expected inflation in the United States.

This revelation suggested that inflation might be on a downward slope in the US, making risky assets like Bitcoin more attractive. ? #Bitcoin\u0027s price has rallied from $60K to around $66K, driven by lower-than-expected US inflation and reduced selling pressure. Let\u0027s look into the details ?? — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 17, 2024 In its report, CryptoQuant revealed that there has been a decreased selling pressure in the BTC market, as short-term holders are selling at low or negative profits. Meanwhile, Bitcoin balances at over-the-counter (OTC) desks have steadied, implying that fewer coins are entering the open market. What’s more, the analytics platform highlighted a particular on-chain signal that might have predicted the recent Bitcoin price rally. According to CryptoQuant, BTC miners have been extremely underpaid over the past few weeks, which often correlates with price bottoms. The Catalysts For Sustained BTC Rally? CryptoQuant, in its report, identified potential catalysts for a continued rally for the Bitcoin price. According to the on-chain data company, demand from permanent holders and largest investors is on the rise but it needs to climb rapidly to push the price of BTC even higher. Related Reading Crypto Post-Mortem: Here’s How Pump.Fun Was Exploited For $2 Million 4 days ago Furthermore, the latest data shows that Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded funds) purchases have dwindled to nearly zero daily, while stablecoin liquidity growth is also on a decline. CryptoQuant noted that these two metrics need a jolt, which might be critical for a sustained Bitcoin rally. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price continues to hover around $67,000, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency is up by a significant 10% in the past week.

    "content": "Meme coins have become a huge part of the crypto community in recent years, with more than 50 launched in the past year. Two networks that are currently hosting meme coins include Solana and Binance Smart Chain. The question now is which of them will dominate the meme coin cycle in the coming months. In other news, Rollblock has become one of the best DeFi projects after introducing a new GambleFi protocol. The blockchain casino game is getting a huge number of followers, and analysts are optimistic that this trend will go on. Solana (SOL) Becomes One of the Best Chains for Meme coins In the past few years, a myriad of memecoins has flooded the Solana (SOL) blockchain, with names like Dogwifhat, Bonk, and Book of Memes among the top meme coins. The Solana blockchain has been a bedrock for these meme coins, offering them fast transactions and top-notch security. At the moment, three of its meme coins – Dogwifhat, Bonk, and Book of Memes are part of the top 10 meme coins in the market. New memecoins are expected to join the Solana network in the coming months. Binance Smart Chain (BNB) Yet To Gain Grounds in the Meme Coin Market Compared to Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BNB) is still grasping at straws in the meme coin space. Some of the notable memecoins that have been launched on the Binance Smart Chain network are Rich Quack, SafeMoon, and Memecoin. Of these three, only one Memecoin is part of the top 10. The others are still struggling to gain momentum. Earlier this year, Binance Labs invested in Memecoin to develop the Memeland ecosystem. At the moment, there has not been much memecoin activity on the Binance Smart Chain network. Rollblock (RBLK) Projected To Dominate the DeFi Market Rollblock (RBLK) is shaking up the online casino gaming sector as the next big thing in the DeFi market. It is licensed and secure, offering players peace of mind without the hassle of KYC checks. Unlike others, Rollblock shares its success with RBLK token holders, giving them a chance to earn up to 30% of the casino’s weekly revenue. The project buys back tokens from the market using its generated revenue. Whatever the number of these tokens is, 50% of it is then burned, and the other 50% is given as staking rewards to the Rollblock community. The positioning of RBLK in the online gambling market, which is expected to reach $744 billion by 2028, makes it the best coin to invest in. Rollblock is a fully licensed operator that guarantees the safety of the players and, at the same time, gets a global audience. Besides, it contains state-of-the-art encryption and blockchain technology. Players need not be afraid while using the platform, as their data is safe and secured. Now, the RBLK token of Rollblock is in its second presale stage, and it is priced at only $0.012. It is the best coin to invest in because of the advantages it provides within the system. RBLK is a tool for getting into games and doing transactions on the platform. To sum up, RBLK is a great crypto for traders who are aiming to increase their profits in the next few months. Conclusion Solana’s speed, security, and low fees are the reasons why it has become one of the preferred networks for meme coins. Contrarily, Binance Smart Chain is still fighting to break through the meme coin market. Its memecoins are far behind the SOL-based memecoins. In the meantime, Rollblock is gaining popularity in the DeFi market because of its new DeFi project that aims to revolutionize the casino industry. Investors who are in search of a fully licensed casino platform to play casino games and make money can join Rollblock by buying the RBLK token.The price of RBLK is expected to increase by over 800% in the presale alone.

According to the analyst, the MVRV ratio for those who have held BTC for between 1 and 3 months has climbed above 66,500. This expansion means they have exited the “unrealized loss” zone, signaling a shift in sentiment among short-term holders. At spot rates and prices trading above $66,700, above the $66,500 level, HODLers are in the green and can exit for a profit or HODL. Bitcoin Finds Strong Support Above $60,000 It remains to be seen how prices will react in the short to medium term. However, another analyst notes that over 530,000 BTC was traded at $66,250. Accordingly, this line is turning out to be a strong, reliable support. If bulls soak in the selling pressure, the line at $66,250 can act as a reliable anchor for the next leg up toward an all-time high.

    "content": "The Bitcoin Halving event is now one month behind us, but the market is still waiting for solid signs of recovery. To attest to this is the fact that the Binance coin has seen a significant decrease in value, further adding fuel to the fire on the market. Right now it’s sitting at $569, which is a 5% decrease compared to last week, highlighting major underperformance compared to the global cryptocurrency market. However, you can still make profits in this bearish environment. Top market experts are saying that the future is in the meme coin market. More specifically in Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), and WienerAI ($WAI) projects. Let’s check out the details. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Binance Coin (BNB) Has Seen Significant Drops in the Past Week – These Hot New Presales Could Save the Day The forefront of the market has long been occupied by BNB, thanks to its close ties with Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. It used to be seen as one of the most stable coins, with minimal price fluctuations. However, recent times have seen a significant shift. Binance Coin experienced substantial drops over the past week, plummeting well below the $600 mark. One contributing factor to this sudden downturn is the recent series of major crypto-related arrests. Ontario’s ‘’Crypto King’’, Aiden Pleterski, was arrested on fraud charges following an 18-month investigation. Authorities found evidence of money laundering using investor funds. Similarly, two US citizens were apprehended for a lightning-fast theft totaling over $25 million. The brothers Anton and James Peraire-Bueno, aided by corrupt IRS agents, allegedly engaged in money fraud and wire laundering. If found guilty, they could face up to 20 years in prison. Despite these setbacks, there are still profit opportunities, especially in the booming meme coin market. Analysts are pointing to new presales as the next big thing, with tokens like Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), WienerAI ($WAI), and Sealana ($SEAL) showing potential for x100 returns. Let’s see the details of each token below. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) Brings New Innovation to the Market as the First Multi-chain Token Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) stands out as the pioneer in multi-blockchain functionality among coins. Its groundbreaking technology seamlessly integrates across 6 major blockchains, a feat never seen before in the crypto realm. Inspired by the successful models of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Dogeverse adopts the beloved dog avatar concept, featuring a quirky space doge navigating the vast crypto landscapes. This character symbolizes the freedom and agility within the crypto space, effortlessly moving between blockchains. The presale phase of Dogeverse witnessed unprecedented success, raking in millions shortly after its ICO launch in April. As of now, the project has amassed over $15 million and is rapidly approaching its hard cap of $17 million, signaling the high demand and investor interest. One of Dogeverse’s strengths is its strong community support, boasting nearly 20,000 followers on X. This massive following is not surprising, given that 25% of the total 200 billion tokens are dedicated to marketing, ensuring widespread visibility and engagement. Investors opting to stake $DOGEVERSE tokens can enjoy various rewards and benefits, with annual percentage yields reaching up to 72% Currently priced at $0.00031 per coin, buying $DOGEVERSE tokens at this stage presents a favorable opportunity, especially considering the anticipated exponential surge in price post-listing. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Dogeverse Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Sealana ($SEAL) is the Future for Solana Based Meme Coins With a Familiar Mascot and Successful ICO Sealana ($SEAL) is a plump seal diving deep into the Solana Sea’s mysteries. He’s glued to his PC, growing larger by the day, fueled by chips and canned tuna. His obsession? Finding the best Solana meme coins, keeping his flippers busy. Inspired by South Park’s World of Warcraft episode, Sealana is the newest SOL meme coin with a ‘Send to Wallet’ presale. Rumor has it that it’s from the same creators behind the viral SLERF token that blew up in March 2024. To get $SEAL, you can use the website widget or send SOL directly to the presale wallet. After the presale, you’ll get token airdrops. Right now, $SEAL is a steal at $0.022, but prices will rise during the presale. It’s smart to get in early. And if you’re sending tokens to Sealana’s wallet, use a DEX wallet to qualify for the airdrop. But what really sets Sealana apart is its community. Unlike other projects, $SEAL fans are active and engaged, sharing memes and insights. This lively atmosphere makes Sealana more than just a meme coin—it’s a community-driven adventure in the crypto world. In short, Sealana isn’t just riding the hype; it’s a symbol of community, innovation, and a bit of seal spirit. Whether you’re a crypto pro or just curious, consider joining Sealana’s journey and see where it takes you in the Solana Sea. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Sealana Now \u003c\u003c\u003c WienerAI ($WAI) is the Next Big Doge-Themed Token Aiming to Combine Crypto and AI WienerAI ($WAI) emerges as the next-gen doge-themed token, integrating cutting-edge AI technology into its framework. Currently, in its presale phase, WienerAI is set to undergo multiple stages. In the ongoing phase, investors can acquire 1 $WAI for $0.000707. This phase is swiftly approaching its conclusion, having already raised close to $2 million within just a month. With only $150,000 remaining to bridge the gap, the next phase promises significant price escalations. Staking is a pivotal aspect of WienerAI, offering generous rewards for token holders. While it’s expected that APYs will decrease as more users adopt the token, early investors stand to benefit from this advantageous opportunity. Down the road, WienerAI plans to integrate an AI bot into its platform, enhancing trade predictions and overall functionality. This forward-looking approach adds another layer of appeal for potential investors interested in the project’s long-term vision and innovation. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Wiener AI Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Conclusion The recent market dip of the famous Binance coin has left investors feeling uneasy about their future finances. However, many experts are optimistic that there are still big profits to be made, more notably in the meme coin market. If you want to jump on the opportunity early, top analysts recommend considering investments in Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), WienerAI ($WAI), and Sealana ($SEAL). Grab these tokens before prices skyrocket after the presale ends. Being among the first to invest could lead to significant gains as these tokens will surely gain traction in the market.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "In his latest essay titled “The Easy Button,” Arthur Hayes, predicts the dawn of \u0027Crypto Valhalla.\u0027 Here\u0027s when!\n\n",
    "content": "In his latest essay titled “The Easy Button,” Arthur Hayes, founder of the crypto exchange BitMEX, delves into the dynamics of global monetary policies and their consequential ties to what he describes as the impending ‘Crypto Valhalla.’ Hayes analyzes the policy maneuvers of the world’s major economies, notably Japan, the United States, and China, and their effects on the crypto landscape. The Dawn Of Crypto Valhalla Hayes outlines the Federal Reserve’s potential strategy in coordination with the US Treasury to engage in unlimited dollar-for-yen swaps with the Bank of Japan (BOJ). This measure aims to manipulate exchange rates to stabilize the yen without causing disruptive economic shifts. Hayes states, “The Fed, acting on orders from the Treasury, can legally swap dollars for yen in unlimited amounts for as long as they wish with the BOJ.” This tactic, according to Hayes, is designed to avert immediate financial crises by deferring hard economic decisions. Related Reading Crypto Analyst Sounds Warning Alarm For Potential 50-60% Crash In Chainlink Price, Here’s Why 1 day ago The implications for Japan’s economy are stark, with Hayes predicting severe consequences should the BOJ decide to raise interest rates: “If the BOJ raises interest rates, it commits seppuku,” Hayes notes, using the Japanese term for ritual suicide to underscore the potential self-destructive economic impact, given that the BOJ is the largest holder of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) and would incur massive losses. The devaluation of the yen has also significant ramifications for China’s global economic competitiveness, especially in exports. Hayes discusses how a weaker yen harms China’s export economy by making Japanese goods cheaper internationally, directly competing with Chinese products. He suggests that the People’s Bank of China might respond by devaluing the yuan to maintain competitive balance. “If the yen keeps weakening, China will respond by devaluing the yuan,” Hayes predicts, outlining a potential economic tit-for-tat that could destabilize global markets. Hayes further theorizes about a dramatic monetary policy shift in China involving its substantial gold reserves. He posits that China could use these reserves to peg the yuan to gold, thereby creating a new economic landscape. “China is estimated to have stockpiled over 31,000 tonnes of gold […] I believe that for domestic and foreign political reasons, China wishes to keep the dollar-yuan rate stable.” By pegging the yuan to gold, China could potentially insulate itself from currency fluctuations and exert greater control over its economic destiny. The essay also touches on the intersection of US politics and economic policy, particularly in light of the approaching presidential election. Hayes speculates that domestic economic pressures, such as job losses and the reshoring of manufacturing, could significantly influence the Biden administration’s policy decisions. Related Reading Cardano Founder Predicts Crypto As Election Game-Changer: Impact On Price 1 day ago He argues that the administration may avoid aggressive moves against China to prevent a backlash in pivotal states: “Biden must win these battleground states to keep the Orange Man at bay. Biden cannot afford a yuan devaluation before the election.” Hayes suggests that these global currency maneuvers could lead to a bullish scenario for cryptocurrencies. He advises crypto traders and institutional investors to monitor the USDJPY exchange rate closely, asserting that significant movements could indicate shifts favorable to crypto valuations. “Watch the USDJPY rate closer than Solana devs monitor uptime,” he advises, highlighting the potential for substantial financial opportunities in the cryptocurrency space.On the timing of a potential “Crypto Valhalla,” Hayes speculates that the pace of yen depreciation will accelerate into the fall. “This will put pressure on the US, Japan, and China to do something. The US election is a crucial motivating factor for the Biden administration to come up with some solution.” According to Hayes, a USDJPY surge towards 200 is “enough to put on the Chemical Brothers and ‘Push the Button.’ This analogy to the Chemical Brothers’ song underscores the urgency and drastic nature of the action required to counter such a currency imbalance. “If my theory becomes reality, it is trivial for any institutional investor to buy one of the US-listed Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin is the best-performing asset in the face of global fiat debasement, and they know it. When something is done about the weak yen, I will mathematically guestimate how flows into the Bitcoin complex will ratchet the price to $1 million and possibly beyond. Stay imaginative, stay boolish, now is not the time to be a cuck,” Hayes concludes. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $70,835.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Analyst@tedtalksmacro provides compelling evidence to support his assertion that the current Bitcoin bull run is far from over.\n\n",
    "content": "In an analysis shared via X, renowned crypto analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) has provided compelling evidence to support his assertion that the current Bitcoin bull run is far from over. Ted’s insights are based on four critical indicators related to traditional finance and crypto liquidity, each pointing to sustained growth in the near future. Here’s a breakdown of his analysis: #1 65-Month Liquidity Cycle Ted highlights the 65-month liquidity cycle, a historical pattern that marks the ebb and flow of liquidity in financial markets. According to his analysis, this cycle bottomed out in October 2023, signaling the beginning of a new expansion phase. Related Reading Most Important Bitcoin Indicator Nears Bullish Flip: $150,000 Soon? 6 days ago “We are now in the expansion phase, which is expected to peak in 2026,” Ted stated. This projection aligns with the anticipated easing by central banks in response to slowing economic data over the next 18 to 24 months. Historically, increased liquidity has been a precursor to bull markets in various asset classes, including Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. 65 month liquidity cycle | Source: @tedtalksmacro #2 M2 Money Supply The M2 money supply, which includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money, is another crucial indicator, if not the most important indicator of global liquidity. Ted notes that the rate of expansion in the M2 money supply is at its lowest since the 1990s. “There is plenty of room to the upside for easing liquidity conditions,” he explained. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies to stimulate economies, increased M2 growth could lead to more capital flowing into risk assets like Bitcoin. M2 money supply | Source: @tedtalksmacro #3 Crypto Liquidity While liquidity has returned to the crypto markets, particularly with the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ted points out that the velocity of inflows has not yet reached the levels seen at cycle tops. “The velocity of inflow has not yet seen a manic phase consistent with cycle tops,” he noted. Related Reading Tether Adds Fresh $1 Billion USDT To Supply – Bitcoin To Rally Again? 3 days ago This suggests that while interest and investment in Bitcoin are growing, the market has not yet reached the speculative frenzy that typically precedes a major correction. This phase of measured inflow can provide a more stable foundation for continued price increases. Crypto liquidity | Source: @tedtalksmacro #4 Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows The US based spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant inflows, with last week alone witnessing $950 million flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, the largest net inflow since March. Ted expects these inflows to increase as Bitcoin’s price rises and traditional finance investors regain confidence in the asset. “Expect these to only increase as price drifts higher and tradFi once again renew faith in the asset,” he stated. The growing acceptance and investment from institutional investors via ETFs are a strong bullish indicator for Bitcoin’s continued ascent. Spot Bitcoin ETF flows | Source: @tedtalksmacro Each of these factors points to a sustained and robust bull market for Bitcoin. Ted’s analysis, grounded in traditional financial indicators and crypto-specific data, provides a comprehensive outlook on the current and future state of the Bitcoin market. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies and institutional interest continues to grow, the conditions appear ripe for Bitcoin’s bull run to extend well into the coming years.

    "content": "According to the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, Bitcoin is moving inside a range. BTC is also down roughly 20% from the all-time high at spot rates. Though the series of lower lows posted in the past few trading days is bearish, one analyst is upbeat, expecting an encouraging recovery in the sessions ahead. This Indicator Flashes Green: Time For Bitcoin To Rally? Taking to X, the analyst notes that the 50-day Williams %R oscillator is turning from oversold territory, signaling that the bear run could end. Historically, the indicator has accurately signaled buying opportunities whenever it turns from oversold territory. 50-day Williams oscillator on BTC chart | Source: Analyst on X The Williams %R oscillator is a crucial technical indicator chartists use to assess momentum and identify potential oversold or overbought conditions. When the indicator falls below -80, it suggests the asset being analyzed is oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. Conversely, when it rises above +20, it may mean that the asset is overbought, prompting the trader to adjust their strategy accordingly. Related Reading Newbie Bitcoin Whales Buying 200,000 BTC Per Week, Data Shows 1 week ago Since the beginning of 2023, the analyst observes that the 50-day Williams %R oscillator mapping Bitcoin prices has dipped into oversold territory on four occasions. Notably, each time the oscillator reversed from this zone, BTC prices rose in tandem. Now, with the Williams %R oscillator returning from the oversold territory roughly ten days ago, the analyst is optimistic. It returned from the oversold territory in January 2024, preceding the bull run in Q1 2024. If past performance is anything to go by, BTC is likely ready for a leg up. Considering the extended sideways movement and lower lows since prices peaked in mid-March 2024, this development will be a massive boost for the coin. Does BTC Stand A Chance After Extended Consolidation? The asset has become more dynamic since the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Broader market conditions, such as regulatory changes, macroeconomic trends, and investor sentiment increasingly influence it. Subsequently, this dynamism can impact the accuracy of technical indicators like the Williams % R oscillator. This tool lags and doesn’t factor in events in real time. Therefore, while the oscillator has been reliable in the past, it may not necessarily accurately predict the future cycle.

    "content": "The U.S. House of Representatives is on the verge of a vote on Wednesday that is widely expected to approve comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation with bipartisan support – a major milestone for the industry – and several Democrats there are pushing their colleagues to vote yes.\n\nAt least eight House Democrats were vocally supporting the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) – and they may recruit more – according to a memo shared with CoinDesk by a congressional aide. At this point, the bill is scheduled for floor discussion and a vote later in the day on Wednesday.\n\n\"As Democrats, we feel this is a crucial opportunity to regulate the digital asset markets,\" the eight lawmakers wrote in the internal memo Tuesday asking support from their colleagues. \"This should not be a partisan issue,\" according to the lawmakers, including Reps. Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.), Yadira Caraveo (D-Colo.), Jim Himes (D-Conn.), Jasmine Crockett (D-Tex.), Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), Darren Soto (D-Fla.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Don Davis (D-N.C.).\n\nBut despite fans on both sides of the aisle in the House, the effort further highlights the lack of similar progress in the Senate, where the crypto market-structure legislation could fizzle. To that end, senior staff of the House Financial Services and Agriculture committees working on the bill said Tuesday that they\u0027re having increasing discussions with Senate counterparts but are also open to legislative vehicles the bill could eventually be attached to as this congressional session winds toward its close.\n\n\"What we want is to have a substantial vote total this week in the House that will show momentum,\" said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee who has shepherded the bill in the retiring lawmaker\u0027s final months in Congress. He lamented to reporters on Tuesday that the effort that was meant to happen almost a year ago was delayed this long. \"We\u0027re now in May of an election year.\"\n\nStill, he said his fellow lawmakers now have an \"awareness\" of the existence of crypto voters, too, and \"that is supportive of our efforts.\"\n\nFIT21 would establish a clear framework for digital assets in the U.S., identifying where and how each token and exchange might be regulated. It establishes consumer protections, disclosures and addresses the use of crypto in illicit finance. The vote on the bill represents the first time such a comprehensive piece of crypto legislation has reached a final decision in either chamber of Congress.\n\nRead More: Crypto Industry Rallies Behind House Bill as It Heads Toward Final Vote\n\nThe Democratic advocates made a case for stepping in to police the crypto markets, where the leading businesses are waging a multi-front legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over how much authority that regulator rightfully has. The lawmakers also argued that the U.S. is falling behind other jurisdictions that have already instituted rules for the industry.\n\n\"Roughly 20% of Americans have invested, traded, or used crypto, so it’s not going anywhere,\" according to the Democrats\u0027 memo. \"Meanwhile, Congress hasn’t passed legislation to usher in this new generation of internet technology responsibly.\"\n\nThe House\u0027s digital assets legislation isn\u0027t yet facing any White House promises for a veto, unlike the recent vote in the Senate that saw a large number of Democrats join all the Republicans to approve a resolution to reverse an SEC crypto account policy – Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121).\n\nRepublican aides said they expect some of the same 21 Democratic names who voted in the House to overturn SAB 121 might also support this bill.\n\nFIT21 has previously cleared its two relevant House committees with some Democratic support.\n\nHouse Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member David Scott (D-Ga.) – the leading Democrats on their respective panels – sent their own email to fellow Democrats saying they still \"strongly oppose\" the effort, but they won\u0027t organize any voting against it, Politico previously reported.\n\nConsumer advocates including Americans for Financial Reform argued against the bill, too, saying it didn\u0027t sufficiently protect consumers and uses an \"easily manipulated definition\" of decentralization when deciding how things should be regulated.\n\nRep. Glenn \"G.T.\" Thompson (R-Pa.), chairman of the Agriculture Committee, told reporters that passing legislation is urgent, because the current state of regulation has driven crypto business away from the U.S.\n\n\"Right now, most of them are parked somewhere offshore, because the only regulatory structure they see is regulation by enforcement,\" he said.\n\nIn the Senate, a wide-ranging bill from Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is currently the closest equivalent to FIT21, and the House aides said that talks are underway about the topics on which those bills find common ground.\n\nRashan Colbert, head of policy at dYdX Trading and a former legislative assistant to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), noted that the bill has been working its way through the House for a year and a half.\n\n\"[For] the Senate to take this up, [starting] with the committee process to go through, that would be needed to really consider this bill in full,\" he said. \"So unfortunately, I think that there\u0027s not a great chance of Senate consideration this Congress.\"\n\nOne of the key components to iron out would be funding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which would have a much more significant and defined role in policing the crypto spot markets but currently has a tiny fraction of its sister agency\u0027s budget.\n\nRead more: Democrat House Leadership Says Crypto Bill Vote Won\u0027t Be Whipped\n\nNikhilesh De contributed reporting.\n\nUPDATE (May 21, 2024, 19:48 UTC): Adds comment from Americans for Financial Reform.\n\n",

    "content": "A bunch of Ethereum ecosystem tokens rocketed in the past 24 hours after two Bloomberg analysts raised their odds on the approval of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.\n\nThe cat-themed mog (MOG) token, a reference to a popular TikTok meme, rose nearly 50% while the frog-themed pepe (PEPE) surged more than 20%. Both were initially issued on Ethereum in 2023 and have since become mainstays, alongside bigger ones such as dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB).\n\nAmong utility projects, staking application Lido’s LDO rose 15%, while the ARB token of Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Arbitrum jumped 18%. DOGE and SHIB added 6%.\n\nMeme tokens have been increasingly seen as a leveraged way to bet on the growth of their underlying blockchain. The gains came after Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart updated the odds of approval to 75% from 20% on Monday, causing a market-wide jump. Ether rose over 17%, while bitcoin retook the $71,000 mark for the first time since early April.\n\n“Established memes are generally high beta for the native token of the chain they’re on, and Mog has established itself as a winner on Ethereum while still trading at a fraction of the next biggest meme (Pepe),” a Mog core team member said in an interview over Telegram.\n\n“I think the market sees that there’s quite a lot of room to catch up to Pepe, and that’s why you see the outperformance. If you think memes are good beta; you’ll go for the higher caps like pepe or you’ll slide further down the curve for mog.”\n\nThe focus on meme coins as a way of betting on growth isn\u0027t unique to Ethereum. Several Solana-based meme coin tokens surged from December to March as the network’s SOL tokens took off – contributing to ecosystem growth and attention. Also in December, the Avalanche Foundation, a non-profit that maintains the Avalanche blockchain, said it would invest in meme tokens built on the network in recognition of the online culture and memetic value that such tokens can drive among investors.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "The ratio between ether (ETH) and bitcoin’s (BTC) dollar-denominated prices continues to slide, extending year-to-date losses as suggested by the bearish death cross pattern a month ago.\n\nETH/BTC slipped to 0.04563 on crypto exchange Binance soon before press time, reaching the lowest since April 2021, according to charting platform TradingView. This year, the ratio has declined nearly 16%, indicating a bias for bitcoin or the leading cryptocurrency by market value.\n\nThe slide to three-year lows follows reduced demand for exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to ether.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data quoted by ETC Group in its weekly report, global ether ETPs registered net outflows of around $63.5 million last week, with Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) losing the most. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETPs raked in $92.5 million last week.\n\nSeveral factors, including competing layer 1s and lingering uncertainty about the debut of spot ETH approvals in the U.S, are likely responsible for ETH falling out of investor favor.\n\n“The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has reinforced bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative and its status as a macro asset. On the other hand, open questions about ETH’s fundamental positioning within the crypto sector remain. Competing layer-1s (L1s) like Solana detract from Ethereum’s positioning as the \u0027go-to\u0027 network for decentralized app (dApp) deployment,” Coinbase Institutional’s Research analyst David Han said in a note Wednesday.\n\nSolana’s share in total decentralized exchange volumes has grown tenfold from 2% to 21% in one year, eating into Ethereum\u0027s market share.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighted nearly a dozen spot BTC ETFs in January. Since then, these funds have drawn roughly $12 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors.\n\nApproval of spot ETFs tied to ether will open a similar pool of capital for Ethereum’s native token, although it’s unclear when the SEC will approve it.\n\nTraders on decentralized betting platform Polymarket see just a 10% chance of the SEC approving a spot ETF on or before May 31. The regulator has until May 23 to decide whether to approve or reject VanEck’s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF. The deadline for BlackRock’s application is June 23.\n\nAccording to finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, the SEC is looking for reasons to deny ETH ETF applications by BlackRock and others on grounds that they have been improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they hold a security.\n\nIlan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said ether is a \"lightning rod\" for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots.\n\n“Capital gets fragmented. There are proportionally greater numbers of ways to get exposure to the ecosystem through the many Layer 2s tokens (OP, ARB…) and native protocol tokens in each one. The capital gets fragmented,\" Solot said in an email.\n\nSolot added that strong anti-ETH sentiment from [rival] Solana community and Bitcoin propounders is driving negative ether narratives and the high beta cryptocurrency is a \"perfect vehicle\" for external players to express bearish view given it trades on traditional exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nLastly, Ether recently turned inflationary, reversing the bullish deflationary supply trend seen consistently since its parent network Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus ecosystem in September 2022.\n\n",

    "summary": "By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers, Montclair State University adjunct professor Burak Tamac writes.\n\n",
    "content": "As bitcoin (BTC) continues to gain traction worldwide, the approach to introducing it to newcomers plays a crucial role in its widespread adoption. While some advocates firmly believe in a \"Bitcoin only\" narrative, this aggressive stance can often hinder the conversation and deter potential adopters.\n\nInstead, a \"Bitcoin first\" approach, which prioritizes education and understanding, may prove more effective in fostering genuine interest and long-term investment in bitcoin.\n\nBurak Tamac is an adjunct professor at Montclair State University, teaching politics and technology.\n\nThis essay is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.\n\nProponents of the \"Bitcoin only\" narrative often argue passionately for the superiority of bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies. However, this approach can come across as confrontational and off-putting to those who are new to the concept. When people feel attacked or told that their current investments are wrong, they are more likely to disengage from the conversation entirely. This is particularly true in countries like Turkey, where many individuals are already familiar with alternative investments like altcoins.\n\nTo effectively promote bitcoin adoption, the focus should shift from telling people what to do to providing them with the knowledge to make informed decisions. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in understanding the broader cryptocurrency landscape, educators can help people grasp the unique features and advantages of bitcoin without disparaging other investments outright.\n\nWhen individuals learn about the Bitcoin network\u0027s decentralized nature, its limited supply and its potential as a store of value, they can better appreciate its significance. This foundation of knowledge allows them to evaluate other cryptocurrencies more critically and recognize the authenticity of bitcoin\u0027s value proposition.\n\nSee also: Allen Farrington: Capital in the 21st Century | Opinion\n\nEncouraging people to blindly invest in bitcoin without proper understanding is a short-sighted approach. When individuals buy bitcoin solely based on hype or fear of missing out, they are more likely to panic sell during market fluctuations. This behavior not only harms their personal financial well-being but also discourages them to learn more about bitcoin.\n\nIn contrast, when people invest in bitcoin after learning about its fundamentals and long-term potential, they are more likely to hold their investments through market cycles. This informed decision-making promotes stability and helps to build a stronger, more resilient Bitcoin community.\n\nTo accelerate bitcoin adoption, I believe advocates should prioritize education to start a conversation; and the education should not start about what they do wrong, but what they can do more. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy and technological understanding, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers.\n\nBy adopting a \"Bitcoin first\" approach that prioritizes education and understanding, we can create a more welcoming and empowering environment for newcomers. This shift in narrative, from \"Bitcoin only\" to \"Bitcoin first,\" has the potential to accelerate adoption.\n\n",

I do not believe that they will change or influence my positions on how the core protocol should be developed, but I believe that the community should know about this, so that they can keep me accountable.\"\n\nFeist acknowledged that many skeptics fear \"Eigenlayer will lead to a dystopia of dangerously designed restaking services,\" and that a \"second type of risk comes from the additional load imposed on stakers by running restaking services,\" which \"can lead to centralizing forces.\"\n\n\"I think Eigenlayer will be a major benefit to Ethereum, if it is done by someone with high integrity,\" Feist wrote. \"I trust the current leaders are intending to do that, and I am planning to hold them accountable for it.\"\n\nDrake noted in his disclosure that he pledged \"to reinject all advisorship proceeds towards worthy projects within the Ethereum ecosystem, either as investments or donations,\" and that he also stands ready \"to end the advisorship at any time, e.g. should EigenLayer go in a direction I deem to be against Ethereum\u0027s interests.\"\n\nHe also said that, given his \"focus on restaking risks,\" one can expect his \"default public stance to continue to lean critical of EigenLayer.\"\n\n\"I will try to make my criticism constructive, advocating for mitigations to risks like the erosion of solo validators and the intersubjective overloading of Ethereum consensus,” Drake wrote.\n\nAnother user on X, @themandalore9, wrote: “I applaud the transparency, but he was probably the biggest / most well known voice in the fight against LST\u0027s and restaking. I know he say\u0027s he\u0027ll stay critical, but money corrupts the subconscious in ways that you\u0027d never believe.”\n\nRead more: EigenLayer Opens Claims for Airdrop of EIGEN Token, Though It\u0027s Non-Transferable\n\n",

If cryptocurrencies get support from the global risk appetite on Friday, Bitcoin could exceed $70K over the weekend,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in a note to CoinDesk, referring to increased inflows from spot ETFs.\n\n“A test of the $71K-$74K highs area, in our view, could happen as early as early next week, triggering a new episode of FOMO,” Kuptsikevich.\n\nSingapore-based QCP Capital gave out similar price targets in a client note earlier this week.\n\nSuch bullish outlooks come as U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the asset have logged four straight days of inflows, ending Thursday at $257 million in net inflows. This is a nearly 180-degree turn from the action of the past few weeks – with some of the biggest ETFs seeing zero inflows on some days.\n\nBlackRock’s IBIT received $94 million in inflows on Thursday, the largest among peers.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is set to weigh in on VanEck\u0027s ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) on May 23 and the Ark/21 Shares one on May 24, as well as Nvidia earnings.\n\nMarch Zheng, managing partner of Bizantine Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview that while the market has priced near the certainty of a rejection, there are still some reasons to be optimistic.\n\n\"There are reasons to believe that the report will contain silver linings for the delay, which should signal an eventual approval of Ethereum in the next year,\" Zheng said. \"The removal of staking prepositions by filers reclassifies underlying ETH as commodities supported by the CFTC and can pave a major pathway going forward.\"\n\nPolymarket currently gives a 10% chance of an ether ETF being approved by May 31, a 13% chance of approval by June 30, and a 28% chance of approval this year.\n\nRecently, Coinbase analyst David Han wrote that the market may be \"underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval.\"\n\nZheng argued that positive ETH ETF news might also boost trading sentiments for BASE, a Layer-2 network, whose native token\u0027s price has dropped by nearly 25% in the last two weeks.\n\nTraders are also going to be eyeing Nvidia\u0027s earnings, scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin trades strongly in correlation with Nvidia, as do Artificial intelligence-themed tokens, which surged in February as the chip designer reported better-than-expected earnings.\n\nThe direct correlation between Nvidia and ether market movement isn\u0027t as strong as it once was during the mining boom. Still, the rising tide of bitcoin and AI tokens – should Nvidia\u0027s earnings remain strong – will likely lift all boats.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The leading exchange continues to innovate in response to user needs. Its lending protocol offers a one-stop solution for all borrowing and lending requirements, while the upcoming upgrade to the SocialFi tool Pulse is designed to reward high-quality engagement.\n\nIncrease capital and leverage through asset-backed loans,\n\nEnjoy competitive rates and\n\nExperience seamless fund mobility.\n\n",
    "content": "Phemex, a top-tier cryptocurrency exchange, continues its streak of CeFi and DeFi innovations. Transitioning from a purely centralized platform, Phemex embraced decentralization last year and has evolved into a hybrid exchange, merging the best features of CEXes and DEXes. The latest fruit of this evolution is the Phemex Lending Protocol, which allows users to borrow cryptocurrency against their digital assets with favorable rates and ultimate flexibility, signaling Phemex\u0027s commitment to innovative, user-empowering solutions.\n\nWhile crypto enthusiasts have long expected that feature from their exchanges, Phemex revealed earlier this week some new advantages that can’t be found anywhere else.\n\nIf you think about it, there are three main reasons why you might want to use any crypto exchange’s lending services:\n\nBy each of these measures, the Phemex Lending Protocol meets or exceeds industry standards. Participants can take out loans denominated in USDT, BTC or ETH without the need to sell their crypto assets. Loans can also be taken out in PT, Phemex’s high-potential native coin.\n\nBecause all loans are securely collateralized by participants’ assets, Phemex can provide flexibility to choose loan terms with variable interest rates. Whatever the time horizon on the loan, crypto exchanges can generally offer better rates than brick-and-mortar banks, according to Forbes Advisor.\n\nEven so, the Phemex team is confident that their loans compare favorably even among crypto exchanges. Phemex highlights its competitive edge with an annual USDT borrowing interest rate starting at 3.57%, a figure notably lower than the double-digit rates prevalent on competing platforms – not to mention almost two percentage points lower than money-center banks lend to each other overnight. For holders of vePT – the wrapped PT version that will soon confer voting authority in Phemex’s governing DAO – the deal gets even sweeter with an additional 30% discount on borrowing rates.\n\nOf course, Phemex community members can withdraw and reallocate funds as they see fit, unfettered by undue limitations or delays. This means that Phemex traders can enjoy more lucrative capital efficiency than they can on other exchanges, aligning with the cryptosphere’s goal of unlocking the potential of money.\n\nAt Token2049 in Dubai last week, Phemex made a significant splash by hosting an elite gathering of major crypto community players and key opinion leaders. The extensive two-day networking event featured an insightful keynote by Phemex CEO Federico Variola. Another highlight of Token2049 was the introduction of the Phemex Lending Protocol, when Phemex COO Stella Chan showcased its competitive borrowing rates and the opportunity for users to supply assets in return for substantial earnings. In the future, the platform is expected to add uncollateralized loan capabilities which would propel its services beyond that of most DeFi lending protocols.\n\n“Phemex Lending Protocol is changing the game with low borrowing rates and a clear loan-to-value ratio, without any hidden fees,\" Chan announced. \"With $22 million in liquidity to start, users can now secure loans leveraging their holdings at just 3.57% APY – far below the high rates of other platforms. Our protocol ensures that users keep control, allowing them to freely withdraw and manage their funds. Additionally, by contributing to our lending pools, they can earn competitive APY returns, creating a robust passive income stream. It\u0027s a complete solution for favorable borrowing and earning.”\n\nBy integrating these lending features, Phemex is not only expanding its services but also reinforcing its commitment to fostering a more inclusive and accessible financial environment for all its users.\n\nCertainly, Phemex has a grander vision than just providing lower interest rates on collateralized loans. The team there has been all about innovation. All this leads into its Web3 ecosystem, Phemexia, aiming to provide users with greater autonomy and cultivate a robust community where trust and permissionless collaboration are paramount.\n\n“Phemex is at the forefront as the crypto world evolves far beyond just digital cash, spearheading the charge into a digital ecosystem integral to our online lives,\" Chan says. \"Our users want democratized financial tools with uncompromising security, and we\u0027re delivering just that. We\u0027re pioneering in the Web3 space, answering the call with innovations like our new hybrid stack. It combines on-chain autonomy with reliable centralized performance, showcased by our latest offering – the Phemex Lending Protocol.\n\nSoon, users will be able to enhance our exchange\u0027s liquidity and earn rewards using our AMM protocol. We\u0027re eager to drive more innovation and sustain our collaborations with visionary partners in upcoming integrations and listings.”\n\nWhile Phemex’s PT token may be the most successful exchange-native coin this year, Phemex also generated a lot of buzz with the launch of its new SocialFi product Pulse. The platform elevates community groups within the social media realm by offering a decentralized hub, similar to a mix of Telegram\u0027s groups and Twitter\u0027s connectivity, but within the realm of Web3. Pulse sets itself apart with a unique reward system where community interaction directly earns users PT, a feature unmatched by any other social network.\n\nPhemex is now gearing up for the launch of Pulse Season 3, responding to community feedback by enhancing the platform with features that incentivize superior content. With the introduction of “Cast” for sharing insightful content and “Tip” as a way to appreciate high-quality engagement, users can now earn tips for their casts, increasing their chances of winning a portion of the daily 10,000 PT prize pool and ensuring that outstanding content is rewarded.\n\nUltimately, the team’s goal is to expand Web3 use cases into the broader world. The more people get comfortable with blockchain technology and functions, the more widely digital assets will gain acceptance – and the faster these assets will appreciate in value.\n\n“Our mission is rooted in providing a user-centric ecosystem that offers the best trading experiences alongside a vibrant community. As we roll out our hybrid stack with the Phemex Lending launch, we\u0027re simultaneously fine-tuning Pulse based on user insights,” Chan says. “Community-driven development is pivotal to Pulse\u0027s growth, and with Season 3 on the horizon, we aim to reward the creation and engagement of premium content. We are dedicated to nurturing a community where meaningful interaction is recognized and rewarded.”\n\n",

ShibaSwap held over $25 million in locked tokens as of Thursday, data shows, with $1.7 million in trading volumes in the past 24 hours.\n\n“The more transactions will run on Shibarium blockchain, the more the protocol will burn base gas fees which will impact the overall burn rate of $SHIB,” they said.\n\nBurns refer to the permanent removal of tokens from circulating supply by sending them to an address that no one controls.\n\nEvery swap and stake on ShibaSwap contributes to the ecosystem\u0027s growth as increased trading volumes bring higher fees for stakers and LP providers, developers said in an X post.\n\n",

    "summary": "The renowned a16z VC talks to Daniel Kuhn about his new book, “Read Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet.”\n\n",
    "content": "There is a growing divide between techno-optimists and pessimists. Growing up I vaguely remember a public debate between bible thumpers and people who wanted evolution taught in school. The same sort of argument is playing out in a number of different ways today — a media “Techlash” vs. Silicon Valley, humanists vs. nerds, progressivism vs. material progress — but recently, in his \"Techno-Optimist Manifesto,\" venture capitalist Marc Andreessen boiled it down to a war between deccelerationists and accelerationists. That is, those who want the rate of technology to slow, stagnate or reverse and those who want the opposite.\n\nChris Dixon is a speaker at CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus conference, beginning May 29, in Austin, Texas.\n\nIn Andreessen’s eyes, the debate has metastasized to touch nearly every corner of human endeavor. And in many ways it has: with the increasing rate of internet adoption, tech plays an ever-larger role in our daily lives. More and more of our interactions are mediated by social media and mobile apps. As cash falls by the wayside, almost all economic activity is routed through digital rails operated by banks or fintechs. We’re streaming more, playing more online games and even taking work online.\n\nWhile many of these developments have made modern life more convenient and efficient, tech also causes problems. Even if you buy into the idea that all technologies are neutral, just “tools” to be put to better or worse use, it’s hard not to think that there’s something dystopian about the past two decades of technological progress. As many crypto advocates point out, as the internet grows, our lives are put in the hands of a few monopolistic companies.\n\nThis is the point of departure for Chris Dixon’s new book, “Read Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet,” published on Jan. 30. Dixon, a long-time colleague of Andreessen, who runs the independent crypto arm at storied VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), traces the lineage of the web to find what has gone awry. What started out as a network of interoperable and open protocols, what’s now known as Web1, has been sectioned off in Web2. It’s an era where essentially five companies control who gets to use what, when and why. Thankfully, Dixon argues, what comes next, Web3, offers real solutions.\n\nWeb3 is a bit of a buzzword, Dixon admits. For him, it can be defined as the “ownership” layer that has been so far missing from the web. While Facebook and Twitter did connect the world in some sense, it never allowed users to own their identities or accounts. It’s a similar story across digital banking, blogging or really anything online with a sign-in and password. With the rise of blockchains, what Dixon refers to as virtual computers, users are finally in control over their digital lives — so long as they maintain control over their private keys.\n\nIt might take a techno-optimist to think that blockchain can reverse the consolidation of the web, considering the trillions of dollars at play, how little adoption has taken place so far and the industry’s battered reputation in the mainstream. But for Dixon, apart from crypto’s ability to hand back control to everyday users, blockchains also offer a space for permissionless development. We may not know exactly what blockchains are useful for today, but so long as there are people as excited about the tech as Dixon is, we’re likely to find out eventually.\n\nSee also: It\u0027s Time to BUIDL\n\nCoinDesk spoke with Dixon, who will be at Consensus 2024, to get a better sense of the three eras of the web, his work as a venture capitalist funding the next wave of crypto startups and whether he thinks direct democracy is over- or underrated, among other pressing issues. The interview has been lightly edited and condensed.\n\nThe overall theme of the book is the evolution of the internet from Web1, composed of open source protocols, to Web2, which was walled off and siloed, to the re-decentralizing force of Web3 and crypto. Would you consider blockchain to be part of the wider open-source movement and in what ways are Web1 and Web3 different?\n\nIn the book I talked about outside versus inside-out technologies, which is this idea that, if you look at the history of computing, there\u0027s things like the iPhone and AI that came from established institutions like Apple and Google and Stanford, and then there\u0027s a whole separate tradition of hackers at the fringe, building stuff. Early PCs — the Homebrew Computer Club was Steve Jobs. They were outsiders. Open-source software, Linux and the whole stack of open source software came from outside. There\u0027s no central casting for computing platforms. Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, was a physicist at CERN. Blockchain is very much in that mold, inheriting that tradition of deep believers of openness and shared systems that’s motivated through a distinct ethos.\n\nA lot of people call Facebook a “platform” because you can technically build apps on it. Is there a better definition for what makes a platform, in the sense that blockchains won’t kick you off like Facebook did to Zynga?\n\nFacebook may be a platform, but it\u0027s very shaky. There\u0027s a long history of entrepreneurs who tried to build on top of Facebook and Twitter, and felt essentially robbed because they changed the terms-of-condition and APIs. I think we see this going on with Apple right now with Epic suing them and companies like Netflix and Spotify not creating apps for the Meta Quest Pro or Apple Vision headsets. A platform is supposed to be a predictable, safe place that developers can build a real business on and have some degree of certainty. If you think about the offline world, like starting a restaurant, when you spend all this time and money, you can still run your restaurant even if the landlord jacks up the rent. That\u0027s what we have today: essentially five big landlords that appreciably change the rules and change rents. That\u0027s created a very inhospitable environment for independent developers and startups.\n\nIn the venture capital business, we invest in startups. We want to see a dynamic internet that\u0027s hospitable to startups. One of the reasons I\u0027m excited about blockchains, is because I see them as a way to return us to predictable platforms, where entrepreneurs and creators can build direct relationships with their audiences. This is what the internet was supposed to be. I really worry that the way we\u0027re headed now, there\u0027s going to be three or four big platforms like broadcast TV in the 70s — ABC, NBC, CBS. And everyone\u0027s going to spend their time in one of those silos. To me, that\u0027s a tragic outcome for what was once this open, democratic network. We should be doing all we can to counter that.\n\nAre you willing to say anything about Oculus? You’ve hinted in interviews in the past that you\u0027ve been sort of unsatisfied with how it\u0027s been managed by Meta.\n\nI made that investment for us back in November 2013. I\u0027m glad Facebook is invested in VR and about Apple investing in VR. They’ve done a good job generally, and spent an incredible amount of money. I am concerned that, similar to the themes I\u0027m talking about with the internet, we\u0027re going to end up with two new giant corporate platforms without an open-source alternative. There\u0027s no Linux of VR right now. They\u0027re both seemingly running the same strategy of a tightly controlled App Store with 30% payments, like the iOS ecosystem.\n\nI\u0027m very bullish on VR. I think it\u0027s going to be a big deal. I just worry we\u0027re going to keep repeating the same cycle. Everyone initially dismisses technology as a toy, then they suddenly wake up to the fact that two companies control a very important resource — like social media. We should put up the alarm bells earlier this time.\n\nOne of the major differences between Web1 and Web3 is the role of the government and academia developing the foundational internet protocols. Does Web3 need another DARPA like to succeed?\n\nI don\u0027t think so. There\u0027s enough sources of funding, that\u0027s not the shortcoming. We need more entrepreneurs, we need more academics, we need clear policy. Because many policy decisions are playing out in courts, and that takes many years; it creates uncertainty and disincentivizes entrepreneurs.\n\nWe want to be as inclusive as possible. If folks in academia and government want to get involved in a constructive way, that\u0027s awesome. Our research team, led by Tim Roughgarden, who is a professor at Columbia, and Dan Boneh, a professor at Stanford, write academic papers and do seminars — everything\u0027s open-source. We try to get more people involved. Unfortunately, there\u0027s just a ton of misunderstanding around the blockchain space, which is a big reason I wrote the book. There\u0027s a lot more skepticism than is warranted.\n\nYou write that software is more like fiction than anything, and have said that information wants to be free. Does this imply that fiction or other creative works should be priced at the level for commodity inputs or devalued broadly?\n\nI don’t think I said information wants to be free.\n\nIn previous interviews you\u0027ve suggested it.\n\nOkay, let me maybe add nuance. I don\u0027t know exactly what context I said it; I very strongly believe that creative people should be paid for their work. There’s a section in the book on the media business where I call attention to the attention monetization trade off, which is a trade-off in media between getting people to see what you do by sharing it on the internet and charging for it.\n\nThe video game industry is the most pioneering in that it has figured out it’s a better business to, instead of charging for the game, charge for compliments to the game like virtual goods. League of Legends and Fortnight, two of the most successful games, are free. I suspect, as AI enables anybody to create high-quality illustrations for free, that\u0027s gonna put downward pressure on the prices of illustrations. So it\u0027s more important than ever to think about new business models for creative people that don\u0027t involve simply, quote-unquote, selling the game. They sell other things.\n\nInformation can be free in the sense that content can be free, and creative people can still get paid. NFTs are an obvious example, right? How do artists get paid in the offline world? Artists don\u0027t get paid by copyrighting the image of a painting; they want that image to propagate and they sell the original paintings or photographs. They sell essentially the signed, authenticated version of the image, not the image itself. NFTs introduced a similar idea into the digital world. You can reconcile an internet where sharing content that drives the price of the content to zero with business models that make sure creative people get paid.\n\nNFTs help monetize work and build alternative revenue streams, but they don\u0027t necessarily fix the problems of distribution or building audiences. This is an idea that came up in your conversation with Bob Iger, who argued, if you have a brand identity, it doesn’t matter which technological medium you’re using to distribute work. Do you see potential solutions to this problem?\n\nI write about collaborative storytelling — where communities of people come together and create narrative worlds. Think of Star Wars, Harry Potter, but future versions of that. Creators work collaboratively, Wikipedia-style, to come up with storylines. You already see this happening on Reddit, where people critique Star Wars and suggest storylines. I read some of that stuff; people have really good ideas. Imagine those people got rewarded with NFTs and tokens that give them financial upside if the narrative world is successful? That also solves a distribution problem, right?\n\nHollywood only does sequels of existing IP because it costs hundreds of millions of dollars to market new IP. If you have a million fans who own tokens, who helped to create a narrative universe, they now have an incentive to evangelize that universe. You could fork Star Wars, create your own version of it. It\u0027s an internet-native way to create genuine fans with skin in the game. Think about how people get excited about bitcoin or meme coins or something and apply it to narrative storytelling to propagate and generate movies, video games and comics.\n\nA few higher profile hires left a16z. Why do you stay instead of going solo?\n\nWell, look, I\u0027ve been here for over a decade. Among other things, I\u0027m close to my partners Marc [Andreessen] and Ben [Horowitz]. What we\u0027re trying to do at the firm is kind of the best of both worlds: a bigger firm with a platform that helps us save on administrative overhead and use our business as a network to build relationships with Fortune 500 companies, limited partners and policymakers — all the different kinds of relevant constituents. At the same time, with our crypto fund, we were able to go really deep and vertical and bring experts onto our team.\n\nAre there any fundamental disagreements you have with Marc?\n\nWe argue in a very friendly way, and try to encourage a culture of healthy debate at the firm. The thing that we share that\u0027s the kind of uniting principle across the firm is we\u0027re “tech optimists.” I have been my whole life, frankly. It\u0027s important to recognize that all technology has pros and cons. You can use a hammer to build or destroy a house. We also believe smart regulation balances innovation and consumer safety. But we strongly believe technology is a force for good — and that\u0027s what we see as our mission. Furthermore, we believe that startups are an important part of technology, that new company formation has been an important part of the U.S. economic engine and we want to play a part in that. There aren\u0027t that many scaled institutions that are strongly pro tech and pro startup.\n\nSee also: Coinbase vs. the SEC Argues About Beanie Babies\n\nI agree in general that technology is neutral, but also that specific things are designed for harm. Do you at all disagree with the firm\u0027s investments in military technology?\n\nSilicon Valley has a long history of being both supported by and supporting the U.S. government. Our view generally is that we\u0027re pro-U.S. and its allies. We want to do what we can to support the U.S. government more and it\u0027s not our place to decide on foreign policy. We don\u0027t have our own State Department.\n\nYou describe blockchains as “near-Turing complete” computers whereas others often just call them Turing complete. Why split hairs?\n\nI have much smarter people on my team, computer scientists who get mad at me when I say Turing-complete. I think there\u0027s certain functions you can\u0027t do — recursion, random numbers, things you need oracles for. So I\u0027m just trying to be academically precise. You still have a very rich design space as a developer.\n\nYou said that the overreliance on advertising was the “original sin of the internet.” Advertising has paid for many wonderful things: a once-thriving newspaper industry; great TV, movies, stuff like that. Why is advertising uniquely poisonous on the web?\n\nI\u0027m not against all advertising, but the pendulum swung way too far towards advertising and it\u0027s resulted in an adversarial relationship between companies and users. You\u0027re getting tracked constantly. You click on a lawn mower and then forever, you see more and more ads for lawn mowers. Google defaults all my preferences without asking me, storing all my searches forever. And the argument that ads pay for free services: there are other ways beyond freemium. Most SAAS software works this way — Slack, Discord, Spotify, a lot of software.\n\nGames also have free tiers, and upsell you stuff. That\u0027s a way for them to essentially give away the software for free to [the] 95% of the users [who] won\u0027t pay for it. I probably play Clash Royale too much; it\u0027s a free game. But some percentage of the users, including me, end up buying upgrades that pays for everybody else. So I think there are other ways.\n\nFree software is a very important thing. And we want software in the hands of billions of people. But I don\u0027t think advertising is the only way to go. The two biggest pure internet services, Meta and Google, are fully ad-based.\n\nBut is there something unique about the architecture of the web that made advertising a problem?\n\nIt was just a historical thing. I mentioned in the book, but it took a long lot longer for payments to develop. First you needed encryption. People forget this but there was a very controversial technology introduced by Netscape, SSL [Secure Sockets Layer] encryption, that caused arguments over encrypted internet communications. E-commerce didn\u0027t exist, online banking didn\u0027t exist, and so it seemed as if the only potential users of it would be terrorists and criminals. That was a common argument. Netscape was classified as munitions and was illegal to export; they had to have a special version for international users.\n\nThere was also a big political debate in the 90s over the Clipper Chip, the Clinton administration chip that would have forced weak encryption on everybody. So, because it took a long time for encryption to develop, it took a long time for payments to develop, and advertising filled that void. And then it just sort of became the norm throughout the 2000s as social networking and search grew.\n\nOver the last decade, the pendulum has been swinging back very strongly. The vast majority of unicorns in the last 10 years have been paid services, enterprise software, prosumer software. But we\u0027re still overly reliant on advertising.\n\nThere’s a lot I wanted to touch on, would you maybe want to do a round of overrated/underrated?\n\nI\u0027m always gonna want to probably add nuance.\n\nFeel free definitely if something strikes. Web2 communities.\n\nYou mean like Reddit and Discord and all that?\n\nYeah, overrated/underrated?\n\nI think it\u0027s like I think the fact that we\u0027ve built a system where five billion people can all communicate and congregate around shared interests is a great thing. It\u0027s an amazing accomplishment, I\u0027m very pro.\n\nDirect democracy? You mean in DAOs or in the real world?\n\nEither, was thinking DAOs.\n\nI have a chapter in the book about network governance. It\u0027s an important direction to develop. Having community owned networks and digital services is a vast improvement over having corporate-owned networks and digital services. People are exploring new ways to do this governance, including through DAOs – from Uniswap and Compound. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s figured out yet, by the way. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s figured out in the real world either. If you talk to governance experts, it\u0027s a constant struggle to get large groups of people together to govern things in an orderly way, and I think we\u0027re seeing similar things in the online world.\n\nPoint systems for airdrops. Overrated/underrated?\n\nI think that\u0027s an ambiguous word. As I understand points, it\u0027s sort of non-transferable tokens people use in different ways. There\u0027s just a lot of people experimenting. There\u0027s also regulatory reasons why points might be advantageous. They clearly behave much more like Starbucks points, or more traditional rewards.\n\nCBDCs?\n\nI\u0027m not positive on those. What\u0027s happening with USDC, as an example; stablecoins show how popular digital dollars are, right? I mean, many trillions of dollars worth of transactions happen via stablecoins. There\u0027s been so much good work on the infrastructure layer, with L2s [layer 2s] and other blockchains, that I think the private sector will find high-quality technological solutions. Obviously, we need the use of dollars to be regulated. But that\u0027s different than having the government go and try to actually build the software.\n\nVC funding in crypto. Overrated, underrated?\n\nI mean — I know we get a lot of s**t on Twitter, but my view is, especially during the crypto winter… Let me tell you this, we started the first crypto fund beginning late 2017-18, and there just wasn\u0027t a lot of funding happening in crypto. We did the seed and Series A of Compound, did the Series A for Uniswap. We funded a bunch of NFT projects going back to I think 2017. I co-led the Series A of Dapper and CryptoKitties. So I just think that VC funding can play an important role in funding things. That might not be popular. The nature of VC funding is we have a very long term time horizon — 10 year funds — so we\u0027re able to fund things when other people aren\u0027t. That kind of persistence and commitment is sometimes overlooked, especially during boom times when funding is flowing. Of course, VC can mean a lot of things and there\u0027s a lot of different firms — some people call themselves VCs when they\u0027re really more like hedge funds or traders. But we roll up our sleeves, and I think play a valuable role in the startup ecosystem.\n\nSee also: If You\u0027re in Crypto, You\u0027re a Criminal\n\nYour fund at a16z operates autonomously. Say on a 10 year horizon, if crypto grows, do you see the Crypto Fund diversifying further to have specific multi billion dollar funds focused just on DeFi or blockchain social media?\n\nMy hope is for blockchain to become synonymous with new internet innovation. In that case, I don\u0027t know exactly how we would structure it, but if you analogize it to the internet in the 90s, there were internet funds and internet investors and then, over time, there were more focused consumer internet, fintech and enterprise investors. Ideally, that would happen here.\n\nThere\u0027s a million other questions I could ask, wish we had more time.\n\nHow do you like the book?\n\nI loved it, really. Maybe the best general introduction to crypto I’ve come across. Anything you wish I asked?\n\nMy hope is that crypto folks will like the book as much as you do. But really, I wanted a book that explains this all to the general public. There’s a big gap between why I\u0027m excited and the general public, which has a more negative view. So, I really hope it becomes the book that people like to give to their friends and family and say, “Hey, this is why I\u0027m excited.”\n\nWas it significantly different writing the book versus Twitter threads?\n\nI don\u0027t know if I fully understood what I was getting myself into. It was a ton of work. But it was gratifying and fun.\n\n",

    "title": "BlockFi’s Rise and Fall: A Timeline",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "BlockFi, a crypto lending company, was founded in October 2017 and filed for bankruptcy just over five years later in the wake of FTX\u0027s collapse.\n\n",
    "content": "Crypto lender BlockFi is kaput. The platform, which offered high yields on crypto deposits, has filed for bankruptcy protection. It’s the latest company to fall after the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Indeed, bankruptcy filings show that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. But how did it all go so wrong? CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture.\n\nZac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company’s chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral.\n\nVenture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer.\n\nFlush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it \"doesn’t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.” As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn’t seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company.\n\nThe firm’s next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts.\n\nIn December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood’s business model. “Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,” BlockFi’s CEO said.\n\nPeter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led BlockFi’s $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping “BlockFi expand into Singapore” and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nBlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to “crypto payment rails” such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren\u0027t already cryptocurrency owners.” The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform.\n\nAll was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee’s phone with a “SIM swap” that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee’s phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi’s retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi’s customers.\n\nIn August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors.\n\nIn October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk\u0027s parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020.\n\nBlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin.\n\nEarly in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale’s product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nAll was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin’s soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong?\n\nNew Jersey’s Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state’s financial regulator claimed BlockFi’s interest accounts amounted to sales of an “unregistered security” and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers.\n\nThe CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that – and it didn’t end well for BlockFi (we’ll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card.\n\nIn February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. “Today’s settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.\n\nIn June, BlockFi’s valuation sank to $1 billion in a “down round” – a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund\u0027s collateral before its bankruptcy. In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi’s main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nIn dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren’t met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S.\n\nAt the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11.\n\nThat was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX’s credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid “the lack of clarity” about FTX. On Nov. 11, California’s financial regulator revoked BlockFi’s lending license.\n\nBlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried\u0027s Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan.\n\nIn the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX. All the while, one question looms: Will customers get anything back?\n\nRead More: Latest BlockFi Stories\n\n",

    "content": "A single picture on Monday sparked rallies across some cat-themed meme coins and Gamestop stock (NYSE: GME) as market cults heralded the apparent return of TheRoaringKitty, the X profile of retail trader Keith Gill, who made his first post since late 2021.\n\nGill posted a meme that refers to a period of “locking in,” a colloquial term for a period of intense focus or concentration. Users on X and Reddit largely seemed to consider the image as a sign to lock into trading markets.\n\nStocks related to Gill and other “meme stocks,” surged. GME prices were up as high as 44% in pre-market trading, and surged as high as 100% on market open before trading was halted. Cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE: AMC) was up 12% in pre-market, rising to as much as 30% after open.\n\nAn unaffiliated GameStop meme coin on the Solana blockchain surged more than 550%, DEXTools data shows, while an AMC token jumped 1,200%. Some microcap cat-themed meme coins such as kitty (KITTY) rose thousands of percent, while larger tokens popcat (POPCAT) and mog (MOG) rose over 15%. Larger-cap meme coins (DOGE) and (SHIB) were higher by 5% and 7%, respectively.\n\nData shows that opportunistic developers issued a slew of tokens referring to Gill, TheRoaringKitty, GameStop, and “stonks” – a meme term for stocks—in the past 24 hours.\n\nGill’s analysis of the video game retailer GameStop on Reddit, starting in 2019 and gaining traction during the COVID pandemic, created a viral phenomenon at the time. It was largely cited as a driving factor in the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021 as several small-time traders banded together and purchased options and leveraged shares of the company.\n\nThe stock rose from $4 to over $120 in a month and, at its peak, was up thousands of percent from its lifetime low of 64 cents in April 2020.\n\nGill’s initial $53,000 investment was worth nearly $50 million at its peak, emerging as a rags-to-riches story of a lone trader making a fortune from his bedroom by betting against hedge funds. One of the most prolific losers was Melvin Capital, a fund that lost billions of dollars betting on the decline of meme stocks, among other bets that move against it.\n\n",

There was no apparent catalyst for the jumps.\n\nTokens of layer-1 blockchains, such as ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL and Avalanche’s AVAX, were among the worst-performing categories, with an average rise of 5.5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index of major tokens, minus stablecoins, rose nearly 6%.\n\nOn-chain analysis tool Lookonchain said in an X post that whales, a colloquial term for wealthy traders whose actions can move token prices, picked up millions of dollars worth of meme tokens cat in a dogs world (MEW) and slerf (SLERF).

That caused a market-wide decline as majors dropped as much as 18%.\n\nAs a result, $2 billion in futures positions were liquidated over the weekend, the most since March. Over $1.5 billion of those positions were betting on higher prices, data from analysis tool Coinalyze shows.\n\nA Coinalyze representative told CoinDesk in an X message that the leverage flush caused open interest – or the number of unsettled futures contracts – to drop $13 billion since Friday, indicative of bets being closed.\n\nSome traders said the price fall was expected ahead of the halving, a much-anticipated event on April 20 that will cut the rewards offered to network miners by half.\n\n“While previous halving events have historically been followed by 9-12 months of uptrend, they have often triggered short-term \u0027sell the news\u0027 reactions before and after the event,” Matteo Greco, a research analyst at digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, told CoinDesk in an email.\n\n“This short-term bearish sentiment is also reflected in the net outflow of $85 million from Bitcoin Spot ETFs during the week, signaling increased profit-taking and investor caution following the strong uptrend in both Q4 2023 and Q1 2024,” Greco added, referring to bitcoin ETF products in the U.S.\n\n",

    "title": "Why William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s Price",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Recently released emails from former SEC director William Hinman have rallied the XRP troops, but the documents are not a smoking gun.\n\n",
    "content": "On June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC\u0027s lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nVery broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly.\n\nRipple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators.\n\nEarly analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails’ release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front.\n\nAhead of the documents’ release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn’t a security if it is “sufficiently decentralized.” That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is “sufficiently decentralized” and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman.\n\nCritics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token – and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security.\n\nRipple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called “Ripple” even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders “gifted” 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as “Ripple.”\n\nRead More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency?\n\nTo critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of “decentralization theater.” And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures.\n\nIn any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple\u0027s side of the case, XRP\u0027s price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.\n\nSee Also: Ripple Does Not Care Whether XRP Is “Sufficiently Decentralized”\n\n",

A new version is bringing the hype back.\n\nFriend.Tech, a blockchain-based social application that allows crypto personalities on X to issue shares for access to closed group chats, has seen a resurgence in activity and value locked.\n\nRecent developments, including a possible FRIEND token and expansion beyond X, have renewed interest in the platform.\n\nMore than $7 million has flowed into the platform in anticipation of the developments.\n\n",
    "content": "Money is flowing back into social application Friend.Tech as a new version teases an eventual airdrop, bringing users back to what was among the biggest revenue-generating platforms during the bear market.\n\nOver $7 million flowed to Friend.Tech last week after months of outflows, boosting the value locked to nearly $40 million, data shows. Weekly fees have crossed $1.3 million for the first time since November, making the platform over $600,000 in revenue.\n\nBuilt on Base, a layer-2 network, Friend.Tech lets crypto personalities on X issue “shares” for access to a closed group chat. For users, the allure of these chats is that their owners could offer trading insights, token picks or access to seed-funding deals – which raises the value of the shares.\n\nThe bump in activity precedes the coming of version 2 of the application, which developers said will be released after April 20. A key element of the update is expanding the platform beyond X to attract newer users.\n\nOver the weekend, developers also teased a FRIEND token. Expectations among users are that these could be distributed based on how many points – a reward for Friend.Tech usage – they accumulate before the token release.\n\nFriend.tech was earning in excess of $1 million per day in fees at its August peak after going viral on X and gaining more than 100,000 unique users, a significant number for crypto application standards. Shares of some crypto X personalities, such as @Cobie and @HsakaTrades, jumped to as much as three ether, or nearly $5,000, at the time.\n\nActivity fell off in the months following as the initial allure wore off. Security risks later marred the platform alongside opportunities elsewhere in the sector, leading to months of outflows since November.\n\n",

    "content": "The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act would hurt investors and hamper the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u0027s work, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said Wednesday.\n\n\"The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (\u0027FIT 21\u0027) would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk,\" he said.\n\nFIT21 is a joint bill produced by the House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, and is intended to clarify how the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversee crypto. It creates a \"digital commodity\" term for digital assets that do not meet the bill\u0027s definition of a security, placing those assets under the CFTC\u0027s purview.\n\nAccording to Gensler, FIT21 ignores long-standing precedent for how investment contracts are regulated, puts the agency into a tough position for certifying self-proclaimed digital commodity issuers, ignores Supreme Court precedent in the Howey Test, removes investor protections and potentially allows investors to take on excessive risk without appropriate disclosures.\n\nU.S. securities laws were developed after the Great Depression to protect consumers by forcing disclosures and giving both the regulator and investors tools to safeguard customers, Gensler said. Crypto industry participants have not been willing to comply with these regulations, he said.\n\n\"The bill would remove investment contracts that are recorded on a blockchain from\n\nthe statutory definition of securities and the time-tested protections of much of the federal\n\nsecurities laws,\" he said. \"By removing this set of investment contracts from the statutory list of securities, the bill implies what courts have repeatedly ruled – but what crypto market participants have attempted to deny – that many crypto assets are being offered and sold as securities under existing law.\"\n\nWhile the bill includes a provision for companies to self-certify that they\u0027re issuing \"digital commodities,\" it gives the SEC 60 days to assess whether those assets meet the bill\u0027s definition of a digital commodity. That is not enough time given just how many digital assets are circulating, he said.\n\nGensler also took aim at how the bill defined a digital commodity, saying it ignored the Howey Test precedent and the economic realities of assets. Between that, the investor protection framework the bill sets in place for crypto investors and the exclusion of exchanges, the bill may \"increase risk to the American public,\" he said.\n\nFIT21 might also harm the U.S.\u0027s broader capital markets, Gensler said, by letting companies try to avoid SEC oversight by using some sort of decentralized network.\n\nThe House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill later on Wednesday, though it does not currently have a clear road through the Senate and is unlikely to become a law this year.\n\n",

    "summary": "The pseudonymous investor – early to both Ethereum and Litecoin – has lived large. He is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.\n\n",
    "content": "It’s quite likely that Otoh has lost more bitcoin than most people will ever hold. An early bitcoin investor, Otoh, a pseudonym that stands for “on the other hand,” has many lessons to share about finding opportunities and making one’s own luck.\n\nOtoh is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.\n\nScheduled to speak on stage at Consensus 2024, in Austin, Texas, alongside crypto luminaries like Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and BTCC and Ballet founder Bobby Lee, Otoh is known among the early crypto crowd for his massive holdings of physical bitcoins – a.k.a. Casascius coins.\n\n“I\u0027ve never sold any. I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage,” Otoh told CoinDesk in an interview, discussing his recent auction of over 200 worth of physical bitcoins in what was the Heritage auction firm’s first crypto sale.\n\nCasascius coins, created by Mike Caldwell (who went by Casascius, an acronym for “call a spade a spade,” on Bitcoin forums), were a solution to spending bitcoin in face-to-face transactions by embedding a Bitcoin private key in a metal coin.\n\nThe last ones were made in 2013 after the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network told Caldwell that he was operating an unlicensed money transmitter business. There are only about 90,000 Casascius coins in circulation, of varying denominations, though other manufacturers including Bobby Lee created their own versions.\n\nA part of Bitcoin lore and its physical history, Casascius coins are now sought after by collectors (some are so valuable that they have to be declared to U.S. Customs when entering the country). In some sense, these coins are the most long lived and recognizable image of the purely a digital currency.\n\n“It seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go,” Otoh said. “Let other people look after them and enjoy having them.”\n\nOf course, part of the danger of bringing bitcoin into the physical realm is that it makes the assets as easy to steal as a $20 note from mom’s purse – and unfortunately, Otoh thinks he was the victim of a theft about a decade ago. He recounted a story of receiving a shipment of coins where the box had been obviously tampered with.\n\nThe 55 BTC missing from his collection were worth about $20,000 at the time they were purchased, and are now worth about $3.5 million, “which is a huge sum in most anyone\u0027s book,” he said. “I\u0027m very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn\u0027t want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me,” he added.\n\nSee also: Why, for Some, Crypto Is the Defining Political Issue of Our Times | Opinion\n\nCoinDesk caught up with Otoh ahead of Consensus to discuss his recent auction of vintage physical bitcoins, early investments in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum’s initial coin offering and how he manages his wealth by diversifying into properties around the world and residing in a tax haven in the British Channel Islands.\n\nCould you give a sense of what you’re talking about at Consensus?\n\nI’m on the panel about physical bitcoins. I\u0027m basically a fill-in for Mike Caldwell, who invented Casascius coins, who couldn\u0027t make it unfortunately.\n\nOh, that\u0027s so cool.\n\nWould be nice to meet him one day. Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee asked if I\u0027d be a substitute for the gap on the panel because I am a large investor.\n\nDo you remember buying your first coin?\n\nYes, very much. It was at the London Bitcoin Conference in 2012. I had just started on bitcoin in the summer of 2011, around July. I remember at the time I met with some German guys – there were all these privacy advocates wearing masks who had a whole bunch of physical coins to sell. I believe it was 10 regular bitcoins and a 10 bitcoin unit piece. The price at the time, with the premium and everything, was $12 a bitcoin.\n\nWhat does Otoh stand for?\n\nIt’s an acronym for “on the other hand.” That\u0027s how it\u0027s usually used. I just adopted it because I find myself, a lot of the time, not necessarily being argumentative but looking at different viewpoints. I thought bitcoin and crypto is also a different way of looking at finance. Nearly everyone had a nickname on the BitcoinTalk forum. That\u0027s the way that came about, but I didn\u0027t give it much thought at the time. It was just the first thing that came into my head.\n\nAre there any particular memories of the early days of Bitcoin that you remember fondly?\n\nFondly? Yes, that must be getting my first coin – that was a big deal. At the time people were still giving away free coins. By the time I joined, word had spread, and it often wasn\u0027t a full coin anymore, just a fraction of a coin, but it was still fun to have my own address and then be sent this little token amount of coins to see how it could function.\n\nAt the time I was traveling between Europe and the States quite a bit and also buying and selling in Europe and the States. With bitcoin, it suddenly became really easy to send money.\n\nA few of the other memories are more traumatic. It\u0027s very easy to mess up. As you learn as you go.\n\nYou\u0027ve probably lost more bitcoins than most people have today.\n\nIf you count the ones that were stolen off me. Like that list I just gave you that I put together from nine years ago. Somewhere out there there is a lost, stolen treasure of a few million dollars.\n\nWhat do you suspect happened there? A rogue employee?\n\nI think it is most likely a rogue U.S. Postal Service employee who just used a box cutter and saw something that looked promising. He probably thought it was Gold Eagles or Silver Eagles or something. I don\u0027t know what the reaction would be, whether they were disgusted to see it was just some weird tokens and threw them away or whether they thought “Oh, this looks cool.”\n\nI’ve always hoped that I’d have a brainstorm and remember if I’ve stashed them away somewhere. But it doesn\u0027t make any sense – I\u0027ve got everything else very well looked after and itemized. A friend of mine whose house I had been staying in at that time remembers receiving a box that was cut open and resealed.\n\nIs there anything that you want to say about the OTOH Collection of Physical Cryptocurrency?\n\nWell, after a decade, I decided it\u0027s time to sell. I\u0027ve never sold any, I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage. Now that I\u0027ve sold all my digital crypto, it seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go. Let other people look after them and enjoy having them.\n\nYou\u0027re also a real estate investor. At this point, do you think it’s better for people to invest in bitcoin or physical property?\n\nI think it’s a mixture of the two. Bitcoin is high-risk, but potentially it has very high returns. And property is a hedge. It\u0027s a safety net. It\u0027s also very hard to steal, whereas bitcoins can be very easy to steal.\n\nIf I was still in my 20s, then I\u0027d probably be keeping a much higher percentage in crypto, but nowadays I like the security of having a bunch of properties and enjoy renovating them.\n\nAre you interested in other digital assets?\n\nIn the past I pretty much have been. I was the largest holder of litecoin (LTC) when it was a few cents. I think I had roughly 600,000. It was the first altcoin, and was quite controversial with Bitcoin Maximalists. They disliked it intensely because they thought it withdrew funds and interest away from Bitcoin. But I was quite convinced from the first time I saw it, it\u0027s impossible for anything to exist without its opposite.\n\nAnd so that paid out very well. After Litecoin, I moved into Dash and was the largest holder of those and helped develop the project in some ways. And then I kind of lost interest and moved onto other things. I was highly recommended Ethereum at a Dutch conference and participated in the ICO. I got 100 bitcoins worth, which was 210,000 ether (ETH). Unfortunately, I sold those way too soon. I made 100% or 200% profit, but I sold them for something like $2. So I will rue the potential $800 million there. Otherwise I\u0027m pretty much fully bitcoin nowadays.\n\nThe way you discussed bitcoin earlier in the conversation you discussed it mostly as a method of transaction. Are you convinced by the arguments that it has properties like gold?\n\nI think it is excellent as an investment. I think that\u0027s its main use at the moment. It’s perhaps the best performing investment in history, and it continues to grow. It is a trillion dollar asset class, and a great way to store value. Satoshi viewed it in the beginning as a hedge against the degenerate behavior of central governments and banks abusing the currencies that we will have to use every day. It\u0027s much more versatile than gold, in that it can be transferred pretty much anywhere around the world from anyone to anyone, instantly, with no armored trucks or anything and next to no fees. It\u0027s quite miraculous really, that it\u0027s come into existence. It\u0027s still very early days, but it really has transformed the world in many many ways.\n\nWhat have been your biggest purchases made with crypto?\n\nI must admit I\u0027ve done very little with buying and selling with crypto. I go from fiat currency into crypto and then back out to fiat currency.\n\nCapital gains taxes make spending crypto sort of annoying, to some extent.\n\nFor many people it would, yes. I\u0027m fortunate that I am based in a tax haven where there isn\u0027t any capital gains tax. I make sure that I\u0027m physically there when I cash any out. So I don\u0027t have that issue. There\u0027s also no income tax.\n\nYou mentioned you have a home in California. How do you balance the tax situation there, where state tax authorities may want to charge you income tax?\n\nI’ve got homes in many countries around the world; it doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m suddenly a tax resident. I make sure I count my days very carefully – I don’t overstay. As long as I\u0027m not here for more than six months of the year, I won\u0027t be liable for any tax. And I don\u0027t do any business here.\n\nDo you mind if I ask what tax haven?\n\nIt’s a little island in the British Channel Islands called Sark. It’s a three square mile island and fairly unique in the world for having next to no tax. You just pay a small proportion of your property tax as a contribution to the kind of upkeep of the island. The main thing about it that\u0027s attractive is you don\u0027t have to keep records of what you\u0027re doing, which would have been hugely complicated when I was converting altcoins into bitcoin and then into other alternative currencies and then back into dollars. I pity the people who had to try and keep these records and then present them to a tax authority – it must be a nightmare.\n\nDid you give up your passport?\n\nNo, I still keep a U.K. passport. I could trade it in for a Guernsey passport, which is the main island in the channel. It\u0027s really just a clone of the U.K.. It has all the same benefits, but I haven\u0027t bothered to do it. It doesn\u0027t really matter what nationality I have. It really only matters where I\u0027m a fiscal resident.\n\nHow would you describe your political views?\n\nWell, like many people, with age I probably have become a little more conservative in some ways. But I\u0027m pretty much a capitalist; I believe that\u0027s a good way for people to behave. I\u0027m not overtly political. I was probably quite anarchist in the past. I just adapt to whatever the majority believes. I am not trying to change things myself in a big way – I’m pretty apolitical.\n\nIs there anything more you want to say about the possible theft of those Casascius coins?\n\nI believe it was 55 bitcoins in value, something like $3.5 million at present value. At the time they were lost or taken they were only worth about $13,000. Still a lot but nothing compared to right now. So I\u0027m very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn\u0027t want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me.\n\nSee also: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: What You Need to Know\n\nOne day, I expect they\u0027ll turn up unless they\u0027ve gone on a destructive route somehow. Everyone can see the addresses; I was really surprised when I checked a couple of weeks ago that they had never been moved and that they hadn\u0027t been peeled. So they\u0027re probably out there somewhere.\n\nLast question, what are you looking forward to at Consensus?\n\nWell, meeting Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee again. They both in their own ways have been very instrumental in helping me with my crypto journey. Charlie Lee by inventing Litecoin, where I did extremely well – probably even better than I did with bitcoin. And Bobby Lee for having BTCC (also known as BTCChina) and the physical coins. He produced physical coins just like Mike\u0027s Casascius coins. I have still got all my BTCC coins. That will be a future auction.\n\nI\u0027ve had quite a few adventures with the physical coins. I had to physically go to Shanghai to pick them up, as they couldn\u0027t be shipped at the time. That was an adventure in itself.\n\nThere\u0027s other people that I know from forums and interacting with on the internet who I\u0027m sure it would be nice to see again in person if I\u0027ve met them at other conferences. It\u0027s a chance to put people together and exchange ideas that if one just sat behind a computer at home, perhaps wouldn\u0027t happen.\n\nSo I\u0027m looking forward to it. It\u0027s quite exciting. It\u0027s my first visit to Texas.\n\n",

    "content": "Futures powerhouse Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) plans to offer spot bitcoin trading to clients as demand for the product mounts among market participants, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.\n\nCME is already the top bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, while offshore, non-regulated Binance dominates the spot market.\n\nThe exchange has held discussions with traders who want to trade bitcoin on a regulated marketplace, the FT reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the talks.\n\nCME\u0027s spot trading business could be run through the EBS currency trading venue in Switzerland, the report added.\n\nThe exchange did not want to comment on the report.\n\nThe spot market will complement the CME’s existing standard and micro futures contracts, which are widely considered a proxy for institutional activity, and help the exchange become more dominant in the crypto market.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "More people are calling for crypto companies and those behind products such as stablecoins to prove they have enough funds to pay their customers.\n\n",
    "content": "Regular banks do not actually hold all of your money. They lend out most of your deposits in an attempt to eke out returns from financial markets. This works, for the most part, because the bank insures deposits with the federal government and because the bank widely diversifies its exposure to risk to ensure that it won’t be caught short in the event of a financial crash.\n\nThis system occasionally fails in traditional finance (see: Lehman) but fails frequently in crypto. The government does not insure deposits to crypto platforms and the platforms often do not manage risk particularly well (see: FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network), making high-risk bets that end in catastrophe.\n\nRead More: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?\n\nAfter so many platforms squandered customer funds, crypto traders are thinking twice about depositing funds to crypto exchanges and lending institutions that “rehypothecate” uninsured deposits – which means they repurpose customer money and lend the funds out in the markets. A safer bet looks like trading on platforms that “fully back” their reserves. But what does this really mean, and should such claims be taken with a pinch of salt?\n\nWhen a financial product, such as a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to “fully back” its reserves, it means that it has stored enough money behind a product, like a stablecoin or a customer’s trading account, to support its worth.\n\nSo, a crypto exchange that “fully backs” its reserves should always be able to pay out customer withdrawals, no matter the state of the market. One such example is Coinbase, which does not lend out its customers’ funds without their express permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to prevent a bank run.\n\nA stablecoin that “fully backs” its reserves is always able to fulfill conversions to the original asset, no matter what. One example is wBTC, or wrapped bitcoin, which holds real bitcoin (BTC) in a cold wallet, then issues an equal amount of an Ethereum-based version of the coin that trades as an ERC-20 token.\n\nFully backed, however, does not necessarily mean that assets are held one to one. That claim refers to the idea that if you, say, give me a dollar, I’ll hold that dollar as a dollar and won’t turn it into something else. Lots of stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like U.S.-dollar stablecoin USDC, are not backed one to one.\n\nThis is because the companies that issue USDC hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in “cash and cash equivalents.” Cash equivalents refer to U.S. Treasury bonds, which is debt issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. These bonds, which pay small returns to holders over time, are close enough to the worth of actual U.S. dollars that the market accepts bonds being essentially worth the same.\n\nBut “fully backed” does not always mean that the backing can withstand financial shocks. U.S. dollar stablecoin tether (USDT) also claims that its reserves are fully backed, but this backing is secured by “other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether [the issuing company] to third parties.” So, USDT may be fully backed, but it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies.\n\nUntil October 2022, USDT was also backed by commercial paper – short-term commercial debt to other companies – and moved those funds to U.S. Treasurys. The concern about the commercial paper was that nobody knew which companies Tether was using to back USDT, so it was impossible to determine the worth of that backing. What’s more, its “fully backed” claim has historically turned out not to be true after it emerged in 2019 that USDT was, at one point, only 74% backed. As wrote the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u0027s Dawn D. Stump, the claim that it was backed to the U.S. dollar was “not 100% true, 100% of the time.”\n\nRead more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its Value\n\nSome stablecoins do not fully back their reserves, which has led to catastrophic results in some cases. The popular algorithmic stablecoin UST, for instance, crashed in spectacular fashion, wiping billions from the market.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, meaning it has more than enough crypto on hand to back its coin. DAI has survived several market crashes.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "At CoinDesk, we’re not just chronicling the business model transformation that digital assets and the blockchain have made possible – we’re actively participating in it.\n\nAt Consensus 2021, a virtual event, we beta-tested DESK, an experiment in using tokenized rewards to incentivize engagement and community-building, garnering positive feedback from our audience. At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019.\n\nIn December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com.\n\nRead More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader Experience\n\nBelow is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information.\n\nDESK is CoinDesk’s social token.\n\nDESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content.\n\nDESK’s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together.\n\nAs of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include:\n\nAt Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as:\n\nDESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum.\n\nPolygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction.\n\nYou’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners.\n\nRead more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your Wallet\n\nYes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account.\n\nIn the Web2 era, content creators – be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers – have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines).\n\nWe’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms.\n\nWe believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal.\n\nWe hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event.\n\nSocial tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants.\n\nInitially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward.\n\nSimply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience.\n\nNo. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone’s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity.\n\nIt is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading.\n\nBy providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We\u0027ve seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization.\n\nNo. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users.\n\nNo. See above.\n\nNo. We\u0027re not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement.\n\nListing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use.\n\nIt’s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests.\n\nSo, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether.\n\nPart of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground.\n\nNo. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless.\n\nCoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon.\n\nBecause DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK\u0027s beta testers.\n\nPiranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept.\n\nAt Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk’s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike.\n\nCoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others.\n\nAs mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used.\n\nNavigate to the DESK dashboard. Select \"Create or Connect Wallet\" and approve the transaction in your wallet.\n\nDepends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com. We will not use this data for anything other than authenticating users when they sign on or distributing DESK rewards, we will never sell it, and we will protect user information assiduously. (See our privacy policy.) DESK transactions will appear on DESK\u0027s page on the Polyscan block explorer, but only the wallet addresses will be displayed.\n\nDESK has no inherent monetary value, but, whether or not you live in a jurisdiction where utility tokens are deemed taxable, you should consult a tax professional if you have concerns.\n\nWe’ll keep a record of airdrops, product developments and other updates critical to DESK’s roadmap and tokenomics in our DESK product blog.\n\nYou can also keep abreast of DESK updates in our Discord server.\n\nThe latest release is only the beginning in developing our Web3 model for DESK on coindesk.com. We\u0027ll be working on improving our wallet functionality, currently in beta, and looking forward to seeing what data and reader feedback reveal as to how to continue improving the experience\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) surged over $71,000 early Tuesday, its highest since early April, as ether surged over 19% to $3,700 after Bloomberg analysts raised the probability that spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) gets approved in the U.S. to 75%.\n\nOther majors chalked out relatively smaller gains, with XRP, Cardano\u0027s ADA, Solana\u0027s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) rising between 3-6%, as per CoinGecko data.\n\nThe sudden move up caused over $260 million in market-wide short liquidations, the biggest since Feb.28. Ether shorts lost over $115 million, followed by bitcoin shorts at just over $99 million, Coinglass data shows.\n\nCrypto exchange Binance logged over $130 million in liquidations, the largest among counterparts, followed by OKX at $118 million and Huobi at $51 million.\n\nShorts are bets against higher price movements. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader\u0027s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader\u0027s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).\n\nMarkets started to rally late Monday as Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised the odds of a spot ether ETF to 75% from the early 20%. Later, CoinDesk reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked aspiring ether exchange-traded fund exchanges to update 19b-4 filings ahead of a key deadline this week.\n\nMarket participants consider the approval of an ether ETF to be a bullish event, opening the floodgates to institutional capital. The spot bitcoin ETF, which started trading in January, has racked up $12 billion in total inflows for BTC, with top trading firms and state funds among its holders.\n\nMeanwhile, some traders expect ether prices to rise further in the coming days.\n\n“Our view is that it is unlikely that spot can settle here, with approval taking us closer to 4k and denial back to 3k,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast. “Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis, suggesting approval is imminent.”\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The upcoming layer-1 takes a hands-on approach to ensuring project security.\n\n",
    "content": "Pseudonymous crypto sleuth Ogle has witnessed plenty of failures while investigating DeFi hacks. He\u0027s part of a cottage industry of security experts who clean up the mess from attackers targeting crypto-finance projects almost daily. His specialty: tracking them down and getting the projects\u0027 money back.\n\nStopping these heists depends on good smart contract code and savvy security. In an interview with CoinDesk, Ogle said it\u0027s also a game of incentives. If an attacker believes the personal cost of their exploit may be too high, they might decide against mounting it at all.\n\nThat ethos is one of the pillars behind Ogle\u0027s upcoming blockchain, called Glue. It plans to fund a security blanket that raises the stakes for black hats and – hopefully – prompts them to take their heisting elsewhere.\n\nGlue has largely flown under the radar this year despite raising at a $1.4 billion valuation in a public token sale. It\u0027s another newcomer layer 1 blockchain at a time when oodles of competitors are vying for the attention of crypto traders and developers.\n\nOgle\u0027s entrant doesn\u0027t have the name-brand appeal of buzzy platforms like Monad and Berachain, two other yet-to-launch blockchain platforms. Instead, it deployed guerilla marketing tactics (like handing out Spy-style manilla envelopes at industry conferences) to stoke intrigue.\n\nIn interviews with CoinDesk Ogle and co-founder SnapShot outlined Glue\u0027s philosophy, security and design. They believe it can appeal to \"regular people who don\u0027t do crypto all day long\" as well as traditional financial professionals \"who can\u0027t come onto a platform where they think they\u0027re going to be rugged.\"\n\n\"We want to build something that actually has a chance of competing with the banks,\" said Glue co-founder Snapshot.\n\nGlue will be built around an activity \"hub\" that aggregates DeFi services for chain users. That level of curation makes Glue markedly different from the construction of most other blockchains. Usually, their users must find what they\u0027re looking for themselves.\n\n\"\u0027Centralization\u0027 is a dirty word in crypto for a good reason but from a UX perspective I think we can have a much more central interface,\" SnapShot said. Ogle said Glue Hub will make on-chain onboarding smooth – \"almost like Coinbase.\"\n\nThe approach targets the 90% of crypto users who SnapShot said stick to centralized exchanges, rather than the \"one million – basically no one\" that he said operate on-chain.\n\nGlue Hub won\u0027t be the only place where users can trade. The chain is permissionless, meaning anyone can build and launch anything for anyone to use. These creations could be integrated with Glue Hub if they pass security checks like audits commissioned by Glue.\n\nAudits have emerged in crypto as a kind of marketing tool in their own right. Projects commission reports from chain-checking specialists who scour their smart contracts to squash money-losing bugs. These checks aren\u0027t definitive – plenty of audited projects still get exploited – but projects tout their clean bills of health as stamps of approval.\n\nThat practice has gone too far, according to Ogle, who said he used to run an auditing firm. Many projects are only willing to be transparent about good-looking reports, and opt to bury the bad, he said.\n\n\"That\u0027s not good for security, for the cryptosphere itself,\" he said.\n\nIn place of this Ogle said high-caliber projects on Glue could be subjected to audits funded by the chain via the Glue Security Fund. This fund will get its money from a tiny tax applied to every transaction, the founders said. It will pay for various efforts to promote security across the entire chain.\n\nAudits don\u0027t always work. Lending protocol Euler lost $200 million to a hack that slipped past 10 audits in two years. Ogle participated in Euler\u0027s recovery as part of the war room that tracked down the hacker and negotiated the return of that money. Ogle claims he has a 65% success rate in getting money back for the 40-odd exploited projects he\u0027s assisted.\n\n\"We have actual funds set aside for me and a group of people to go and chase down anyone who does bad things on\" Glue, Ogle said. He later added that any security service (be they vigilante detectives, auditors or analytics compliance tools) will be able to apply for grants from the GSF. Holders of Glue\u0027s token will determine what\u0027s funded, he said.\n\nThe idea with GSF is to disincentivize hackers from trying to attack Glue projects in the first place. They won\u0027t be able to catch everybody, Ogle said. But if would-be hackers are comparison-shopping targets, they might think twice about hitting the mark that has a war chest ready to pay for chasing them down.\n\nTransactions on Glue will be multi-sig, meaning any attempt to move money from wallets will require multiple approvals from the user. Ogle said this default setup opens the door for third-party services to build tools that increase user security by, say, flagging any money movement that looks out of the ordinary.\n\nThis could save people from losing money to otherwise innocent-looking wallet interactions.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A wave of positive regulatory developments for crypto could be coincidence. Or they could be the Biden Administration reacting to Donald Trump’s recent embrace of the industry.\n\n",
    "content": "The Biden administration’s stance on crypto appears to be softening. I feel comfortable saying this, despite the yearslong “whole-of-government” onslaught against the industry, due to a few key advancements in recent weeks.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.\n\nFirst, and perhaps most significantly, Monday’s news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be gearing up to approve spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This would be a major reversal in fortune for an asset class assumed to be dead-on-arrival, especially considering the securities watchdog has recently been probing prominent Ethereum-related institutions.\n\nWhile much of this is just speculation, based partially on words heard through the grapevine (i.e. “sources with direct knowledge of the situation”), it is telling that the SEC has asked for amended filings from prospect ETH ETF exchanges on an expedited basis. It would be an odd move if the agency planned to reject these applications outright.\n\nJust yesterday, Bloomberg Intelligence placed the odds of an SEC approval of spot ETH ETFs at 25%. Today, it stands at 75% likely that these products – which would likely draw institutional capital into the second-largest crypto asset by market cap, in the same way bitcoin benefited from its own cluster of ETFs – will launch this year. (The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck’s spot ether ETF on May 23.)\n\nSecondly, last week a bipartisan bill called the Deploying American Blockchains Act of 2023 was passed with a margin of 334 to 79 by House representatives. While modest in scope, the bill would enable the Secretary of Commerce, currently Gina Raimondo, “to take actions necessary and appropriate to promote the competitiveness of the United States” in the blockchain industry.\n\nSee also: Why the SEC Shouldn\u0027t Classify ETH as a Security | Opinion\n\nThis comes ahead of the Senate’s vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), considered to be the most significant piece of crypto-specific legislation with the greatest likelihood of actually becoming law. As my colleague Nikhilesh De astutely points out:\n\n“House Democratic leaders on the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees told their members that while they oppose the FIT21 bill, they wouldn\u0027t actively whip against it – in other words, they essentially told their members to vote how they see fit.”\n\nThis is similar to recent votes in the House and Senate to repeal the SEC\u0027s controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which imposed severe capital requirements on crypto custodians and all but foreclosed the possibility of banks moving into the space (and strongly opposed by both the crypto and TradFi communities).\n\nThe theory is, when President Joseph Biden vowed to veto the measure to repeal SAB121, he cleared a path for congress members – including prominent Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-OR) – to vote their conscience.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Biden will veto the measure, despite the fact that the independent Government Accountability Office (GAO) said the SEC inappropriately imposed the guidance. However, the important thing here is that sane, bipartisan, crypto rulemaking is possible, despite the opposition of figures like arch crypto skeptic Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).\n\nSpeaking of which, Warren may be losing influence in the Biden Administration. Yesterday, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Martin Gruenberg announced he would be stepping down after the Senate Banking Committee Chair, Sherod Brown, called for his resignation.\n\nWhile the move does not directly pertain to crypto, it is worth mentioning that Gruenberg is a known confidant of Sen. Warren – and their view of crypto is largely cut from the same cloth. Under Gruenberg’s leadership, for instance, the FDIC took a hard line against crypto during the financial crisis in 2023 that brought down three medium-sized banks.\n\nAlthough it largely cited poor risk-management and incompetent leadership, the FDIC also said Signature Bank’s “association with and reliance on crypto industry deposits” was a major cause for its failure in its report. That same year the agency officially added crypto to its annual report on risks facing U.S. banks and began entering into “robust supervisory discussions” with the firms under its charge.\n\nFurther, Castle Island Ventures co-founder Nic Carter considers Gruenberg to be one of the major “architects” of what he called Operation Choke Point 2.0, or a series of maneuvers by the U.S. government to systemically cripple the crypto industry (the name is a callback to the Obama era effort to de-bank unsavory industries). Indeed, following the collapse of FTX, the White House issued its first fact sheet related to crypto, essentially calling for a crackdown.\n\nSee also: The Reality Behind the Crypto Banking Crackdown | Opinion\n\nTo be sure, there are a few major caveats to consider here. First of all, Gruenberg resigned under political pressure following a Wall Street Journal report on widespread evidence of sexual harassment at the FDIC. The septuagenarian himself wasn’t accused of harassment, however he did allow a toxic workplace culture to fester – which is why Sen. Brown called for his ouster (which Sen. Warren called “politically motivated”).\n\nAll of this is to say that crypto is not a motivating factor here, although some political commentators are looking at the Gruenberg situation as a sign of the Warren faction’s waning influence. For instance, John Deaton, who is challenging Sen. Warren for her senatorial seat this November, said it was “shameful” how Warren “circled the wagons to keep one of her disgraced puppets in place.”\n\nIt’s also important to note that Congress is not the White House, and the White House is not the SEC. In other words, there is no real reason to assume that the Biden administration is suddenly telling either Gary Gensler or legislators to, like, take it easy on crypto. These are all discrete events, but they’re all positive developments for crypto.\n\nRegarding the possibility of ETH ETF approval, the going idea is that the SEC was resistant because it wasn’t having productive meetings with prospective issuers. And “the fact that their meetings became more recently productive doesn\u0027t necessarily mean there was a policy reversal,” as CoinDesk policy expert Jesse Hamilton said.\n\nBut what if there really were a driving force behind all of these developments? What explains the widespread sea change? And why would a Dem-controlled government suddenly become pro-crypto now?\n\n“The backdrop to all of this is an election where the Republican party\u0027s standard-bearer, former President Donald Trump, has explicitly made an appeal to crypto voters as part of his strategy,” De said.\n\nIndeed, the former president has seemingly intuited that the crypto contingent is something of a well-heeled political force, and has been currying favor. There are a few cynics who argue the billionaire real estate developer is primarily motivated by his bags (Trump has issued several NFT series, and holds a fair amount of ETH and other tokens), but that seems needlessly narrow a view.\n\nThe alignment makes perfect sense: Crypto gets peoples’ attention. And Trump likes to get attention. Crypto also gets a certain type of person angry, and it just so happens that these are the same people Trump likes to get angry. Crypto advocates also like powerful people willing to speak positively about crypto. And Trump likes his praise.\n\nPassionate crypto advocates like Messari founder Ryan Selkis (a Consensus speaker, by the way) have been saying for years that the industry needs to organize into a coherent political block. In recent months, this has become more of a reality. Experts say crypto-focused political action committees (PACs) have more influence in Washington D.C. than ever, and are spending tens of millions of dollars across the country to influence elections up and down the ballot.\n\nSee also: Bitcoin Is Free and Fair but Not Progressive | Opinion\n\nAnd while both parties could conceivably claim the “apolitical” crypto narrative for their own, there is something to the idea that the industry’s somewhat contradictory situation of being both rooted in Occupy Wall Street-era populism while also most frequently being associated with the “hilariously rich” is undeniably Trumpian. To some extent, I’m surprised it took so long for Trump to come around to it.\n\nWhich gets us to the main point: Why now? It is clear that Trump has come out in support of crypto because it is a wedge issue he can use against his rival, President Biden. While the general public is not likely clued into the nitty gritty politics of crypto regulation, a surprising amount of registered voters hold crypto and have a positive sentiment towards it. In particular, nearly 25% of self-identified independent voters (i.e. the key “swing voter”) have bought crypto. And that number will only increase over time, especially following the launch of crypto ETFs.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, because Trump has set himself up as an oppositional figure to the Biden administration’s slow boiling war against crypto (which has literally won over at least a handful of voters who despise his other policies), the easiest way for Biden to solve the issue is to either do a 180 on crypto himself or simply make it less of a problem.\n\nThis is compounded by the fact that, while the majority of Americans still do not interact with or care that much about crypto, there have been a series of missteps by regulators that have garnered something almost akin to sympathy for the industry. The biggest bloody nose being the SEC’s handling of approving bitcoin ETFs, which was called “arbitrary and capricious” by an appeals court.\n\nBut there is a growing sense that this same cavalier and biased view carries through all of the Biden administration’s crypto efforts. Americans want crypto to be safe and well regulated, they want consumer protections; they do not want arcane debates about whether an asset is a security.\n\nMoreover, it is conceivable that a strong reaction to the industry’s cataclysmic failures in 2022 was politically advantageous but now that prices are climbing again a heavy handed approach seems both like a waste of government resources and potentially overreaching. This is to say nothing of the fact that provoking the crypto industry always garners backlash from insiders.\n\nAgain, all of this is mere speculation: there is no direct evidence that Biden is reversing course. It is significant that a major piece of crypto legislation has made it this far, that ETH ETFs being approved is back in play and that Trump has won over the “single issue” crypto voters. Consider this a vibes analysis, a theory that can never be proven but can grow stronger if more positive advancements like this happen.\n\nAt the end of the day, politics, like crypto, really is all about vibes.\n\n",

    "content": "The exchanges that want to list and trade shares of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds are abruptly being asked by regulators to update key filings related to these products.\n\nExchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, three people familiar with the situation told CoinDesk, suggesting they may be moving to approve these applications ahead of a key deadline this Thursday.\n\nThat doesn\u0027t mean the ETFs will be authorized, though. Would-be issuers also need their S-1 applications approved before the products could begin trading. SEC could take an indefinite amount of time to approve the S-1 documents, one person familiar with the matter said, as it isn\u0027t tied to a deadline.\n\nOne company in talks with the SEC said it feels like it might be on the right track for approval, in a turnaround from feeling some weeks ago that the SEC was dragging its feet, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds for the approval of a spot ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday after hearing chatter that the SEC could be taking a more favorable stance towards the applications.\n\nThey later corrected their statement, saying that the odds were related to the 19b-4 approvals. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck spot ether ETF on May 23rd.\n\nThe SEC has been investigating whether ether, the chief native asset to the Ethereum blockchain, is a security, launching a formal inquiry after the network moved from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism.\n\nIf ether is deemed to be a security by the SEC, that may be one reason for the regulator to reject the spot ether ETF applications.\n\nOne test of the agency\u0027s view on whether ETH is a security has newly emerged at Prometheum. The special purpose broker announced Monday it had soft-launched its ether custody service. The company eventually intends to launch custody and trading services for other digital assets – importantly, assets that are treated as securities in the U.S., not commodities.\n\nRead more: Ether Jumps 10% to $3.4K After Bloomberg Ups Odds of Spot ETF Approval\n\nUPDATE (May 20, 2024, 21:10 UTC): Adds additional information and context.\n\n",

It surged 14% on Tuesday as the Trump campaign said it would begin to accept crypto donations, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and meme coins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB).\n\nFrom all this, some holders of the MAGA meme coin – the first experiment in a new category of tokens called PoliFi, which has a collective market cap of $749 million – have seen returns of over 1,600%.\n\nOne such address is sitting on over $5.5 million worth of the token.\n\nSeveral addresses purchased low six-figures in TRUMP tokens and are now sitting on unrealized gains of over $1 million. They are gradually trimming their holdings but not selling in a manner that could cause a sudden price dump. As such, these sales were made before Tuesday’s campaign donation announcement.\n\nHowever, recent buyers of the TRUMP token are posting a poor return on investment and have a low overall win rate, the data showed.\n\nMeanwhile, the value of TRUMP holdings sent to a wallet linked to the actual Donald Trump has risen to nearly $5 million.\n\nA wallet supposedly linked to Trump received $7,100 of TRUMP from the meme coin’s developers between August and October 2023.\n\nSending tokens to a wallet linked to popular entities is sometimes used as a marketing strategy by meme coin makers, as they can attract eyeballs – and galvanize investor interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "What Is \u0027Web5\u0027 and How Is it Different From Web3?",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "There are a few things that make Jack Dorsey’s vision for Web5 distinct, including not wanting to completely replace Web2 but work with it.\n\n",
    "content": "The world is still getting its collective head around Web3 – a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls \"Web5\"?\n\nIt turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey’s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises “an extra decentralized web platform.”\n\nTo land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 \u003d 5.\n\nWeb5’s core idea is to “put you in control of your data and identity” – a core tenet of Web3’s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet’s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS.\n\nDorsey’s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data “captive in app silos,” Web5 pushes for “a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.”\n\nThere are three pillars at Web5’s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017.\n\nSo, what’s new here – apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey’s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any “special utility tokens or subjective consensus” that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service.\n\nIn doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin’s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5’s nascent community already balked at TBD’s attempt to trademark the term Web5.\n\nThe other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5’s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user’s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform.\n\nTBD’s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to “help her visualize her itinerary.” Again, the idea is to tie data that’s usually locked inside centralized services – something TBD calls “a massive, unworkable mess” – to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user’s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes.\n\nWill it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that’s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS).\n\nOne of the key things that distinguish TBD’s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it’s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5’s announcement: “Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It’s like a high school student saying ‘yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it’s meant to be.’ It’s naive.”\n\n",

    "content": "The market capitalization of programmable blockchain Solana\u0027s sol (SOL) token could exceed that of rival Ethereum\u0027s ether (ETH) during the next bullish cycle, one crypto observer said in December.\n\nThis week, the market has shown how Herculean the task would be: The ether price surged more than 19% on Monday, adding $70 billion to its market cap for a total of $439 billion, according to data source TradingView. That\u0027s a gain equivalent to almost 90% of SOL\u0027s market value in just one day.\n\nThe surge followed renewed hopes that a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be approved in the U.S. Analysts say the gap between ether and its rivals like SOL will widen in the coming months as a potential spot ETF launch open the token to mainstream institutional adoption. So far, only bitcoin has had that privilege.\n\nAt press time, ether was the world\u0027s second-largest digital asset, boasting a market cap of $453 billion, exceeded only by bitcoin\u0027s (BTC) $1.38 trillion. Sol, meanwhile, ranked fifth with a market value of $82 billion.\n\n\"Near-term ETH outlook is incredibly bullish. Let\u0027s not overcomplicate it,\" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an email. \"The ETF announcement is a near black swan even to (most) investors, markets dramatically short-to-underweight ETH, much of ETH liquidity is locked in staking, and the macro backdrop is favourable,\"\n\nSince its inception in 2015, Ethereum has been the world\u0027s leading smart contract blockchain, powering over 4,000 decentralized applications. It\u0027s home to some of the most critical decentralized finance protocols like Uniswap, AAVE and tokenization initiatives like BlackRock\u0027s BUIDL. Moreover, Ethereum has never experienced a Solana-like outage.\n\nStill, there have been instances, particularly during bull runs, when traders shifted to Solana to bypass Ethereum\u0027s network congestion and higher transactions costs. For instance, Solana\u0027s share in global trading volume on decentralized exchanges rose early this year thanks to the meme coin frenzy. That spurred talks of SOL eventually overtaking ETH.\n\nIf the ETH ETF speculation and recent price action is anything to go by, such talks appear premature.\n\n",

    "content": "This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nBitcoin rose above $71,000 during the European morning after analysts saw the possibility of an ether ETF being approved in the U.S. improving. BTC has climbed nearly 6% in the last 24 hours, eclipsing $71,000 for the first time since early April. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which offers a broad measurement of the digital asset market, rose more than 8.5% while ETH jumped almost 20% to over $3,700. The market movements caused more than $260 million in short liquidations, the most since Feb. 28. Ether shorts lost over $115 million, followed by bitcoin shorts at just over $99 million, Coinglass data shows.\n\nETH has been buoyed by favorable regulatory developments that seem to indicate increasing chances of spot ether ETFs being approved by the SEC after the regulator asked exchanges to update 19b-4 filings, which propose rule changes. As a result, the ether implied volatility curve, which shows market expectations of future volatility across different strike prices and expirations, flattened as 25-delta risk reversals hit year-to-date highs above 18%, and traders heavily bought $4,000 calls for 24 May and 31 May, Presto Research analysts wrote. A Polymarket contract asking if an ether ETF would be approved by May 31 jumped from 10 cents to 55 cents, representing a 55% chance that approval will take place by then.\n\nMeme coins on the Ethereum ecosystem like MOG and PEPE surged on the increasing likelihood of ether ETFs being approved. Meme tokens are often seen as a leveraged way to bet on the growth of their underlying blockchain. MOG rose nearly 50% while PEPE climbed over 20%. “Established memes are generally high beta for the native token of the chain they’re on, and Mog has established itself as a winner on Ethereum,” Viro, a Mog core team member, said in an interview over Telegram. “I think the market sees that there’s quite a lot of room to catch up to Pepe, and that’s why you see the outperformance. If you think memes are good beta; you’ll go for the higher caps like pepe or you’ll slide further down the curve for mog.”\n\n- Omkar Godbole\n\n",

    "content": "Things appear to be moving ahead of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to potentially approve an important filing related to the launch of a spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nCboe, an exchange associated with five of the issuers of a potential spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), published its amended 19b-4 filings in response to feedback from regulators. The applicants include Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares and Franklin Templeton.\n\nExchanges supporting various applicants filed revised forms with the SEC earlier on Tuesday, two individuals familiar with the situation told CoinDesk.\n\nOfficials with the SEC asked exchanges to refile using universal comments – where they all use the same wording – one individual told CoinDesk.\n\nSeveral people told CoinDesk across Monday and Tuesday that SEC officials haven\u0027t explicitly said they were approving the applications, but that the feedback was still significant. A final approval on the applications is still not guaranteed, but the agency asking for revisions on the 19b-4 forms suggests progress is being made. One of the individuals told CoinDesk they expect multiple approvals this week.\n\nWhile the 19b-4 forms might be approved as soon as this Thursday – when the first one, an application by VanEck and Cboe, faces a final deadline – the spot ether ETFs can\u0027t launch until the SEC also approves the S-1 forms filed by the issuers themselves. There appears to be less movement on this front than with the 19b-4 filings. A few applicants have already begun revising their S-1 forms, however.\n\nIt appears that the SEC won’t allow issuers to stake the potential ETFs, which several applicants, including Grayscale and Fidelity, hoped to do. Both asset managers on Tuesday filed an amended S-1 registration statement removing staking from their documents.\n\nEther\u0027s price traded around $3,790 as of press time according to CoinGecko, up 3.8% over the last 24 hours and maintaining a $600 jump from its price on Monday before optimism for an ETF approval first resurfaced.\n\n",

    "summary": "One trading desk has seen an uptick in call buying activity with targets of as high as $120,000 for December 2024.\n\nBitcoin’s price could reach $74,000 in the coming weeks amid softer U.S. inflation figures and institutional demand, which favors riskier assets.\n\nLarge asset managers like Millennium and Schonfeld have invested in bitcoin spot ETFs, indicating growing institutional interest.\n\nSelling pressure from short-term is easing, some on-chain analysts said in a Thursday report.\n\n",
    "content": "Bullish sentiment for riskier assets following soft inflation figures could propel bitcoin (BTC) prices toward the $74,000 mark in the coming days as institutional demand continues to grow, Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a note early Thursday.\n\nThe softer-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggering a breakout for BTC. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March.\n\nSuch a move, coupled with demand from traditional finance, could see bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,700.\n\n“We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of nearly $74,000,” QCP traders said. “The desk saw sizeable buyers of $100K-$120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot.”\n\n“Institutional demand for bitcoin continues to grow, with large asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld investing approximately 3% and 2% of their AUM into the BTC spot ETF,” they added.\n\nMultiple filings on Wednesday showed that several big-name funds, such as Millenium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios.\n\nMeanwhile, some analysts say the selling pressure on bitcoin appears to have eased off, citing on-chain and exchange data.\n\n“Short-term Bitcoin holders are selling at basically zero profit and traders are depleting their unrealized profits in the last few months,” CryptoQuant analysts shared in a Thursday report. “Bitcoin balances at OTC desks stabilizing, which suggests there is less Bitcoin supply coming into the market to sell via these entities.”\n\nThe firm defines short-term traders as addresses that hold bitcoin for less than 155 days and are likely to capitalize on short-term price movements.\n\nA breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility. Since March, the market has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000, with the halving event in April not providing the expected boost due to a general lack of market catalysts, traders have previously said.\n\nHigher risk appetite for token bets showed signs of beginning earlier this week after an X post by retail trader Keith Gill sent some meme stocks and meme coins surging.\n\nGill\u0027s online persona and investment strategies contributed to a short squeeze on video game retailer GameStop’s stock in 2021, and his first post on social application X in three years was considered by some to be a sign of market volatility in the months ahead.\n\n",

    "summary": "“There exists a large, untapped pool of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem that remains dormant,” Wintermute’s OTC desk told CoinDesk.\n\nBitcoin’s halving event could increase bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting tokens such as STX, RUNE, and ORDI to rise.\n\nBitcoin-based meme coins, NFTs, and Ordinals could form part of a “barbell strategy” comprised of both technical and non-serious projects, some traders say.\n\n",
    "content": "Bitcoin’s (BTC) much anticipated halving event later this month could see a flurry of bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting upside on both technical and meme coin projects.\n\nHalving reduces the rate at which new coins are created and lowers the available new supply. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. This event has historically preceded a bull market for the token.\n\nCrypto traders say participants seek a “reason to buy” as money narratives continuously shift in the current bullish environment and they may turn their focus on the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming weeks.\n\n“There exists a large, untapped pool of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem that remains dormant, and surprisingly few listed assets that traders can use to gain exposure to the narrative,” the OTC desk of trading firm Wintermute told CoinDesk over email.\n\n“Should capital begin to rotate into the Bitcoin ecosystem, tokens like $RUNE, $STX, and $ORDI could benefit significantly and outperform,” they added.\n\nTHORChain’s RUNE and Stack’s STX have been among the top-performing tokens in the past year, CoinGecko data shows, tracking a bitcoin rise. Meme coin ordi (ORDI) – a nod to the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin – has surged over 2,500% since its September issuance.\n\nMeanwhile, Bartosz Lipinski is the founder of the crypto trading platform Cube.Exchange said in an email that meme coins and the upcoming Runes protocol could rile up risky bets in the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n“Ethereum’s high costs and significant network congestion will cause it to take a backseat as Bitcoin-based projects, like Rune, will redirect meme coin hype to the Bitcoin ecosystem because of the novelty,” Lipinski said. “The BRC-20 (Ordinals NFT) standard is likely to be overtaken by Runes, which is expected to launch on the day of the halving.”\n\n“Runes will aim to replace the standard with fungible tokens, which will enable the efficient creation of meme coins to compete with projects on Base and Solana,” he added, referring to the ongoing frenzy for non-serious tokens in the two ecosystems.\n\nOrdinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.\n\nOrdinal volumes were higher than those of usual leaders Ethereum and Solana in the past week, as reported, led by NodeMonkes and Pups. Non-fungible token (NFT) on other networks buying and selling activity declined 95% across all networks in the same period, suggestive of an isolated interest in Ordinals.\n\n",

Next-generation cryptography.\n\nThese are just a handful of the cutting-edge blockchain tech topics on the agenda at CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus 2024 conference, which runs Wednesday, May 29, through Friday, May 31, in Austin, Texas.\n\nFor blockchain developers, it\u0027s red meat. For others, it may sound unfamiliar. For everyone, including those somewhere in between, the three days are packed with opportunities to learn about the hottest crypto tech on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos and XRP Ledger – from the world\u0027s top experts.\n\nWe took a spin through the agenda to identify stages and sessions likely to interest blockchain developers and people interested in the technology.\n\nIn general there are six broad categories of relevant programming:\n\nThe overall Consensus agenda is pretty sprawling. In terms of the blockchain tech highlights, the following would represent our picks.\n\nWednesday:\n\n1:45 p.m. (Mainstage): Joe Lubin of Consensys discusses Ethereum with Consensus Chair Michael Casey.\n\n2:45 p.m. (Mainstage): Emin Gün Sirer, CEO, Ava Labs, the primary developer of Avalanche, joins a panel on what blockchain can do for AI, and what AI can do for crypto.\n\n3 p.m. (Town Square): Bryan Bishop, early Bitcoin coder (and now a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal editor), discusses the early days on a panel with other crypto OGs.\n\nThursday:\n\n12:45 p.m. (Mainstage): David Marcus, former head of the Facebook/Meta Diem/Libra, talks about Lightspark, his digital-payments startup based on Bitcoin\u0027s Lightning Network.\n\n1:15 p.m. (Mainstage): Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, talks about his project\u0027s work with the global banking-payments network Swift, in a panel moderated by CoinDesk\u0027s Sam Kessler.\n\n4:15 p.m. (Town Square): John Adler, co-founder and chief research officer of Celestia Labs, and Austin Federa, head of strategy for Solana Foundation, discuss whether modular or monolithic blockchains are the better way to scale.\n\nFriday:\n\n10 a.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen discusses where DeFi is headed.\n\n10:40 a.m. (Mainstage): Raj Gokal, co-founder and president of Solana Labs, discusses the network\u0027s future and the upcoming release of the Firedancer software designed to improve performance.\n\n11 a.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): Helium CEO Abhay Kumar speaks on a panel about the future of \"decentralized physical infrastructure networks,\" or DePIN (formerly referred to as Internet of Things, or IoT).\n\n11:30 a.m. (Mainstage): Casey Rodarmor, the developer who almost single-handedly created the two most impactful protocols launched atop Bitcoin in the past two years – Ordinals and Runes – talks about what comes next and his vision for the oldest and largest blockchain.\n\n11:45 a.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): CoinDesk\u0027s Margaux Nijkerk leads a discussion on liquid staking and restaking.\n\n12 p.m. (Town Square): AMA with Casey Rodarmor\n\n12:15 p.m. (Startup Village): Injective co-founder Eric Chen discusses his vision for the future of finance.\n\n3 p.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): Gauntlet co-founder Tarun Chitra speaks on a panel about \"de-risking DeFi,\" from preventing smart-contract bugs and rug pulls to dealing with treasury management strategies and audits.\n\nFor blockchain developers and VC investors, this is probably where you\u0027ll end up spending a lot of time.\n\nWednesday\n\n10:30 a.m. XRP Ledger\n\n11 a.m. Avalanche\n\n12:30 p.m. Chainlink\n\n1:30 p.m. Solana\n\n2:45 p.m. NEAR\n\n3:45 p.m. Stellar\n\nThursday\n\n10:30 a.m. Ethereum/L2s half day.\n\n1:30 p.m. Bitcoin half day.\n\nFriday\n\n10 a.m. Panel session on appchain stacks.\n\n11:30 a.m. Panel session on zero-knowledge proofs.\n\n12:30 p.m. Coinbase security with Jeff Lunglhofer, CISO\n\n1 p.m. Sei\n\n1:30 p.m. Cosmos (on \"Bitcoinization)\n\n2 p.m. Microsoft\n\nWednesday\n\n11:30 a.m. Alchemy Engineering Lead Rohan Thomare talks about \"building the next killer dapp\" and \"how to simplify Web3 user experience with account abstraction.\"\n\n1:30 p.m. Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder of RedStone Oracles, gives a crash course on \"Pull vs. Push Oracle.\"\n\n3:30 p.m. Blockdaemon CEO and founder Konstantin Richter talks about how institutions can navigate the evolving landscape of restaking.\n\n4:30 p.m. Akash Network founder Greg Osuri explains how \"decentralization is saving AI.\"\n\nFriday\n\n1:30 p.m. Solana head of developer relations Jacob Creech explains \"how to build consumer apps on a blockchain.\"\n\nAI Summit - 10:10 a.m to 3:30 p.m. on Friday, Gen C Stage.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Known for her fiery dissenting opinions, \"Crypto Mom\" discusses how the SEC operates, why she wants to see crypto thrive and her \"Safe Harbor\" proposal to allow projects to decentralize.\n\n",
    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is not a monolithic institution. Look no further than Hester Peirce (a.k.a. Crypto Mom), who is currently serving her second term as one of five overseeing commissioners. Over the past several years, Peirce has made a reputation as a defender of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology — writing innumerable dissenting opinions regarding the many legal actions the SEC has waged against crypto protocols and companies.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce will speak at Consensus 2024 this May. Grab your pass here.\n\nTo some extent, Peirce’s disagreements with SEC Chair Gary Gensler stem from their varying philosophical and political beliefs. Peirce, a Republican and member of the Federalist Society, thinks the government should have a limited hand in regulating commerce. Whereas Gensler, who swims in Democratic circles, is often harder to pin down. While Gensler has seemingly evolving opinions on crypto (having appeared as a blockchain supporter while teaching the subject at MIT), Pierce has remained steadfast in her support of economic innovation.\n\n“It’s a fundamental American principle that people are free to make choices. The government is not there to protect people from their own choices,” Peirce told CoinDesk in an interview. This view colors Peirce’s opinions on whether the SEC should block spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs), go after U.S.-based exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken as well as what role agency should play in overseeing crypto markets.\n\nCoinDesk caught up with Commissioner Peirce ahead of Consensus 2024, where she’s scheduled to speak this May, to discuss the SEC’s enforcement actions, her distaste of Big Banks and where U.S. crypto regulation first went wrong.\n\nHi mom. To start off with an easy one, would you be able to describe the fundamental split in opinion that you have with SEC Chair Gary Gensler?\n\nIt\u0027s not an easy question.\n\nJust to start out, look, the views I represent and will reflect are my own views, not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow commissioners, so I can\u0027t speak for anyone else at the commission.\n\nAre you talking about crypto specifically or about the universe of issues?\n\nI wanted to maybe widen the scope. What are your fundamental political or philosophical differences?\n\nSo, in terms of philosophy — I have the view that I don\u0027t necessarily know what\u0027s best for other people. We have our statutory mandates that we have to implement. But within those mandates, we\u0027re often given discretion. And if we have discretion, my preference is to say, well, let\u0027s let market participants make a decision about what they want to do. Now, sometimes there\u0027s a reason that we have to step into the middle of a transaction, and say “No, you can\u0027t do that” or “Yes, you can do it, but you have to do it in this particular way.” But we better have a really good reason for stepping into the middle of that transaction.\n\nSee also: SEC in \u0027Enforcement-Only Mode\u0027 for Crypto, Commissioner Peirce Says\n\nIt’s a fundamental American principle that people are free to make choices. The government is not there to protect people from their own choices. It\u0027s there to protect people if someone else harms them, but not to make their life decisions for them.\n\nIn the past, you\u0027ve been critical of big banks but have also argued that the regulatory response to the Great Financial Crisis was offbase. I’m wondering if this somehow connects to your interest in crypto?\n\nI think my interest in crypto stems from a couple of things. First, I think it\u0027s a good test for how we handle innovation — or maybe a bad test in the sense that I think we\u0027re not passing it. Crypto came to us with a lot of new players and a lot of new ideas. I think we should have figured out how to work with these new players and figure out a way how they could do what they wanted to do in a way that would be compliant, but also allowed them to move forward.\n\nThere is a connection in the sense that when I look at the financial crisis — a lot of people have looked at it and come to different conclusions about the causes — one of the things going on was poor regulatory design. A regulatory design that led to everyone making the same dumb mistake at the same time. One way to address that is to build resilience into the system, and having heterogeneity in the system is a good way to build resilience. There are some interesting concepts within crypto that allow for more decentralization of the financial system.\n\nSo yes, in that sense, there\u0027s a connection. But do I think that the decentralized future is going to replace centralized intermediaries in the financial system? My prediction would be not; people want to deal with a centralized intermediary. But I think that there will be a role for decentralized finance. Maybe it\u0027s in the background. Maybe it’s more than that. I predict most people will access it through a centralized intermediary. I could be wrong.\n\nYou don\u0027t have to answer this question, but do you hold cryptocurrencies?\n\nBecause I work on these issues all the time. I do not, and would not even if I could. I feel like there\u0027d be a conflict. If you work on these issues, you can\u0027t have crypto, basically. I\u0027m speaking only for what the rules are that apply to me.\n\nA question from my editor: Prometheum; what\u0027s going on there? Is this an example of the SEC picking winners?\n\nI\u0027m not going to speak to any particular entity. Nice try.\n\nThat\u0027s fair enough. Your Safe Harbor proposal is common sense, but in the intervening years since you\u0027ve published it, I think it\u0027s arguably become clear that maybe three years is too short of a time for protocols to decentralize. Solana, Cardano, even Ethereum to an extent have centralized entities directing development — the non-profit organizations founded alongside the network. Do you think we should be thinking about decentralization on a longer timeline? Decades?\n\nAgain, decentralization is not an end in itself. It is the right thing in certain circumstances. However, sometimes having a centralized entity is the right thing. We should all take a step back and think about what we\u0027re trying to achieve. And fundamentally, what we need to achieve is the ability for people to know whether or not they\u0027re dealing with a security, so when they do something or sell something they understand whether it’s a securities offering.\n\nThey need to know that in the primary and secondary markets. Then, if we decide that certain crypto assets are securities, or that it doesn\u0027t make sense to adjust the rules, there is a sensible framework that makes sense for crypto assets. Does it make sense to set up some sort of disclosure regime for centralized entities? That\u0027s really a congressional decision. But we can\u0027t even really have these conversations at the SEC right now because the conclusion is just to apply exactly the same rules that apply to stocks and be done with it — and I just don\u0027t think that works.\n\nBut just taking a step back and thinking about what we\u0027re really trying to solve might take some pressure off the decentralization question.\n\nHow closely do you or the other four commissioners work with the Enforcement Division. Do you suggest cases to litigate?\n\nSo, just to give you a sense of how things work on the enforcement side. As with the rulemaking side, it\u0027s the staff that does the bulk of the work. They consider a rule and will propose it for us and we\u0027ll consider it. Often the vote happens at a public, open meeting. With enforcement actions, we also get recommendations. Typically, the staff will recommend authorizing an enforcement action and settling it at the same time. So we often don\u0027t see the case until the end, and are not involved in the guts of the matter. So we\u0027re either going to authorize the division to sue or authorize you to sue and settle with them on the same day. Most of our cases settle like that right away. The voting happens in a process called seriatim, where we\u0027re just voting on the papers, or we vote at a meeting where we have a discussion, but those meetings are, as you might guess, not open to the public.\n\nSo in a way, if there was a change in the presidential administration in the upcoming election, then the current enforcement regime could continue, more or less, as is?\n\nI think these are great questions because the structure of the agency is a little strange. Strange in the sense that it\u0027s not like a lot of other agencies that have a single head. But while there are five of us commissioners, Chair Gensler does have the authority to set the rulemaking agenda and staff also report to him. The chair can certainly push the direction that things go, but you\u0027re right, it\u0027s not as if when a new chairman comes in all the existing enforcement investigations just stop. The agency is designed to keep going.\n\nWould you take the job if Trump or Tulsi were elected?\n\nThat\u0027s not even on the radar.\n\nNo?\n\nYeah, I\u0027m focused on The Now, and trying to try to shift us to a better place. I\u0027ve been here for six years, and it\u0027s very discouraging to see that we have not taken a productive path at all. To me, it\u0027s inevitable that we\u0027ll have to take a productive path at some point — so why not start now? What are we waiting for?\n\nThis isn\u0027t a question about the present, but I am curious in what ways the agency has changed since your first couple of stints during the early 2000s at the SEC?\n\nOver the years we\u0027ve gotten progressively more prescriptive in our rulemaking approach. An issue I raised in a speech last week is that we\u0027ve gotten less willing to engage on some of the difficult issues with the staff and the public. That has not been a positive set of changes.\n\nIs there any reason to believe or to hope that the spot market ETH ETF process won\u0027t unfold similarly to what happened with the spot market bitcoin ETFs?\n\nI can\u0027t talk about that one because we\u0027ve got some applications under consideration.\n\nDo you think the 2017 DAO Report set the crypto regulation off on the wrong foot?\n\nYeah, I do. Because I think that the facts of the DAO Report are different from the facts of most crypto offerings that we see, right? The facts were unique. And I just don\u0027t think that the legal analysis that we\u0027ve applied to thinking about tokens has been helpful for really getting to the crux of the issue.\n\nSee also: SEC Blasts \u0027Purportedly Decentralized\u0027 DAOs in $1.7M Barnbridge Settlement\n\nSo if I could rewind — I wasn\u0027t here at the time of the DAO report, though I’ve learned a lot in that time — I would change the way we approach things.\n\nDo you agree with Judge Failla’s interpretation in the XRP case, that tokens aren\u0027t necessarily securities, but when you sell them to qualified investors it’s an investment contract?\n\nWell, again, because that\u0027s litigation, I don\u0027t want to talk about any particular judge\u0027s opinion. But as I have said, in other contexts, when you think about an investment contract, whether it\u0027s a digital asset or some other kind of a tangible asset, the asset itself is not the security on its own. It’s when you offer that asset along with an investment contract that’s what makes a security a security. It becomes the object at the center of the investment contract. But you still have to think about those two things as distinct. The orange groves in Howey were not on their own securities.\n\nYour dissenting opinions are often quite artful. Was it your idea or your co-author Mark Uyeda’s idea to include a play in the ShapeShift document?\n\nI can\u0027t answer that question either.\n\nThanks again for your time.\n\nWell, I appreciate you taking the time and I hope you have a great afternoon.\n\n",

    "title": "CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger on Overzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative Action",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The commodities regulator has been clear about the dangers of regulating a burgeoning industry through enforcement actions.\n\n",
    "content": "Commissioner Summer Mersinger, of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is one of the few U.S. regulators who is routinely willing to defend the crypto industry and call out what she sees as overzealous oversight. She will be speaking at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas, on May 30.\n\nCoinDesk caught up with Mersinger to discuss the Cain and Abel rivalry between the CFTC and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), how her agency decides which enforcement actions to pursue and her views on a variety of issues, including the CME possibly getting into the spot bitcoin market, the emerging world of betting markets and Washington D.C. traffic.\n\nIs it an accurate view that the SEC and the CFTC are in somewhat of a turf war over crypto?\n\nI think there are certainly questions around who has the appropriate authority. There are people between the two agencies who are willing to work together, in fact, at Consensus Commissioner Peirce and I will be speaking together. We have some similar views. But it is a struggle because, sometimes where debate has been leveled – whether it\u0027s an enforcement case or another action we have said falls under our fraud and manipulation enforcement authority – we\u0027re seeing the SEC start to ask questions as though it falls under their jurisdiction. And so there is certainly some tension there. It’s largely the lack of clarity that\u0027s really causing the tension.\n\nYou\u0027re in a minority position as a regulator who’s somewhat favorable to crypto. Could you just explain why it is that you\u0027re willing to stick your neck out?\n\nPart of the reason I went into government, generally, is that – while there\u0027s a need for government in people\u0027s lives – we don\u0027t want to overstep. We also want to make sure the rules of the road are clear so that people can abide by the law. This is an area where there is a real problem. A lot of people are very interested in investing in, or trading, cryptocurrencies, and we have not provided any clarity – we\u0027ve made it very murky. That\u0027s not what the government should be doing. It’s creating a situation where you have people relying on the word of a regulator, and the rules of the game are being changed in the middle of the play.\n\nI still think it\u0027s important that we speak up and let people know that, whether you like crypto or not, that\u0027s not the point here. The point is that regulators have really made this confusing and difficult.\n\nDo you agree with Commissioner Pham’s idea that the Government Accountability Office should investigate the CFTC\u0027s enforcement actions?\n\nCOMMISSIONER MERSINGER: It’s difficult to ask another agency to come in and look at the internal workings of the CFTC. I understand where Commissioner Pham is coming from and I think it\u0027s that same kind of feeling that we shouldn\u0027t be regulating through enforcement. But I also think this is a leadership question. I greatly respect Chairman Behnam, but this is an issue with the political direction from this White House. So, instead of an audit, we need to ask: Is the problem the agency, or the current political leadership driving our agenda and broadly stifling financial innovation?\n\nI don\u0027t want to put words in your mouth, but is this to suggest that the regulatory landscape would improve if Trump was re-elected in November?\n\nThere are clear differences between President Biden and former President Trump, so that does drive the regulatory agenda. So, if leadership changes, you would certainly assume there would be new policies and a new regulatory agenda.\n\nI\u0027m curious to what extent you\u0027re in active dialogue with Congressmembers about potential crypto legislation?\n\nThey use us as a resource. We talk to members of the House Financial Services Committee, the Agriculture Committee, and certainly members of the Senate and work with them on where there is ambiguity in the laws or opportunities to make some delineations and clear paths for regulation. It’s offering our assistance and expertise and it’s helpful to have those conversations because they also want to make sure we\u0027re able to implement the laws that they pass. They may have great intentions, but if it\u0027s impossible for the agency to implement then it’s useless.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. Do you think that there needs to be bespoke crypto legislation or would new interpretations of existing laws suffice?\n\nThere are some who believe we can use current statutory authority, whether the SEC or the CFTC, to regulate – which is where we see regulation through enforcement actions. I disagree. The only way to get past just bringing enforcement actions is to have something come out of Congress that says “here\u0027s how to handle cryptocurrencies.”\n\nSee also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)\n\nBeyond legislation, the two agencies also need to sit down and come up with some joint rulemaking. We did that with Dodd Frank, and we certainly could do that here. That’s an important piece of making sure people know which regulator is going to regulate them, which door to walk into. There\u0027s no question that without statutory changes to ensure it\u0027s very clear where the jurisdiction is, agencies will try to go in separate directions.\n\nI know every enforcement action is primarily driven by facts on the ground. But I think it might be interesting to get a view into how these cases are built. What is the process of building a case against someone like Avi Eisenberg?\n\nWithout talking about any specific enforcement cases, with a lot of these cases it\u0027s been whistleblower reports saying “I think somebody is violating the law.” It could be a victim who says they lost money, and I don\u0027t think what they\u0027re doing is legal. We have a pretty large team of enforcement investigators and attorneys who start building a case. By the time it gets to us at the commission, usually the facts have been pretty well established and how they line up with the law. We\u0027re kind of like a jury that decides whether the facts meet our statutory requirements.\n\nA lot of it is done by the enforcement team that might interview the whistleblower and other employees, get documents. A lot of time goes into each case before it gets to the commission for a vote. There\u0027s also a lot of cooperation between the various agencies, whether it\u0027s the DOJ, state regulators or the SEC. So where there\u0027s opportunities to bring cases under multiple statutes, or different regulators, they\u0027ll work together. It\u0027s more efficient for the government if they can work together. They can also tip each other off. If we had to get every lead, I think it\u0027d be really difficult.\n\nNow one distinction I want to make is you hear a lot of numbers around crypto enforcement cases. I think it\u0027s a little unfair because a lot of these cases are just run of the mill fraud; somebody stealing someone else\u0027s money, someone claiming to buy crypto, but not actually buying the crypto. So we\u0027ve seen this play out with whatever the hot topic is at the time. I\u0027d say every few years the theme changes – it was foreign currencies, it was metals, we saw a lot of gold fraud. Right now crypto is the hot thing. A lot of cases have been portrayed as cryptocurrency fraud, but it\u0027s just fraud with a crypto wrapper around it. So tomorrow, it might be AI fraud.\n\nI almost hate to say it, but given how much fraud centers around crypto, do you think that there should be more enforcement actions?\n\nI think when it\u0027s straight up fraud, yes. There\u0027s a distinction here when you have a case where somebody just takes your money and claims to invest in something and never does – there\u0027s no question who has the authority there. The more we can try to shut some of this down, the better.\n\nBut where there\u0027s a policy question around a certain activity and how our statute would fit with that activity, that\u0027s where I get a little nervous. For instance, if we\u0027re looking at a DeFi protocol, and we\u0027re saying they\u0027re violating our statute it can be difficult if we\u0027ve never really said how our statute applies to DeFi.\n\nWe’re starting to set out definitions and interpretations based on court cases, because sometimes you\u0027ll find use cases where there are bad actors. Sometimes it\u0027s people who want to abide by the law, but there\u0027s no clear way how they would do that. That\u0027s why I think we\u0027d be better off with rulemaking.\n\nWhat do you make of the argument that the SEC implicitly said that Ethereum is a commodity when futures went live in 2021?\n\nSo this is an interesting question in development. We do have futures products trading on ether. And I do think if somebody decides that ether is a security, it calls into question what happens. We\u0027ve [the CFTC] been regulating those contracts. They operated well, we have no concerns. This was an area where we thought there was clarity, and now we\u0027re not quite sure if there\u0027s clarity and that\u0027s dangerous.\n\nThe law is a little strange; commodities can be a lot of other things – you can have a commodity that is a security. The nomenclature gets a little tricky the way the law is written. But we\u0027ve said we believe this is a commodity and we\u0027re going to regulate it as such under CFTC jurisdiction because it is a derivative product. To me that has been clearly laid out and we shouldn\u0027t be introducing new kinds of questions around what has been a clear policy.\n\nGiven how interrelated these assets are, do you think the U.S. would be better off with a single unified agency, like the U.K.’s FCA?\n\nI\u0027m always hesitant to recommend any new government agencies or adding more government. History has shown that more government has never been the answer. But I do think sometimes you\u0027ve got to better tailor statutes. Crypto doesn\u0027t neatly fit into any of our financial categories, so we\u0027re gonna have to fine tune some of the law. That\u0027s what Congress does, so we can easily do this without any new agency.\n\nWhy is the CFTC so against betting markets?\n\nIt\u0027s a very tough, difficult topic because there\u0027s a lot of nuance. So these markets, which we call event contracts, are part of our statute that was added under the Dodd Frank Act. In the grand scheme of things, it\u0027s relatively new, but we\u0027ve seen interest in these contracts for quite some time and it\u0027s certainly ramping up. The way Congress laid it out for us it said these contracts generally are OK, as long as they don\u0027t touch on a number of topics, like gaming, war, terrorism, assassination – anything that\u0027s against federal law. There are a number of people who really don\u0027t like election contracts and would like to include them in this list.\n\nThen there\u0027s this public interest piece that tries to determine whether having this contract would be against the public interest. It\u0027s not necessarily that we are against these markets, but there have to be some guardrails. Congress directed us to have some guardrails, and we’re trying to build them. You see that with our recent vote. My feeling is if that\u0027s the route you want to take, you still have to do a public interest determination for every contract, which is why I dissented because we were limiting elections as a category.\n\nSee also: \u0027What Are We Waiting for\u0027? SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce on Crypto Regulation\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to create a framework where if you\u0027re registered with us, you won’t have a legal question every time you try to do something new. We are just struggling a little bit with the approach. Congress tried to help us create clarity, but certainly left a lot of a lot left to the regulator to figure out.\n\nThe Financial Times reported today that CME is thinking about listing spot bitcoin trading, not not just bitcoin futures. Is that something that you are supportive of?\n\nYou know, the first time I heard about it was this morning as well, so I haven\u0027t had those conversations. I want to talk a little bit more with CME and with our staff to find out what this means. There\u0027s a lot of questions around custody and other issues. So right now, I don\u0027t have a positive or negative opinion and honestly, as a regulator, I shouldn\u0027t. They should be able to make those market decisions as long as they\u0027re following the rules. We try to be a regulator that is principles based and let our registered entities run the markets, because that\u0027s what they do. Our job is just to make sure everyone\u0027s following the rules.\n\nQuick round of overrated/underrated? You could decline to answer or clarify your position. DeFi?\n\nI don\u0027t have a position one way or the other. I just think as a regulator, we should have clear rules of the road for DeFi.\n\nWashington D.C.?\n\nYou know, I\u0027m gonna say Washington D.C. is a little overrated. Mostly because I was just in the Midwest where there was no traffic. It was very pleasant.\n\nGary Gensler?\n\nNeutral. You know, I\u0027ve never met him. So I try to withhold my opinions of people until I\u0027ve had a chance to sit down and get to know them.\n\nThe phrase “sufficiently decentralized?”\n\nYou\u0027re either decentralized or you\u0027re not. So I think sufficiently decentralized feels a little overrated because I don\u0027t know what that means. It probably means you\u0027re not decentralized.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to at Consensus?\n\nThe conversations with so many different stakeholders. This is an opportunity to talk with people we ordinarily wouldn’t see in Washington, D.C. and to have them all in one place is really special.\n\nThank you again for the time. Nice to meet you both.\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you.\n\n",

    "summary": "Traders will not want to be short ETH while going through an ETF approval, one observer said.\n\nRenewed hopes of an ether ETF debut in the U.S. is likely to see investors take money out of SOL and other alternative cryptocurrencies to invest into ETH.\n\nApproval of a spot ether ETF is likely to broaden mainstream demand for crypto in the long run.\n\n",
    "content": "The crypto bull run that began last October has been characterized by Ethereum\u0027s ether (ETH) token underperforming rival layer 1 coins such as SOL, BNB and market leader bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThat, however, could change in the coming weeks, with ether overtaking the others on renewed hopes that a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be approved in the U.S., opening the doors to a deluge of institutional money.\n\nLate Monday, CoinDesk reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked firms looking to list and trade ether ETFs to update and refile documents necessary to secure regulatory approval. Around the same time, Bloomberg\u0027s ETF analysts raised the probability of the approval to 75% from 25%.\n\n\"ETH has been a de-facto funding token of this bull cycle, similar to the low-yielding Japanese yen in the currency market. With renewed hopes of a spot ETH ETF, traders would want to square off their ETH shorts vs SOL and other tokens,\" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an interview. \"The unwinding of shorts will happen over time, ensuring ether outperformance in the near-term.\"\n\nThough approval is not guaranteed , the signs of progress contrast starkly with the pessimism early this year that saw investors prefer BTC, SOL and others over the ether.\n\nNearly a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S. mid-January, putting the leading cryptocurrency at the forefront of mainstream institutional adoption. Furthermore, in the first quarter, investors increasingly flocked to cheaper and faster programmable blockchains like Solana, strengthening the bullish case for their native tokens.\n\nThat meant investors had an incentive to sell ether and buy SOL, BTC and other coins much as in forex markets investors sold the yen in favor of relatively high-yielding currencies like the dollar, euro and British pound. The SOL-ETH ratio has risen by 287% since October, and the ETH-BTC ratio has declined by 16.6%, according to TradingView.\n\nThat\u0027s no longer the case. The potential introduction of an ether ETF would put the cryptocurrency in a completely different category from SOL and other tokens. As such, the ETF speculation could see investors rotate money out of alternative cryptocurrencies and into ether. The token has rallied more than SOL, BTC and others in the past 24 hours.\n\n\"This ETH move might be just getting started,\" Solot said. \"There could be waves of short covering as nobody would want to be short ETH going through an ETF approval.\"\n\nDerivatives market activity suggests investors are yet to price in ether leadership over the long term.\n\n\"The derivatives market believes that the current jump in ether is more likely caused by speculative sentiment. The front end of the ETH/BTC forward exchange rate term structure has seen some contango, but the back end remains in backwardation. This implies that investors have not changed their views on the long-term performance of ETH compared to BTC,\" said Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin, in a Telegram chat.\n\nThat\u0027s consistent with analysts\u0027 view that ether ETFs will not hurt demand for bitcoin ETFs over the long run.\n\n\"I don\u0027t see spot ETH ETFs draining funds from BTC ETFs,\" Noelle Acheson, author of the popular Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, told CoinDesk. \"There may be some churn, but approval of the spot ETH ETFs is more likely to broaden the mainstream demand rather than channel it, with many investors seeing the ETH ETFs as a diversifier of the crypto portion of portfolios.\"\n\nAcheson added that the jump in overall crypto interest should continue to boost both, especially as investors become familiar with the different narratives and likely use cases.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "By approving bitcoin as an underlying product within the ETF space, the SEC has reduced risk at the base level of the asset, BitGo\u0027s Steve Scott writes. The only question is now will they invest?\n\n",
    "content": "As anticipated, the rollout of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. market has made a massive positive impact on the digital asset industry. It’s unleashed a stampede of retail investors, and set records for investment into bitcoin (BTC) and into ETFs.\n\nMore importantly, being in a product approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has changed the risk reward ratio for bitcoin, bringing crypto back into the institutional investment conversation. That’s driving new interest from some firms and emboldening others to restart projects that had been put on pause. The door into the mainstream financial system has been reopened.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nInstitutional investors think about risk in many dimensions, with some being: products, counterparties and the risks around the underlying asset itself. In traditional finance (TradFi), all of these are well understood.\n\nThe products have become commoditized, with many firms offering similar products. The counterparties – the market makers, custodians, clearinghouses, etc. that help absorb trading risk are well known. The different asset classes are also well understood and there are time honored ways of evaluating the risks of a particular asset.\n\nOver many years a lot of the risk and volatility has been taken out of the system. It’s black swan type events that create problems. The risk is low but so are the rewards. Opportunities to beat the market are hard to find.\n\nWhat we’ve seen in crypto is a series of events that have had a negative impact, but are foreseeable given the industry’s lack of regulation and controls. The risk of these events happening has been too high for institutions to go after the outsized rewards.\n\nThe bitcoin ETFs reduce risk across all three dimensions.\n\nETFs have been available in the U.S. market for over 30 years. Everyone understands the product. Buying the asset in a securitized product is more straightforward than buying spot bitcoin outright. Many investors feel it’s a better path to pay a management fee to have someone else handle custody, settlement risk, and other operational aspects of trading Bitcoin. They no longer have to take those risks directly.\n\nThe presence of big brand names like BlackRock, Fidelity and others reduces counterparty risk. There are plenty of crypto native custodians, liquidity providers and market makers, but they are relatively unknown in the world of TradFi.\n\nSee also: Bitcoin ETFs Also Owned by Steven Cohen\u0027s Point72\n\nThe ETFs introduce some of the reliant counterparties within the crypto universe to general investors. Knowing that big TradFi players have done the due diligence on their financials, processes and procedures and security practices reduces the fear factor. Not only that, it shows them who they could go to for help if they wanted to hold bitcoin and other digital assets and do spot trading themselves in the future.\n\nBy approving bitcoin as an underlying product within the ETF space, the SEC has reduced risk at the base level of the asset – namely, the fear that crypto could be entirely banned in the U.S., obviously greater regulatory clarity could reduce asset risk further, but market demand for ETFs has pushed the agency to settle some important questions. It has also pushed ETF issuers to put in place many of the plain vanilla elements that reduce risk that institutional players expect to see.\n\nAll of these elements create trust in the market, which is crucial for resuming digital assets’ journey into the mainstream. There’s a lot of ideology, jargon and technical terms surrounding crypto. But essentially it\u0027s just another asset class that uses a different technology.\n\nPrior to FTX, a lot of people put those risks aside and focus on price appreciation and gaining access to the market. Post FTX, people are saying, I want to be involved, but I need to know I\u0027m protected at a basic level. The ETFs do that, while exposing institutional investors to the reliant counterparties in crypto. They’ve put the industry back on a positive track.\n\nSee also: Bitcoin ETF Holdings Disclosed by Morgan Stanley\n\nThere are two things keeping institutions away from digital assets right now. One is philosophical. They don’t believe in or like Bitcoin or crypto. Then there is a second camp for whom the risk/reward ratio still isn’t attractive enough. For these people, the success of the ETFs is making it increasingly difficult to sit on the sidelines, especially when clients are asking for crypto products.\n\nThe day will come where the main risk with Bitcoin and other digital assets is at the base level of asset performance – just as it is in TradFi. It isn’t going to be one ruling or one product that magically makes it happen. It’s going to be a long process, but eventually all the questions about products and counterparties and regulations will fade away.\n\nThe only question will be, do you want to invest in digital assets, or not?\n\n",

    "summary": "Following the SEC charges against the world’s largest crypto exchange, people are wondering what’s the difference between Binance and Binance.us, who is Changpeng Zhao and more.\n\n",
    "content": "Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who is often referred to as just “CZ,” Binance is the world\u0027s leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of June 2023. The company was originally based in China but had to leave Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions shortly after its launch.\n\nBinance developed its own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (later renamed to BNB Chain), which facilitates trades on the exchange. The native token of the blockchain is Binance coin (BNB) and the company has also launched a stablecoin, BinanceUSD (BUSD). Because of U.S. regulatory rules, Binance created a supposedly separate company for its U.S. clients in 2019, Binance.US.\n\nOn June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US as well as CZ, who serves as Binance CEO, on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering BNB and BUSD to the general public, calling them unregistered securities. The SEC lawsuit also casts fresh doubt on the independence of the company’s U.S. arm and its staking service.\n\nRead more about the SEC suit here\n\nThis is not Binance’s first battle with U.S. regulators. Binance is also under ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who sued CZ and Binance in March 2023, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao.\n\nCZ is a well-known personality in crypto, actively engaging with the crypto community through Twitter and speaking at conferences and to the media. As for his origins, he was born in China and emigrated to Canada when he was 12 and says he is a Canadian citizen. In high school, he worked part-time at McDonald’s, which is part of his well-known lore. He graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science.\n\nAfter college, he worked for the Tokyo stock exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook developing software for the businesses. He then founded a startup in 2005, Fusion Systems, which focused on creating an automated high-frequency trading platform. Following that, he worked for several crypto startups including a stint as co-founder and CTO of OKCoin. Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.\n\nAccording to the white paper, Zhao\u0027s goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support.\n\nShortly after Binance’s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper.\n\nBinance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China’s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance’s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based.\n\nBinance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance\u0027s proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange.\n\nBinance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance’s services.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange.\n\nThe other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees.\n\nFinally, unlike Binance’s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange.\n\nJuly 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO.\n\nJuly 2018: Binance acquires Trust Wallet, a free, non-custodial mobile wallet to support its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) offering.\n\nJanuary 2019: Binance starts to offer support for new token listings through ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings), through its Launchpad product.\n\nApril 2019: Binance migrates BNB from Ethereum to its proprietary chain, then called Binance Smart Chain (now rebranded to Binance chain or BNB chain)\n\nApril 2019: Binance launches its DEX ahead of schedule.\n\nMay 2019: Binance gets hacked for the first time. Hackers steal over 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) from Binance (the equivalent of roughly $41 million at the time). Zhao quickly took to social media to reassure users that no one lost funds and that Binance used its reserve funds to cover the costs of the stolen crypto. CZ\u0027s \"Funds are #SAFU\" tweet has become a meme in the crypto space.\n\nJune 2019: Binance announces it will launch a new trading platform for U.S. customers, in partnership with a firm called BAM Trading Services.\n\nJuly 2019: Binance hires former Ripple executive, Catherine Coley, to run its planned U.S. marketplace.\n\nSeptember 2019: Binance launches its own dollar-backed stablecoin, BUSD in partnership with the Paxos Trust Company.\n\nSeptember 2019: Binance.US launches in 37 states. The new marketplace supports six cryptocurrencies at launch: bitcoin, (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and BNB. BUSD is notably not supported at launch.\n\nApril 2020: Binance buys CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data provider, for a rumored $400 million, making it one of the biggest M\u0026A deals in crypto. “CoinMarketCap has more users than any other product in the crypto space,” Zhao said at the time. “It’s a very valuable platform.”\n\nSeptember 2020: Binance rolls out Launchpool, a crypto staking platform.\n\nNovember 2020: Binance notifies U.S. customers they have a hard deadline of two weeks to migrate to the new platform before Binance shutters their accounts.\n\nApril 2021: Binance.US hires Brian Brooks as CEO to replace Catherine Coley in the role.\n\nAugust 2021: Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks quits over “strategic differences” after just months in the job.\n\nSeptember 2021: Binance.US promotes Brian Schroder to CEO; he formerly served as president and board member for the firm.\n\nApril 2022: Binance.US raises $200 million in its first funding round, giving it a $4.5 billion valuation.\n\nSeptember 2022: Binance announces it will stop supporting the second-largest stablecoin USDC and automatically convert customer funds to BUSD.\n\nOctober 2022: Binance suffers another major hack, and had to briefly halt trading on BNB after a “potential exploit” drained $100 million in crypto.\n\nOctober 2022: Binance confirms it has contributed $500 million towards Elon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter.\n\nNovember 2022: Amidst the collapse of FTX, there was a brief moment when Binance was going to buy the rival exchange. That deal quickly collapsed as the scope of FTX’s issues came to light.\n\nDecember 2022: Binance.US reaches an agreement to buy Voyager Digital\u0027s assets for just over $1 billion. Voyager, had gone into bankruptcy earlier in 2022 and originally had agreed to sell its assets to FTX, which folded itself.\n\nFebruary 2023: BUSD issuer Paxos is hit with a one-two punch of an investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice from the SEC, which some believed hinted at Binance as a future target for the SEC. Following these actions, Paxos halted minting BUSD.\n\nMarch 2023: The CFTC sues CZ and Binance over allegations that the company offered unregistered crypto derivatives products.\n\nApril 2023: Rumors of an Interpol “Red Notice” for CZ tank BNB price, but there is little to back up the claim.\n\nApril 2023: Binance.US pulls out of a $1 billion deal to buy Voyager Digital’s assets, attributing the termination to the \"hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.\"\n\nJune 2023: The SEC files charges against Binance.US and its founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws with BNB token and Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin. The suit also alleges that Binance\u0027s staking service violated securities law as well as that the entities of Binance.US and Binance were not truly independent.\n\n",
