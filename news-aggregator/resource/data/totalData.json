Death of Bitcoin Wallet Owner The death of a Bitcoin wallet owner also presents a formidable challenge to the world of digital assets. If the Bitcoin wallet owner has not implemented any measures for estate planning to transfer private key information, then their Bitcoin wallet might become completely inaccessible. It creates difficulty for Bitcoin wallet recovery, as highlighted in various examples. Therefore, it is important to include cryptocurrencies in estate planning or choose Dead Man’s switches for crypto. Sending Bitcoin to Wrong Addresses Anyone can send Bitcoins to the wrong address by mistake. Since Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, there is no way to recover the assets from your wallet. Therefore, you should double-check the transaction details before sending Bitcoin. Bitcoin Burn Wallets Bitcoin wallets can be inaccessible when they are used as burn wallets. The primary purpose of burning wallets is to remove coins from circulation. You cannot think of methods to recover Bitcoin wallet passwords for burn wallets as they don’t offer scope for retrieval.

Dormant wallets can indicate the removal of Bitcoin from active circulation, which enhances its scarcity. Bitcoin Theft Bitcoin wallets are not immune to theft.

It is important to remember that Bitcoin wallets are not like your physical wallets, where you can store your bank cards and cash. You must learn about Bitcoin wallet backup restore features only with an in-depth understanding of public and private keys. However, human error can creep in somewhere, and you may end up giving away your private keys or forgetting that you even have a wallet. If you don’t remember where you have stored your Bitcoin wallet, you can look for your wallet data on your computer or storage devices.

Find out the Type of Bitcoin Wallet The first step to recovering your Bitcoin wallet is to know the type of Bitcoin wallet you want to recover.

You must start by identifying the crypto exchange you used to store your Bitcoin. Custodial wallets on crypto exchanges allow users to access their wallets through traditional methods, such as email addresses and passwords.

You have to find the seed phrase on physical belongings, as it is the best chance at restoring your software wallet. If you don’t have the private keys or the seed phrase, then you can choose recovery tools to find the ‘wallet.dat’ file. For example, Puran File Recovery is a popular tool for retrieving lost or deleted files and partitions. Recuva is also one of the popular choices for recovering deleted files from USB sticks, hard drives, and memory cards. Mac users can opt for TestDisk to recover lost partitions. However, these tools do not offer the assurance of recovering all your files and partitions. Restore Your Bitcoin Hardware Wallet You can restore Bitcoin wallet in the case of hardware wallets with the help of your PIN code. However, you would have only three attempts to enter the PIN code. Wrong attempts can cause the device to restart, and you can bid goodbye to your wallet forever. Therefore, use the PIN code method only if you remember it. Without the PIN code, you can use the seed phrase of the wallet. Most of the hardware wallet devices offer a card to write down your seed phrase. You should try looking for that card or any copies that you might have made. Look for it everywhere before you are sure that you have lost it. The last resort to recover your Bitcoin hardware wallet involves physically hacking into the wallet. At the same time, it is also important to remember that top hardware wallet devices offer advanced security features, making them completely immune to physical hacking.

Let us find out how decentralized exchanges solve the problems found in centralized exchanges and a list of popular decentralized exchanges you should try in 2024. Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains’ Blockchain Certifications designed to provide enhanced career prospects. How Does a Decentralized Exchange Work? You can compare the different entries in a list of decentralized exchanges with an enhanced understanding of their working mechanism. Decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, are peer-to-peer marketplaces that remove the single points of failure evident in centralization. As a result, they help take away most of the risks associated with centralized exchanges. Aren’t they meant to be the perfect solutions to problems with centralized exchanges? Do DEXs address only the risk of single points of failure? The first generation of DEXs aimed at replicating the user experience of centralized exchanges and used order books. However, such types of decentralized exchanges presented difficulties in usability and were expensive and inefficient. The reputation of decentralized exchanges improved when Automated Market Makers or AMMs were introduced in DEX design. Most of the top decentralized exchanges use AMMs, which are smart contracts that can automatically set the price of crypto assets on the basis of supply and demand. The new decentralized exchanges could allow anyone to swap tokens in a trustless environment and lock their tokens in liquidity pools. AMM smart contracts are responsible for establishing the exchange rate and the rewards for liquidity providers. At the same time, AMMs also offer an intuitive user experience in decentralized exchanges. 1Inch The first entry among the most notable DEXs is 1Inch, which offers the advantage of combining the best features of different DEXs. 1Inch helps you avoid confusion with queries like “Which is the best-decentralized exchange?” as it is a DEX aggregator.

It is an alphanumeric string that helps in receiving digital currency in the crypto wallet. The public key does not include any sensitive information and is visible to everyone on the blockchain. No one can use the public key of your wallet to compromise its security. The important component responsible for cryptocurrency security issues is the private key. You can think of it as the password to your crypto wallet. The private key is an automatically generated and lengthy string of characters. You must always maintain privacy of your private key, as anyone can access your wallet and the assets in it with the private key.

    "content": "Crypto analyst TechDev has provided insights into the Bitcoin (BTC) future trajectory. The analyst hinted that the flagship crypto was currently mirroring its price action in 2017 and could soon make a parabolic rise like it did back then. History Could Repeat Itself TechDev shared a chart on his X (formerly Twitter) platform with the caption, “The more things change, the more they stay the same.” The chart showed that Bitcoin’s current price action was mirroring that of the 2017 bull run when it recorded a price gain of 1,200% on its way to a previous high of $20,000. Related Reading This Crypto Trader Just Sold All His Bitcoin For Altcoins Like Cardano And XRP, Here’s Why 3 days ago Source: X Interestingly, just like in 2017, when Bitcoin’s price bottomed following the Bitfinex crash, the crypto token also looked to have bottomed in this market cycle when FTX, another crypto exchange, collapsed. Back then, Bitcoin consolidated for some time before enjoying a parabolic rally, which made it reach $20,000 in 2018. As TechDev suggested, history could repeat itself with Bitcoin consolidating ahead of a move that could send it to as high as $100,000. From the chart the crypto analyst shared, one could see that Bitcoin has consolidated longer in this market cycle than it did in 2017. However, crypto analyst Rekt Capital hinted that this longer period of consolidation was necessary. He mentioned that Bitcoin was accelerating by almost 200 days in this market cycle and added that consolidating for longer will help it resynchronize with previous bull cycles. This strategic consolidation is a reassuring sign of Bitcoin’s stability and potential for growth. Meanwhile, in a recent X post, he revealed that Bitcoin was already attempting to perform the “post Bull Flag breakout retest,” which could secure a trend continuation to the upside. Source: X In a subsequent X post, Rekt Capital shared a chart showing that a breakout from the $66,000 range could kickstart the continuation of Bitcoin’s bull run, which could well send its price above $100,000. “Optimal Targets” For Bitcoin In This Market Cycle Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto mentioned in an X post that the optimal targets for Bitcoin in this bull run should be between $138,000 and $150,000. Interestingly, he made this statement while revealing that the crypto’s current price action is mirroring that of 2017. The crypto analyst’s prediction suggests that Bitcoin enjoying a 1,200% price gain (like in 2017) is unlikely. Related Reading Cardano Whales Return To The Table, Increase Massive Holdings By 10% 4 days ago However, it is worth noting that other crypto analysts like PlanB have offered more bullish predictions for Bitcoin, which indicates that the flagship crypto could still see a 10x increase from its current price level. Specifically, PlanB predicted that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $1 million in 2025, which would be the market top for the crypto token. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,000, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

    "content": "An analyst has explained how the current Bitcoin surge appears to have hit the halfway completion mark if this indicator is to go by. Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator Suggests BTC Rally Only Halfway Done In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has posted an update for how the Bitcoin Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator is looking like after the latest rally. The VWAP is an indicator that, as its full form suggests, calculates an average price for the cryptocurrency based on not just the changes in the price over the day but also the volume that was traded at these prices. Related Reading Litecoin Whales Go On $230 Million Buying Spree: Will This Change LTC’s Stars? 1 day ago Normally, this volume is measured using the spot volume data provided by centralized exchanges. Still, in the case of Bitcoin, the blockchain is available for anyone to explore, so on-chain volume is used to calculate the VWAP instead. The VWAP Oscillator, which is the actual metric of interest here, takes the ratio between the cryptocurrency’s spot price and the VWAP and represents it as an oscillator around zero. Earlier in the month, Woo had pointed out how the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator was forming a bullish divergence for the asset. How the VWAP Oscillator looked like earlier in the month | Source: @woonomic on X As is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator climbed up inside the negative territory after forming an apparent bottom back then. At the same time, the cryptocurrency’s price had been heading down instead. In the past, such a setup has proven to be bullish for the coin, and the resulting bullish momentum usually lasts until the VWAP Oscillator tops out in positive territory. As such, the analyst remarked that the coin had a lot of room to run back then. Since then, the price has experienced a recovery rally, potentially suggesting that the bullish divergence may be paying off. As Woo pointed out, the indicator has returned to the neutral mark after this run. It looks like the value of the metric is making a break into the positive territory | Source: @woonomic on X Based on the fact that tops in the past have occurred after the metric peaks in the positive territory and based on the scale of these peaks usually, the analyst concludes, “this Bitcoin move is now at the halfway mark.” Related Reading Bulls In Control: Ethereum Longs See Biggest Candle Ever After ETF News 1 day ago As for how things could play out next, the analyst says, Consolidation under all-time-high needs to happen for a little, then we see if the second leg gives us escape velocity to new highs which will open up the flood gates. Woo has also shared a “risk signal” for Bitcoin, which shows where the asset is when looking at the bigger picture. The data for the BTC risk signal over the last few years | Source: @woonomic on X BTC may be in that part of the cycle where risk begins to drive up as price reacts violently to capital inflows. “That’s where most of the fast gains happen,” notes the analyst.

    "content": "The wider crypto market has seen a significant uptick in recent weeks, with some contenders gaining major momentum. The most bullish area is the meme coin sector, which continues to grow and expand, offering the best opportunity to earn profits during the anticipated bull run. As the crypto community prepares for it and looks for attractive investment opportunities, numerous industry experts are pointing towards these five tokens, believing they could explode in the weeks ahead. Let’s take a closer look at these hidden altcoin gems. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet the Best Presale Coin Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Best Five Tokens for Profitable Investments in 2024 – Quick Outline Here’s a quick outline of the tokens we’ll be analyzing: Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) — Pioneering Multi-Chain Token Surpasses $15M Milestone in Just Over a Month Sealana ($SEAL) — Set to Transform the Traditional American Dream Right from Its Mother’s Basement WienerAI ($WAI) — Draws Significant Attention by Combining AI and Meme Coin Culture and Offering Major APYs Sponge V2 ($SPONGE) — Boosts Investment Potential with New Features Including an Engaging Play-to-Earn Game Bonk (BONK) — Leading Solana Token Gaining Traction Before the Bull Run \u003e\u003e\u003eGet the Best Presale Coin Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Best Five Tokens for Profitable Investments in 2024 – Detailed Analysis Now, let’s examine each one to discover what makes them stand out in the market. Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) — Pioneering Multi-Chain Token Surpasses $15M Milestone in Just Over a Month Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), an innovative meme coin, operates on a multi-chain framework that includes Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Solana, Base, and Avalanche. This architecture improves efficiency, reduces transaction fees, and greatly improves the user experience. The Dogeverse presale has garnered significant attention, raising over $15 million from early investors in just over a month. There are still opportunities to invest, with 15% of the tokens designated for the presale, 10% reserved for staking rewards, and 25% allocated for future projects. Following the presale, 5% of the tokens will be used for exchange listings, with 10% each allocated for liquidity and operational support. Dogeverse plans to list on major platforms such as CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap and offers staking options with APYs around 53%. Currently, $DOGEVERSE tokens are priced at $0.0003 each, but this rate is anticipated to soar right after the listing. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Dogeverse Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sealana ($SEAL) — Set to Transform the Traditional American Dream Right from Its Mother’s Basement Sealana ($SEAL) is a Solana-based meme coin featuring a seal character similar to the Gamer Guy from “South Park.” The presale has quickly gained traction, collecting over $2.2 million despite minimal social media presence, reflecting strong investor confidence in $SEAL. Investors can buy Sealana through a widget on the project’s website or by sending SOL to a designated wallet, enabling direct participation in the presale and the potential for profits post-listing. During the presale, contributors receive 6,900 $SEAL tokens per SOL, following a model similar to Slothana, which raised $15 million in a short time. With the hype around it growing, the crypto community is watching $SEAL closely, anticipating it will outperform the success of previous projects on the Solana blockchain. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sealana Now\u003c\u003c\u003c WienerAI ($WAI) — Draws Significant Attention by Combining AI and Meme Coin Culture and Offering Major APYs WienerAI ($WAI) is an innovative AI-driven meme coin, created as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. This unique mix of AI technology and memes appeals to investors by securing transaction precision and security. WienerAI aims to reduce the usual fluctuations of meme coins by offering a staking mechanism with an APY of approximately 400%, promoting long-term holding and massive rewards. To date, over 2.6 billion tokens have been staked. Currently priced at $0.0007, the presale has already raised over $2.5 million. Of the total 69 billion tokens, 30% are allocated for the presale, 20% for staking and community rewards, and 30% for future exchange listings and marketing efforts. As the presale progresses, investors are suggested to participate early to benefit from the favorable price and high APYs. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy WienerAI Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sponge V2 ($SPONGE) — Boosts Investment Potential with New Features Including an Engaging Play-to-Earn Game SPONGE V2 ($SPONGE) is the latest upgrade of the popular $SPONGE meme crypto token, which previously achieved a $100 million market cap and provided significant returns to early investors. A notable enhancement in $SPONGE V2 is a Play-to-Earn game inspired by SpongeBob SquarePants. Given the impressive growth of the original $SPONGE token, investors are optimistic about the potential success of Sponge V2 in the meme coin market. To promote long-term investment, the project features a scheme where holders who lock their original Sponge V1 tokens for an extended period can earn impressive staking rewards in $SPONGE V2 tokens over four years. This strategy is designed to boost early adoption and maintain engagement. As the presale nears its conclusion, investors are suggested to secure the remaining tokens before the listing. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sponge V2 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Bonk (BONK) — Leading Solana Token Gaining Traction Before the Bull Run Bonk (BONK) was introduced on the Solana network on Christmas 2023, inspired by the Shiba Inu dog. Leveraging the Solana blockchain, Bonk provides faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to Ethereum, which hosts many other meme coins. Although currently a meme coin, there are rumors that Bonk might venture into the DeFi and NFT sectors in the future, indicating potential growth beyond its present status. With a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens, Bonk’s scarcity could potentially impact its price dynamics. Over the past month, BONK has surged by 55.5%, and over the year, it has seen an astonishing increase of 7743%, making it a noteworthy investment opportunity. Given the ongoing growth and appeal of the Solana ecosystem, Bonk could stand out in the anticipated bull run, attracting investors globally. Final Thoughts As the wider crypto market has experienced a surge in recent weeks, it’s obvious that the meme coins sector leads the way. Now, with the anticipated bull run on the horizon, investors are on the lookout for the next exploding tokens to add to their portfolios. Many industry experts suggest these five tokens, believing they could outperform major players in profits in the following weeks. The great news is, you can still acquire them at affordable prices since most of them are still in the ICO stage.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Crypto analyst Dark Defender makes a compelling case for a potential significant rise in the price of XRP.\n\n",
    "content": "In a recent analysis provided by the crypto analyst Dark Defender, a compelling case has been made for the potential significant rise in the price of XRP. Through a detailed examination of the XRP/USD chart on a monthly time frame, as sourced from Binance, Dark Defender highlights a large bullish formation, which he describes as a “bull flag” across multiple longer-term time frames including monthly, three-month, and six-month charts. XRP Price Gears Up For Explosive Move The analysis shows a substantial initial upsurge in price marked by a green arrow, suggesting a strong bullish momentum that started around early 2017 and peaked later that year. The price action following this peak is what Dark Defender identifies as a bull flag pattern. This pattern is characterized by a period of consolidation following a sharp movement in price, resembling a flag on a pole. XRP price analysis | Source: X @DefendDark The consolidation, traced with a red descending trend line and a blue ascending trend line, forms a converging pattern known as a triangle, which typically suggests that the period of consolidation is nearing an end as the lines converge. According to Dark Defender, this suggests a breakout is imminent. Related Reading XRP \u0026 Cardano Whales Load Up Bags: Preparation For Altcoin Rally? 5 days ago “I have read some posts that XRP had a bull flag in the daily time frame, etc. If those are correction bull flags, this is a bull flag, too. But a bullish one. It is in the monthly, three-month, and six-month time frames. If you know a bull flag, you can enjoy your coffee today. Cheers,” he stated. In his forecast, Dark Defender uses the flag pole and Fibonacci extension levels to predict future price points. After the expected breakout above the red resistance line, the first target is situated at the 161.80% Fibonacci level, which would bring XRP to approximately $1.88. A further ambitious target is set at the 261.80% Fibonacci level, priced at about $5.86. The most optimistic target lies at the 361.80% Fibonacci level, forecasting the price to soar as high as approximately $18.23. Notably, Dark Defender’s blue line, analogous in length to the flagpole, shows that the XRP price could rise well above $18. Different Analysis, Similar Price Targets This analysis was further commented on by another renowned XRP community analyst, EGRAG CRYPTO, who brought attention to the fact that the flag portion of the pattern extends beyond half the length of the initial pole, a structural detail that might typically invalidate the bull flag designation. Related Reading Buckle Up, XRP Fans: Analyst Eyes Price Explosion To $0.65 In Next 5 Days 6 days ago “I’ve dabbled in this analysis before, but lately, I’ve become increasingly intrigued by the potential of a symmetrical triangle breakout. What caught my eye is that the Flag is extending beyond half the length of the Pole which invalidates the structure. Regardless of who’s right or wrong, hope to meet in the near future and being multimillionaires. Keep up the fantastic work,” Egrag noted. Despite this technical caveat, EGRAG CRYPTO remains positive about the potential of a symmetrical triangle breakout. In a recent analysis of the weekly chart, EGRAG elaborated that XRP will at least explode towards $1.5 if price breaks out to the upside of the triangle. On a broader triangle pattern, EGRAG expects a move to $5.89. XRP price analysis | Source: X @egragcrypto “XRP Army, STAY STEADY! There’s a mini pump to $1.5 and a major pump to $5.89 in the cards, with the MACRO pump potentially soaring above 2 digits,” he stated. Despite their different approaches, the two analysts are therefore very close in their analyses. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5189.

    "content": "Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency, is currently demonstrating signals that suggest it might be on the cusp of a significant bullish breakout. According to a recent analysis from prominent crypto analyst Ali, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency appears to be approaching a crucial resistance level, with market behaviors hinting at potential upward movement. Related Reading Did A Dogecoin Whale Just Sink The DOGE Ship? The $30-Million Transfer Mystery 5 days ago Eyes Set On Breaking The $0.2 Resistance Level Ali, a well-known market analyst, pointed out that Dogecoin is testing the possibility of reaching its highest price level in over a month at $0.2. His analysis is based on DOGE’s recent escape from a descending triangle pattern, which typically suggests a shift in market dynamics favoring buyers. Following a pattern similar to the previous cycle, where DOGE experienced a retracement after breaking out from a descending pattern before rallying, the asset has recently completed a significant 47% retracement. This movement has led Ali to highlight the market’s tendency to echo past patterns, though not perfectly. With the breakout from the descending pattern and subsequent retracement now complete, DOGE is positioning itself for another push toward the $0.2 resistance level. History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes!! https://t.co/qr9BG5QnjH — Ali (@ali_charts) May 21, 2024 This level has proven challenging, with selling pressure frequently intensifying around this range. However, the broader market sentiment remains bullish, which could support Dogecoin’s push toward this key price point. Notably, to reach $0.2, DOGE would need to increase further by nearly 20% from its current position. Currently, the memecoin is trading at $0.168, reflecting a 10% increase over the past 24 hours and continuing a week-long uptrend that has seen nearly a 15% increase. DOGE price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart. Source: DOGE/USDT on TradingView.com Surging Interest In Dogecoin And Strong Upside Signal The positive movement in DOGE’s price performance is further underscored by a surge in DOGE’s open interest, which has risen by 23% in the past day to reach $1 billion, according to data from Coinglass. DOGE Futures Open Interest (USD).| Source: Coinglass Additionally, the open interest volume has soared by 200%, now at nearly $4 billion. An increase in open interest indicates that new market participants are entering or existing positions are being expanded. This can be a sign of strengthening market activity and a supportive factor for the ongoing price increase. Echoing Ali’s sentiment, another analyst from Crypto Daily Trade Signals identified a symmetrical triangle pattern in DOGE’s price movements, reinforcing the potential for continued upward momentum.

    "content": "Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, the co-founders of the on-chain analytics platform Glassnode, recently suggested that Solana (SOL) could make a significant move to the upside in its Ethereum pair. They alluded to the likelihood of Ethereum rising higher as another reason SOL will likely “soar.” Solana To Make A 90% Move Against Ethereum Happel and Allemann, through their shared X account (@Negentropic), highlighted a “clear Cup and Handle pattern” on the SOLETH chart, which suggests Solana will move 90% from its current price level. They also noted that the SOLETH ratio has been consolidating for some time now and looks ready for such a move to the upside. Related Reading Bitcoin Price Mirrors Historical Pattern That Led To $1,200 Surge, Will History Repeat Itself? 1 day ago Source: X Meanwhile, they also predict SOL will soar because they expect Ethereum “to move much higher.” Therefore, a rally for the second-largest crypto token could also spark a significant move for Solana. Interestingly, this move already looks to be in play, seeing that SOL enjoyed up to a 7% price gain on the back of Ethereum’s price rally in the last 24 hours. Therefore, Solana could rise higher as ETH continues to enjoy an upward trend following reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve the pending Spot Ethereum ETF applications. A 90% move for Solana means the crypto token could come close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $260. Crypto analyst Javon Marks had before now predicted that SOL could make such a move, noting that a price gain of 54% may already be in the pipeline. He further claimed that Solana achieving this price move would open up room for another price rally of 93%, which would send SOL’s price to $453. How High Can SOL Rise In This Bull Run? Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa has predicted that Solana could rise to as high as $500 by year-end, while crypto analyst Hansolar predicts that Solana could hit $600 in this market cycle. Crypto YouTuber Jake Gagain offered a more bullish prediction, stating that Solana will rise to $750, although he predicts that will happen next year. Related Reading Bitcoin Rally Incoming: This Major BTC Metric Just Turned Bullish Once Again 2 days ago Interstingly, Hansolar claimed that SOL could be the new Ethereum in this cycle. ETH is known to have been one of the biggest gainers in the last bull run, with its price more than tripling on its way to its current ATH of $4,891. Ethereum’s run then was thanks to its decentralized finance (DeFi) utility, with many DeFi projects utilizing the network. Asset manager Franklin Templeton suggested that Solana will onboard the projects that will drive the next wave of crypto adoption. Therefore, Solana could undoubtedly enjoy the kind of run Ethereum did in 2021. This explains why the asset manager is bullish on SOL’s growth, as they predict it will eventually become the third-largest crypto token after Bitcoin and Ethereum.

    "content": "An analyst has explained how profit-taking looks to have finished for Bitcoin in what has been a “very healthy reset” for the market. Bitcoin SOPR Suggests Profit-Taking From Investors Has Cooled Off In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed about the latest trend occurring in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). The SOPR is an on-chain indicator that basically tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling their coins at a profit or loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the average holder in the sector could be assumed to be moving coins at some net profit currently. On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies loss realization is the dominant mode of selling in the market. Related Reading Chainlink Becomes Crypto Winner With 21% Rally: What’s Driving This? 5 days ago Naturally, the SOPR being exactly equal to 1 suggests the total profits being realized are exactly equal to the losses at the moment and thus, the investors are just breaking-even on their selling. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been neutral in recent days | Source: @woonomic on X As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOPR had spiked to highly positive levels earlier when the cryptocurrency’s price had observed its rally towards a new all-time high (ATH). This would suggest that the investors had been participating in some aggressive profit-taking during this run. From the chart, it’s visible that such a trend was also observed around the start of the 2021 bull run. With the consolidation, the asset has gone through since the ATH, the indicator’s value has also seen a cooldown. As Woo has highlighted in the chart, the metric has now approached the neutral mark. It would appear that two months after the profit-taking peaked, the appetite for harvesting gains has potentially finally disappeared among the investors. The analyst says this is a very healthy reset for the cryptocurrency, especially as the capital inflows have once again been picking up for the coin. Looks like the indicator has gone through a turnaround recently | Source: @woonomic From the chart, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin network flows had been following an overall downward trajectory earlier when the consolidation was taking place, but recently, capital injections into the coin have once again been on the rise. Related Reading Bitcoin Still Has “A Lot Of Room To Run Before Reversal,” Says Top Analyst 5 days ago This is a similar trend to what was observed earlier in the year during the crash following the approval of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital and a notable Bitcoin advocate, recently discussed on CNBC’s Squawk Box how US pension funds are beginning to invest in BTC. “When you do the homework on Bitcoin, you go towards Bitcoin…sometimes when you’re early you get some bumps and scrapes, but I think it pays to be early in Bitcoin and we are still early in Bitcoin,” says SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci. pic.twitter.com/HTfbwH5VJG — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) May 16, 2024 This move by institutional investors, such as the State of Wisconsin Investment Board’s approximately $100 million investment in BTC, signals a broader acceptance and integration of BTC into traditional financial portfolios. Scaramucci emphasized that institutional BTC adoption is unfolding rapidly, and he anticipates more pension funds will pursue Bitcoin investments. He pointed out that regulatory approvals have opened the doors for large-scale institutional participation in BTC. This endorsement will make Bitcoin a staple in these institutions’ long-term asset allocation strategies. According to Scaramucci, understanding Bitcoin and the history of money is key to recognizing its potential.

    "content": "Uniswap Labs, the creator of one of the largest decentralized trading platforms, is challenging a potential enforcement action by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing that crypto tokens should not be classified as securities. The New York-based firm recently refuted the allegation that it operated as an unregistered exchange and broker-dealer. This response follows the SEC’s issuance of a Wells Notice to Uniswap Labs, signaling its intent to recommend legal action against the company. Uniswap Labs Challenges SEC’s Claims In a 40-page filing submitted to the SEC, Uniswap Labs outlined numerous reasons why the agency’s pursuit of legal action should be reconsidered. The SEC’s claims are primarily based on the assumption that all tokens are securities, a premise that Uniswap Labs disputes. Related Reading Institutional Investors Pour $942 Million Into Bitcoin, Will This Trigger A Rally To $80,000? 1 day ago Marvin Ammori, Chief Legal Officer of Uniswap Labs, emphasized that tokens are merely a file format for value and not inherently securities. He criticized the SEC’s attempt to redefine the terms “exchange,” “broker,” and “investment contract” to encompass Uniswap’s operations. This year, the SEC has taken action against numerous crypto firms through Wells notices, lawsuits, or settlements. The commission’s scrutiny has increasingly focused on Ethereum and decentralized finance players, including Uniswap, ShapeShift, TradeStation, and Consensys. Additionally, reports suggest that the Ethereum Foundation is under investigation. Distinction Between Tokens And Securities Uniswap Labs believes that the SEC’s case against them is flawed. It fails to recognize the distinction between tokens as files for value and tokens as securities. If the SEC proceeds with a lawsuit accusing Uniswap Labs of operating as an unregistered exchange, it risks facing adverse consequences regarding its authority over crypto tokens. Uniswap Labs warned that such litigation could set a precedent undermining the SEC’s ongoing rulemaking efforts. The company expressed its willingness to litigate if necessary and expressed confidence in a favorable outcome, stating: But we’re prepared to fight. Our lawyers are 2-0 in high-profile SEC cases. Andrew Ceresney, a former head of enforcement at the SEC, represented Ripple in their victory over the SEC. Don Verrilli, a former U.S. solicitor general, has argued more than 50 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and represented Grayscale in its successful case against the SEC. Related Reading Why Is The Ethereum Price Up 20% Today? 1 day ago SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has consistently maintained that decentralized exchanges are not genuinely decentralized and should fall under the regulator’s purview. Gensler has also argued that many digital assets qualify as unregistered securities subject to SEC regulations. Uniswap Labs, in its response, contended that its governance token, UNI, does not meet the requirements of the Howey Test, a legal framework used to evaluate investment contracts. The company also disputed the SEC’s classification of LP tokens, which are used as securities for liquidity provision in Uniswap pools. Uniswap Labs asserted that LP tokens are accounting tools rather than investment instruments. Uniswap’s native token UNI has seen significant gains of nearly 20% in the last 24 hours alone, as the market rebounded from a two-month consolidation period to trade at $9.34.

    "content": "Youtuber and Internet investigator Coffeezilla has called out Artificial Intelligence (AI) company Rabbit for allegedly being built on a $6 million non-fungible token (NFT) scam. The company is accused of being responsible for the GAMA NFT Project “fraud” as part of a history of lies. Related Reading Fake NFT Project Hack? CTO Vanishes After Allegedly Stealing 94 SOL 1 month ago Down The NFT Fraud Rabbit Hole Stephen Findeisen, better known as Coffeezilla, published a YouTube video calling out Rabbit Inc. for being built on the remains of an alleged NFT fraud from 2021. The internet investigator revealed that the company is seemingly trying to hide its ties to the GAMA project. Coffeezilla unveiled the depth of the AI company’s rabbit hole by claiming that, despite raising over $30 million in venture capital (VC), Rabbit used to be called Cyber Manufacture Corporation. In 2021, the company raised over $6 million for its “next-generation NFT Project GAMA.” The project was described as a decentralized organization “with the grand goal of sending 10,000 astronauts into space to collect extraterrestrial energy.” At the time, GAMA’s founder Jesse Lyu would make “wild promises,” claiming the NFTs were just the start. According to the YouTube sleuth, Lyu declared they would create “the first-ever carbon-negative cryptocurrency powered by our sun.” The founder promised to build a clean energy grid through NFT sales owned by NFT buyers. The grid’s energy would be used to mine GAMA tokens. However, the tokens were never launched, and the project seemed to be abandoned. Its team replied to Coffeezilla’s request for comment, stating that GAMA was not abandoned but “open-sourced.” Moreover, they claimed a token was never promised, as Lyu said in 2021 that his words were not final. The team added that they live in a country that “values free speech.” Nonetheless, the internet investigator found that the “open-sourced” engine constantly crashed and was non-functional after several tests. He also highlighted that Lyu stated in several discord messages that the project’s cryptocurrency was part of the roadmap. Based on this, Coffeezilla questioned where the $6 million in funding went and whether Lyu’s new project should be trusted. Another Rabbit In The Hat? GAMA’s founder has embarked on a new project unrelated to NFTs. His latest company, Rabbit, focuses on AI technology. The company went viral in early 2024, raising $30 million in VC and selling over $20 million in consumer products. Rabbit launched their AI personal assistance device, Rabbit R1, on easter 2024. However, the project has received a lot of backlash for not living up to the hype and promises. Several tech reviewers concurred that R1 was part of a trend of releasing “unfinished” products. According to YouTuber Marques Brownlee, Rabbit’s product was “barely reviewable” and the pinnacle of “delivering barely finished products to win a race.’” Moreover, founder and CTO of WeGPT, Josh Ollin, called the project a “scam” when R1 was announced. He also pointed out on different occasions that the hype and interactions around the company were “fake impressions” from bots. Ollin called Lyu an “NFT grifter” and stated that his past behavior affected the new project due to the “shady insincere fraudulent business practices on display (fake engagement, fake bot followers, fake tech stack, overpriced vaporware).” Coffeezilla stated a similar sentiment in his video: So many of the promises of Gama didn’t happen. This is relevant to the R1 not just because this project is built on the skeleton of that scam project, it’s also because the R1 is overhyped in a similar way. Related Reading Altcoins ‘Maniac Phase’ Preparing, Analysts Call For Next Leg Up 18 hours ago As noted by the internet sleuth, Lyu has diminished his links to GAMA NFT, calling it a “fun little project” he was “involved with” during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, he considers it important for users to know the company’s “history of abandoning investors like they did with GAMA NFT.” According to the weekly chart, the total crypto market capitalization is at $2.51 trillion.

Related Reading Why Is The Ethereum Price Up 20% Today? 1 day ago Experts and market watchers have reassured investors that the price corrections were part of the cycle, predicting that the bullish rally would resume after the cool-off. Now, analysts consider that altcoins are about to embark on a “massive leg higher” for the alt season. Ethereum’s Surge Refuels Sentiment The crypto market is up by 8.3%, with a market capitalization of $2.55 trillion. This market surge has seen Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, soar past $70,000 in the last day. Similarly, the “king of altcoins” remarkably performed these past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH)’s price has risen 22% since yesterday, surpassing levels not seen since mid-March. However, ETH is yet to test its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, set nearly two years ago. As a result, the second-largest cryptocurrency has been criticized this cycle for being “a major disappointment.” In a turn of events, rumors of an approval of ETH spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have refueled investors’ bullish tank, “erasing 65 days of down only” with a single daily candle. As ETH rallies, analysts believe it’s only a matter of time before the whole altcoins sector surges to kick off the altcoin season. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted the ‘Crypto Money Flow Cycle’, stating that, now that BTC and ETH have rallied, “it’s time for Altcoins to rally.” Is The Altcoins Season Here? During the slowdowns, market watchers have analyzed altcoins’ run this cycle. Altcoin Sherpa has stated that many tokens didn’t “run that hard” during round 1 of the bull run, resulting in his forecast of a 1-4 months “cool-off” period before resuming the uptrend. Despite the similarities with previous bull runs, the singularities of this cycle, like the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the Memecoin pre-sale frenzy, have made investors question whether they would see the alt season this time. Nonetheless, several analysts, who urged investors not to panic before, suggest the community prepares for the “maniac phase” ahead. Crypto Yoddha shared his chart for the 2024 altcoin cycle, stating that the dip was “just a higher low in an uptrend.” Altcoin 2024 Cycle. Source: Crypto Yoddha on X Per the chart, the altcoins market is now looking to retest the $1.27 trillion resistance level seen in March before testing last cycle’s $1.7 trillion ATH. To crypto Yoddha, “we’re looking at the bullish continuation” that will lead to a new market ATH during round 2. Similarly, Top analyst Michaël van de Poppe, who recently sold all his BTC for Altcoins, stated that the Altcoin market capitalization has finished its correction: The next step: reaching all-time high, which is ~60-70% from here. I think #Ethereum is likely reaching that in the next 2-4 months.

The analyst compared the market’s recent breakout to a ball being held underwater, claiming that “it’s time for history to repeat.” Altcoin’s market capitalization is at $1.15 trillion.

    "content": "Titan of Crypto, a well-known cryptocurrency trader and expert, in a daring prediction that has drawn the attention of the crypto community, forecasting an impending significant rally for Ethereum (ETH) to unprecedented heights while putting his next price target for the crypto asset at the pivotal $5,300 level. The analyst’s prognosis indicates that Ethereum, fueled by favorable market circumstances and rising investors’ confidence, is poised for massive gains. This forecast comes at the heel of ETH’s recent robust price performance and increasing market optimism. Ethereum Path To Massive Rally In February, Titan of Crypto hinted at the formation of a Bullish Cypher Pattern on Ethereum‘s weekly chart. “Just like for Bitcoin, a bullish cypher pattern is currently playing out on ETH weekly chart as well,” he stated. Related Reading Ethereum Price Rally: Far from Over, More Gains Ahead! 17 hours ago Due to this, the expert pointed out several targets for the asset to reach in the near term, such as $2,410, $2,881, $3,353, and $4,024, indicating a 38.20%, 50.00%, 61.80%, 78.60% upswingm respectively, from the current price then. Earlier this month, Titan of Crypto noted that the bullish cypher pattern has successfully developed, and the aforementioned price targets have all been achieved, suggesting a substantial rally is on the horizon. Potential rally to $5,300 level | Source: Titan of Crypto on X At that time, the crypto expert underscored that ETH was at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, which he also dubbed the 1st stop ($2,880). Should the coin manage to sustain this level, Titan of Crypto anticipates a move on the upside from the level. However, today, as predicted by the expert, Ethereum performed a flawless recovery from the 1st stop ($2,880) point. As a result, the crypto asset is currently forming a bull flag pattern on the weekly timeframe, citing $5,300 as the next price target for ETH to reach. However, this is not the final destination, suggesting the potential for Ethereum to surge even higher in the upcoming months. With ETH displaying strong price performance, it could mean that the Altcoin season could be coming into play in the near future. Indicator That Suggests A Price Correction On The Downside Although Titan of Crypto anticipates a massive rally for ETH, Ali Martinez has underlined the potential for the asset to decline soon. According to Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential indicator on Ethereum’s 4-hour timeframe on May 15, previously displayed a promising buy signal. This development practically led to a 32% rise in the price of Ethereum. Related Reading Expert Sets Timeline For When Ethereum Price Will Begin Rally To $10,000 5 days ago However, now that the ETH Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are generating so much buzz, the indicator has transitioned to a sell signal. Consequently, Ali Martinez predicts a downward correction of one to four candlesticks. At the time of writing, ETH had increased by over 28% in the past week, trading at around $3,728. Despite the recent price momentum, the asset’s market cap and trading volume are down by 1.56% and 28%, respectively.

    "content": "We had the opportunity to speak with Yinghao from SevenX Ventures about their latest investment in UXLINK, a globally leading social platform focusing on Web3-powered group building. Yinghao shared insights into why SevenX Ventures believes in UXLINK’s potential and how it aligns with the core principles of Web3. Can you tell us about SevenX Ventures’ decision to invest in UXLINK? “SevenX Ventures is thrilled to announce our investment in UXLINK,” Yinghao began. “We see UXLINK striking a delicate balance at the intersection of fundamental social principles and core Web3 concepts. Starting from the first principles of social interaction, UXLINK has leveraged profound insights into the real needs and pain points of Web3 users and projects. This has allowed them to catalyze network effects and harness intrinsic Web3 incentives and wealth effects.” What makes UXLINK stand out in the Web3 social platform space? “UXLINK has quickly become the fastest-growing network with the highest quality user accumulation and strongest monetization capability among group-oriented Web3 social platforms,” Yinghao explained. “With its core principles of openness, modularity, and convenience, UXLINK has created a user-friendly development environment for various projects and developers. This enables deep and targeted connections between projects and their user bases, solidifying network depth and expanding network boundaries. From this perspective, we are bullish on UXLINK’s ability to foster asset issuance and trading through socialization, becoming a key hub linking Web3 infrastructure and application scenarios.” Can you highlight some of UXLINK’s achievements and milestones? “UXLINK has introduced a groundbreaking user connection method and organizational structure through its ‘Link To Earn’ mechanism and disruptive ‘Web3-enabled groups,\u0027” Yinghao noted. “This has led to the establishment of a unique protocol and data layer that provides substantial value to developers operating in the Web3 space. Currently, UXLINK boasts a user base of over 5.7 million registered users, with more than 100,000 groups. It also records over 1 million daily active users (DAUs) on DApps and over 300,000 on-chain daily active users (DAUs). Additionally, UXLINK’s first-season airdrop is in progress, targeting the top 10% of users and surpassing a scale of 550,000.” What is the narrative behind UXLINK’s product and ecosystem? “UXLINK is dedicated to leading an integrated social ecosystem aimed at channeling Web3 traffic, social trading, and infrastructure,” Yinghao shared. “The product ecosystem is structured into three distinct layers: Application Layer: This layer encompasses UX Discover and Social DEX, facilitating users in social discovery, participation, and investment within group contexts. It also empowers third-party developers to craft diverse applications tailored to user preferences. Protocol Layer: At the core of UXLINK’s architecture lies its protocol layer, housing social protocols grounded in real-world relationships. This framework grants users true ownership over their social connections and data. Developers leverage these protocols to deliver personalized user experiences, including AI-driven algorithms, recommendations, and group formations. By addressing the challenge of data silos prevalent in the Web3 landscape, social data becomes a potent resource for innovation. Social Liquidity Layer (Planned): The forthcoming Social Liquidity Layer aims to establish a user-centric infrastructure that tokenizes social relationships and data assets. This layer facilitates their seamless transfer across various public chains and DApps in a secure manner. Both the Protocol and Social Liquidity layers serve as robust infrastructure for developers, offering unique opportunities for innovation and user engagement.” Product architecture diagram: How does UXLINK approach authentic socialization and trusted networks? “UXLINK embodies a shift towards genuine social connections and experiences, coupled with innovation in Web3 fundamentals,” Yinghao stated. “At the heart of UXLINK is a focus on authentic interpersonal relationships that mirror real-life social dynamics. Trust, established through direct or indirect endorsements, is crucial for actions like recommendations and transactions. UXLINK’s architecture is designed to harness the power of genuine socialization, essentially functioning as a sophisticated data production machine. This generates various types of data, ranging from basic acquaintance connections to more intricate associations such as person-group, person-network, person-project, and person-asset relationships.” What are UXLINK’s strategies for assets and finance in the Web3 landscape? “UXLINK focuses on activating existing asset trading, facilitating the issuance and circulation of new assets, and accommodating different types of assets,” Yinghao elaborated. “By transforming personal relationships into valuable network assets, UXLINK increases the turnover frequency of assets and supports the issuance of new assets with new narratives and standards. On the financial side, UXLINK ensures that users directly benefit from their contributions to the ecosystem, promoting a sustainable and engaging environment.” How does UXLINK function as a connector in the Web3 ecosystem? “UXLINK serves as a super-connector, acting as a central hub between two interconnected closed loops,” Yinghao explained. “Firstly, it links users, products, and developers, addressing core needs and fostering a robust user-product community. Secondly, it bridges infrastructure, traffic, and applications, enhancing cohesion and collaboration in the fragmented Web3 landscape.” What advantages does UXLINK’s team bring to the table? “The UXLINK team epitomizes the configuration of a typical S-tier founder leading an S-tier team,” Yinghao highlighted. “With several years of entrepreneurial experience in the internet industry, the team possesses exceptional expertise in product research and development, growth strategies, operations, and fundraising. Their commitment to first principles ensures a robust product-market fit, starting from actual user needs and integrating Web3 concepts effectively.” What potential does UXLINK hold for establishing core resources in Web3? “As the pioneer of Web3 social products deeply rooted in personal relationships, UXLINK is rapidly constructing personal networks and achieving a phase of leadership,” Yinghao emphasized. “The platform’s objective monopoly on personal networks extends to defining scenarios and pricing resources, reinforcing its dominance in the Web3 space. The self-reinforcing networks of acquaintances and brands further enhance its value.” How does UXLINK balance purist and pragmatist approaches in Web3? “UXLINK’s approach of ’embracing both sides’ offers a promising middle ground between decentralization and user experience,” Yinghao concluded. “By integrating decentralization with user-friendly incentives, UXLINK aims to create a more balanced and user-friendly Web3 ecosystem. This approach bridges the gap between purist and pragmatist developers, fostering sustainable and widely adopted applications.” In summary, Yinghao’s insights reveal UXLINK’s thoughtful balance between idealism and practicality in Web3, creating meaningful value for developers and users alike. SevenX Ventures is confident in UXLINK’s potential to become a key hub linking Web3 infrastructure and application scenarios.\n\n",

Adler predicts a 300-day bull run fueled by healthy short-term holder profits and a market with plenty of fight left in it.

This metric reveals if short-term holders are cashing out at a profit. Currently, the 90-day moving average for STH SOPR sits at 1.015, indicating short-term holders are in the green but haven’t reached the knockout blow levels seen in previous bull runs (around 1.06). This suggests there’s room for more profit-taking punches before the bulls grow weary. I’ve already mentioned that the bull market is in full swing.

Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 21, 2024 Open Interest: The Untapped Reserve Of Strength Another weapon in the bull’s arsenal is Open Interest (OI), a metric reflecting the total amount of outstanding derivative contracts (futures and options) held by traders. While the recent price surge has been impressive, the 7-day moving average for OI hasn’t witnessed the dramatic rise seen in prior bull runs. This, according to Adler, signifies a hidden reserve of strength in the market, with more firepower waiting to be unleashed. Technical Edge: Bulls Have Momentum On Their Side But technical analysis isn’t just about fancy ratios and cryptic charts. Adler identifies several technical indicators that paint a bullish picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a gauge of momentum, hasn’t broken past 70, a level often associated with overbought conditions. Bitcoin is currently trading at $70.046. Chart: TradingView This suggests the current rally is healthy and sustainable. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has surged past positive 0.05 territory, indicating significant capital inflow and a growing appetite for Bitcoin among investors.

While the bulls seem to have the upper hand, there are still hurdles to overcome. Key resistance levels loom at $79k, $88k, and $97k, identified using Fibonacci extension levels. These price points could act as roadblocks for the surging Bitcoin price. However, if the current momentum continues, these resistance levels could be shattered, paving the way for a potential retest of the all-time high at $73,700 and a possible upward motion beyond.

    "content": "Institutional investors are doubling their bets on Bitcoin, with investment funds related to the flagship crypto recording massive inflows last week. This development signals a bullish sentiment among these investors which could trigger a Bitcoin rally to $80,000. Bitcoin Investment Funds Record $942 Million In Inflows According to CoinShares’ latest weekly report, Bitcoin investment products recorded a net inflow of $942 million. These inflows are said to have been “an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report on Wednesday,” with 89% of the total flows coming in the latter three trading days of last week. Related Reading Crypto Analyst Sounds Warning Alarm For Potential 50-60% Crash In Chainlink Price, Here’s Why 2 days ago The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data, which came in lower than expected, is believed to have restored investors’ confidence in the market. The data showed that inflation in the US may be slowing, raising the prospect of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. Lower interest rates are good for the crypto market since they will make investors more willing to invest in risk assets like Bitcoin. The US accounted for most of the inflows into BTC, with $1 billion flowing into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs last week. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has recorded over $16 billion in outflows since the ETF approval in January, also saw inflows (for the first time) of $18 million last week. This trend of significant inflows into these Spot Bitcoin ETFs likely continues this week. Farside investors revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that these funds recorded a net inflow of $237.2 million on May 20. Interestingly, none of these Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows on the day, with GBTC recording an inflow of $9.3 million. It is also worth noting that while BTC saw inflows of $942 million, there were almost no flows into short Bitcoin, with CoinShares noting that this implies a positive outlook amongst investors. Altcoins like Solana, Chainlink, and Cardano also recorded considerable inflows, with $4.9 million, $3.7 million, and $1.9 million flowing into these crypto tokens, respectively. BTC’s Bull Run Might Be Back On With the Spot Bitcoin ETFs again seeing impressive demand and recording significant inflows, there is a feeling that Bitcoin’s bull run might be in full force. These investment funds were known to have contributed significantly to the flagship crypto’s hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,750 in March.

Besides the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, other factors contribute to a bullish continuation for BTC. One is the macroeconomic data, which shows that the economic situation in the US could be improving. Meanwhile, from a technical analysis perspective, the worst looks over for Bitcoin with crypto analyst Rekt Capital, revealing that the crypto token has left the post-halving danger zone.

    "content": "An analyst has explained how Polygon could see a rally of around 17% if the cryptocurrency’s price breaks above this level. Parallel Channel May Reveal What Could Be Next For Polygon In a post on X, analyst Ali has discussed about a parallel channel that Polygon has been consolidating inside during the last few weeks. The “parallel channel” here refers to a technical analysis (TA) pattern that’s drawn using two parallel trendlines. This pattern’s upper line joins successive tops in the asset while the lower one connects bottoms. While the price is inside the region bounded by these two lines (the “channel”), it’s probable to stay trapped in it, only consolidating sideways. Related Reading Analyst Says $71,000 Bitcoin Move Is Only Halfway Through, Here’s Why 22 hours ago Naturally, retests of the upper line can likely result in reversals back to the downside, while the lower one may act as a source of support, helping the coin bottom out and regain an uptrend. There are different types of parallel channels in TA, like the ascending and descending ones, where the channel is slopped upwards or downwards. In the context of the current topic, though, a parallel channel parallel to the time axis is of interest. This means consolidation inside this channel occurs between the same top and bottom levels. Like with other consolidation patterns in TA, a break out of the trendlines of the parallel channel can also suggest a continuation of the trend in that direction. More specifically, a surge above the pattern can suggest bullish momentum for the asset, while a drop under the channel may spell a bearish outcome instead. Now, here is a chart that shows how the parallel channel that Polygon has been consolidating inside has looked like over the past month: The channel that the price of the asset has been stuck inside in recent weeks | Source: @ali_charts on X From the above graph, it’s visible that Polygon has been stuck in consolidation inside this parallel channel since the cryptocurrency crash last month. The asset has made some attempts at the upper level, but so far, all of them have failed, with the coin unable to find any break. MATIC is currently floating near the level, so another retest may be coming up soon. Related Reading Bulls In Control: Ethereum Longs See Biggest Candle Ever After ETF News 1 day ago If the Polygon price surges above the channel this time, it may enjoy some sustained bullish momentum. “A breakout above $0.76 could trigger a 17% surge, pushing $MATIC to $0.88!” notes Ali. This price target is based on the fact that the crash last month, which threw the asset into this consolidation, occurred starting from around that level. Given this potential retest of the upper line of the channel, it now remains to be seen how the cryptocurrency performs in the coming days. MATIC Price Polygon almost touched the $0.76 upper level of the channel yesterday, but the coin has since observed a pullback, and it’s now back down to $0.72.

For instance, the dog-themed token WIF surged to over $4 billion market cap earlier this year despite having no use case. Sealana’s team hopes to replicate this viral success as its community grows daily. The SEAL presale has been highly successful, with early investors eagerly buying in at 1 $SOL for 6,900 SEAL. The presale website facilitates easy purchases using ETH, USDT, or credit/debit cards. Sealana also receives endorsements from influential YouTube creators like My Financial Friend and Jacob Bury.

A prominent Crypto Analyst who has since been tracking Bitcoin’s movements has recently revealed insights into the asset’s latest trends, signaling a notable move ahead for BTC.

Crypto analyst Rekt Capital earlier today highlighted on the X platform that a weekly candle close above approximately $71,500 could potentially initiate a breakout from the current “Re-Accumulation Range.” However, the analysts disclosed that history suggests that Bitcoin may need to consolidate within this range for several more weeks to align more closely with historical Halving Cycles, which have previously influenced its price trajectory. #BTC A Weekly Candle Close above ~$71500 would probably kickstart the breakout from the Re-Accumulation Range However, history suggests Bitcoin should consolidate inside this Re-Accumulation Range for several weeks more Extended consolidation here would get Bitcoin closer to… pic.twitter.com/Af0W4MMBTN — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 21, 2024 This extended consolidation period, as highlighted by the analyst, could benefit Bitcoin’s long-term growth. Particularly, it could help the cryptocurrency “resynchronize” with previous cycles, potentially leading to a longer and more sustained bull run, as opposed to a shorter, more accelerated cycle that peaks sooner. Rekt Capital noted: After all, the current acceleration in the cycle is still around 190 days (which is an improvement from the 260-day acceleration set in mid-March when BTC made new All Time Highs) The analyst pointed out that while both scenarios are bullish, the preference between a shorter or a typically longer bull run remains a matter of market speculation. Currently, the discussion revolves around whether Bitcoin can continue to defy historical trends with a break above the $71,500 range. BTC price is moving sideways on the 2-hour chart.

Back then, Bitcoin saw a significant rise, recording a 1,200% increase on its way to the previous high of $20,000. TechDev’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin could be setting up for another parabolic rise, potentially reaching as high as $100,000, especially given its longer consolidation period in the current market cycle compared to 2017. Supporting this viewpoint, RektCapital hinted that even a price of $72,000 would seem modest in the coming months if Bitcoin continues on its projected path. #BTC Even $72000 will be a low price for Bitcoin, months from now$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 20, 2024 Notably, the surge in Bitcoin’s price recorded so far is influenced by a mix of optimism and anticipation surrounding the potential approval of Ethereum spot ETFs and increasing inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs.

However, this stability might contradict the typical trading behavior associated with crypto, where volatility often presents trading opportunities. Moreover, if these whales hold onto their Bitcoin rather than sell, this behavior could be interpreted as a long-term bullish signal. It suggests that these influential market players see the potential for future price increases and are choosing to hold their positions.

    "content": "Zeebu, the industry-leading payments and settlement platform, has reached a new milestone, surpassing $2 billion in total settlement volume, a testament to the platform’s robust growth and strategic positioning within the telecom and Web3 payments sector. The growth of Zeebu must be contextualized within the broader expansion of the blockchain-based transaction space, where it is not only participating but leading the charge. In just a few months following the launch of Zeebu’s on-chain settlement platform, the company impressively managed to settle thousands of invoices, rapidly progressing from an initial $1 billion to now surpassing $2 billion in transactions. This growth underscores the platform’s scalability and the robust demand for its services. Zeebu has become a pivotal player in blockchain-based settlements for the telecom sector, offering an instant payment and settlement solution that significantly reduces transaction times from days to minutes and cuts out intermediaries through the use of smart contract technology. The core of Zeebu’s innovation is the ZBU Token, which not only facilitates global transactions but also enhances participant engagement through a loyalty and rewards system. This tokenization strategy effectively tackles common financial hurdles like high fees, delays in remittance, and issues with currency exchange, making it an ideal solution for cross-border settlements. The platform’s usage has expanded substantially, with a growing number of telecom carriers and businesses leveraging Zeebu’s capabilities. As the platform evolves, Zeebu continues to attract new users who recognize its benefits, reinforcing its position as a trusted and leading payment platform in the market. The data from Zeebu’s dashboard reveals that the overall transaction volume on the platform has already crossed over $2 Billion. At the time of writing, the number of invoices settled stands at 32k+, with total users around 465. Some of the company’s achievements this year included two massive token burn events and participation in leading telecom and Web3 events across the globe. The first token burn occurred in February 2024, removing over 236 million ZBU tokens from circulation, accounting for more than 4.7% of the total supply. The second burn took place in May 2024, removing an additional 239 million ZBU tokens, reinforcing Zeebu’s commitment to a sustainable token ecosystem through its Phoenix Protocol, which automates and governs the burn process to ensure a balanced token supply. In addition to these token burns, Zeebu has actively expanded its presence by participating in and sponsoring major telecom and Web3 events across the Middle East, the Americas, and other regions. This strategic involvement has helped Zeebu establish a strong foothold in these markets and increase its brand visibility. To further raise awareness about Zeebu, the company partnered with CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko to host several campaigns. These efforts, coupled with listings on prominent exchanges, have significantly enhanced Zeebu’s market presence and credibility. Moreover, Zeebu released a major update to its Payment Service Provider (PSP) platform, introducing governance features that enable telecom merchants to transition from passive users to active participants in the ecosystem. This update enhances the overall user experience and fosters a more engaged community within the Zeebu platform. Raj Brahmbhatt, Founder and CEO of Zeebu, added, “This milestone is a significant leap forward in our journey, clearly aligning with our broader strategic goals. As the telecom industry increasingly embraces innovative payment solutions such as blockchain, our extensive experience and proven ability to provide exceptional user experiences and customized financial solutions uniquely position us to meet the growing demands of this dynamic sector.” Looking ahead, Zeebu is set to further enhance its services, expand its ecosystem, and transition towards a more decentralized and community-driven governance model.

Bitcoin Has Been Reacting To Binance/Coinbase Volume Changes In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the dynamics in the cryptocurrency market that arise out of the battle happening between Binance and Coinbase for spot volume dominance.

The spot volume share of the two giant exchanges | Source: CryptoQuant As the graph shows, Binance has been the much more dominant of the two platforms when considering the spot volume. The exchange is hosting five times as much volume as Coinbase. The analyst notes that the difference between the two would be even higher when considering the BTC-FDUSD pair, which isn’t included in the data depicted in the above chart. Despite the much lower spot volume, Coinbase still hasn’t been irrelevant in the market. For example, the platform is the custodian for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC. There also appears to be an interesting pattern between the dominance of the American exchange and the Bitcoin spot price. The quant has highlighted this trend in the graph. There have been a few instances where a rise in the spot trading volume of Coinbase against Binance has preceded surges in the value of cryptocurrency. Similarly, declines in the platform’s dominance have seemingly led to drawdowns in the Bitcoin price. The analyst has also discussed the trend in the volumes of the two exchanges more closely, using the spot volume ratio for them, as shown below. The value of the metric seems to have been relatively low in recent months | Source: CryptoQuant The chart shows that the spot volume ratio between Binance and Coinbase had spiked to very high levels in 2023, with the former’s volume being 53 times the latter’s. The reason behind this was the zero-fee scheme that Binance had introduced for the Bitcoin trading pairs. However, Coinbase’s volume has recently risen, although the ratio remains notably in favor of Binance. This shift in the market emerged as the Bitcoin spot ETF-related news started to intensify.

The surge in price and trading activity has analysts like Sssebi predicting a potential bull run for ADA, citing key technical indicators and a shift in market sentiment. Related Reading Solana Leaves Competition In The Dust: Blazing Speed To Fuel Price Surge? 1 day ago Breaking Through Resistance, Bouncing Back Stronger Sssebi, a well-respected crypto analyst, recently published a detailed report highlighting ADA’s recent bullish behavior. One of the key factors Sssebi points to is the token’s successful climb above the crucial 200-day moving average (200MA) on the 4-hour chart. The 200MA is a widely used technical indicator that reflects the long-term trend of an asset. Traditionally, a price moving above the 200MA is seen as a bullish signal, suggesting a potential shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. $ADA gets a nice bounce of the 200MA on the 4hr chart with increased volume!

Insanely bullish on $ADA right now! https://t.co/YCcGY13ZSp pic.twitter.com/QyatkiCx4k — Sssebi? (@Av_Sebastian) May 21, 2024 But Sssebi’s analysis goes beyond the initial breakout. He emphasizes the significance of the retest and subsequent bounce back from the 200MA with high trading volume. This price action, according to Sssebi, suggests a robust buying force behind ADA. The previous resistance level, once a hurdle for further gains, may now act as a strong support floor, preventing sharp price drops. Volume Surge Fuels Optimism Another key element in Sssebi’s bullish outlook is the significant increase in trading volume accompanying ADA’s recent price rise. Trading volume is a crucial indicator of market interest and investor sentiment. High volume suggests a larger number of market participants are actively involved in buying and selling ADA, lending credence to the price movement. In the case of ADA, the high volume surge alongside the bounce off the 200MA strengthens Sssebi’s belief in a potential uptrend. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView The analyst’s insights have resonated with the crypto community, with many traders and investors keeping a close eye on Cardano’s developments. Sssebi’s bullish view is primarily based on technical indicators and recent market activity, suggesting the possibility of further price appreciation for ADA. However, the article published by Sssebi also underscores the importance of conducting independent research before making any investment decisions.

Cardano’s development team, Input Output Global (IOG), has been diligently working on scaling solutions and expanding the platform’s capabilities. The successful launch of smart contracts last year marked a significant milestone, and upcoming developments like the Vasil Hard Fork, aimed at improving network scalability and transaction fees, are eagerly awaited by the community.

    "content": "Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of blockchain technology firm Consensys, has expressed that the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could lead to significant supply constraints for Ether. This development is anticipated to be a “watershed” moment for Ethereum. In an exclusive interview with DL News, Lubin predicted that the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs will unlock substantial institutional demand. Given that many institutions have begun their crypto investments with spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum is naturally the next substantial asset for diversification. “There’s going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether” through these ETFs, Lubin commented. However, he also noted that the situation for Ethereum differs significantly from that of Bitcoin because of the underlying supply dynamics. A major factor distinguishing Ethereum from Bitcoin in the context of ETF creation is the availability of the assets. On-chain data indicates that more than 27% of all Ether is staked across various protocols on the Ethereum network. These funds are locked in contracts and are contributing to the network’s security and operations, thus they are not readily available for market trading. “Much of the Ether is put to work in the core protocol, DeFi systems, or in DAOs,” Lubin explained. This structural difference means that there is less Ether available for ETF providers to purchase and allocate to new ETF shares. Related Reading Ethereum Soars 20%: ETH Hype Escalates on ETF Rumors 1 day ago In August 2021, the Ethereum network’s EIP 1559 introduced a burning mechanism where a portion of the Ether used for transaction fees is permanently removed from circulation. This deflationary mechanism is designed to balance Ether supply growth and potentially increase its scarcity over time. As network activity increases—potentially spurred further by new institutional interest in Ethereum through ETFs—this burn mechanism will gradually reduce the available supply, adding another layer to the potential supply crunch. “This could be a pretty profound watershed moment”, Lubin said. Ethereum Price Targets And Doubts The market impact of an approved Ethereum spot ETF could be significant. Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher projected a possible scenario where Ethereum could see a price surge similar to that experienced by Bitcoin following its own ETF approval. According to Deutscher’s analysis, “BTC rallied 75% in 63 days after the spot ETF was approved. If ETH follows the same trend (if approved), this would take it to $6,446 by July 23.” $BTC rallied 75% in 63 days after the spot ETF was approved. If $ETH follows the same trend (if approved), this would take it to $6,446 by July 23. pic.twitter.com/FfWg9VGUMx — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) May 21, 2024 However, opinions among analysts vary. Vetle Lunde from K33 Research pointed out the challenges in replicating Bitcoin’s success, noting that the futures-based Ethereum ETFs have only captured a small fraction of the assets compared to their Bitcoin counterparts prior to spot ETF approval. “Fut-based ETH ETFs have seen cumulative net inflows of $126m since launch ~ roughly equivalent to the inflow to BITX over the past 3 days. Fut-based ETH ETFs aggregated AUM is only 7.4% of the AUM fut-based BTC ETFs had before the spot approval,” he remarked.

This could result in the ETFs not fully reflecting the underlying value growth of Ethereum price, as also highlighted by Alex Thorn, Head of Research at crypto-focused financial services firm Galaxy commented: “Lack of staking in ETH ETPs would be material for returns. If u bought $10k ETH on Merge day in Sep ‘22 and held until today without staking it, you underperformed by 8% over that period vs someone who bought and staked to collect issuance, tips, and MEV.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,759.

    "content": "Bitcoin whales are not backing down from the market and have continued to capitalize on the pump by buying every dip. The most recent dip toward $60,000 saw these large investors gobble up BTC at an alarming rate, with their daily spending coming in at billions of dollars. Bitcoin Whales Buy $6.3 Billion Worth Of BTC In a stunning discovery, co-founder of Bitcoin-based company Apollo, Thomas Fahrer, revealed that Bitcoin whales have been rapidly buying up the tokens amid price drawdown. More specifically, the daily spend of these whales caught Fahrer’s eye. Related Reading Solana Cup And Handle Pattern Means An At Least 90% Move Against Ethereum, Analyst Says 21 hours ago The report shared by the founder shows that while smaller investors had been selling, Bitcoin whales were buying up billions of dollars worth of coins. In the 24-hour period, these whales holding more than 1,000 BTC on their balances accumulated 8,953 BTC, worth $6.3 billion at the time. This further adds to their weekly accumulation numbers, coming out at 12,058 BTC, which is almost $9 billion worth of BTC bought in one week. Whales accumulated $6.3 Billion worth of #Bitcoin Yesterday. So c’mon now, fess up. Who’s selling? pic.twitter.com/3dLD2BI89L — Thomas | heyapollo.com (@thomas_fahrer) May 22, 2024 This accumulation trend comes in light of smaller investors selling their tokens. For example, Fahrer’s screenshot show Sharks, which are investors holding between 100-1,000 BTC on their balances sold 6,746 BTC in one day, worth around $5 billion. Other notable sellers include the crabs, which are investors holding 1-10 BTC, selling 1,074 BTC in the same time period. Shrimps – investors holding 0-1 BTC, were also caught selling, with a total of 591 BTC sold. While Fish investors, those holding 10-100 BTC, sold only 95 BTC in the one day period. The flow of these investors shows that BTC is flowing out from smaller investors toward larger investors, something that is bullish for the price. The same is the case on the weekly timeframe where Shrimps sold 2,079 BTC, Crabs sold 5,748 BTC, Fish sold 1,155 BTC, while Sharks bought up 60 BTC, with Bitcoin whales buying the majority with 12,085 BTC. Time To Buy A number of crypto analysts have called for buying and it seems Bitcoin whales are the ones following this advice. One of the analysts who has been vocal about it being the time to buy is Ali Martinez, who shared an interesting formation on the Bitcoin chart. Related Reading Why Is The Ethereum Price Up 20% Today? 1 day ago Martinez pointed out that the TD Sequential, which had previously predicted the Bitcoin price movement, had flashed a buy signal. The level at which this analyst presented this buy signal was around the $69,500 level, and since then, the BTC price has since rebounded above $70,000, suggesting the buy signal was correct. The TD Sequential has accurately predicted #Bitcoin price action on the one-hour chart. Now, it presents a buy signal, anticipating $BTC will rebound! pic.twitter.com/6ImRkREPVW — Ali (@ali_charts) May 21, 2024 If the TD Sequential holds like it did the last time it appeared, then the current price push could see Bitcoin reach a new all-time high above $74,000, since the last one saw an almost 15% move. But for now, Bitcoin bulls are fighting to maintain its position above $70,000, with a 12.22% increase in the last week.

    "content": "In a recent security incident, Gala Games, a Web3 gaming company, fell victim to an exploit that led to the unauthorized minting of 5 billion tokens, equivalent to approximately $214 million. The hacker behind the breach subsequently sold 592 million GALA tokens, amounting to $21.8 million in value, as blockchain analysis firm Lookonchain confirmed. CEO Of Gala Games Takes Responsibility For Breach Gala Games responded to the breach, assuring the community via social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the security incident involving the GALA token had been contained and that the affected wallet had been frozen. The company acknowledged the isolated nature of the incident and stated that it had addressed the cause while collaborating closely with law enforcement agencies to investigate the individuals responsible for the breach. Related Reading Crypto Market Liquidations Top $330 Million In 24 Hours With Ethereum In The Lead 1 day ago Eric Schiermeyer, CEO of Gala Games, expressed his regret over the incident, referencing his previous stance on projects experiencing hacks. Schiermeyer disclosed that the breach led to the unauthorized sale of 600 million GALA tokens, equivalent to $21 million, and the subsequent burning of 4.4 billion tokens. Within 45 minutes, Gala Games identified the compromise and effectively secured and removed unauthorized access to the GALA contract. Reassuring stakeholders, Schiermeyer emphasized that the Ethereum (ETH) contract for GALA remained secure and protected by a multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet, with no compromise detected. Acknowledging internal control shortcomings, Schiermeyer also admitted responsibility for the incident and outlined the steps being taken to prevent its recurrence. Gala Games expressed confidence in identifying the culprit behind the breach. They confirmed active collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and a network of international authorities to ensure appropriate legal actions are pursued. The incident raised concerns regarding the project’s daily distribution, prompting Gala Games to propose a node vote to address the issue. As per their community-driven approach, the decision on how to proceed will be determined by the community itself. DFW Labs Support In response to the incident, DFW Labs, a Web3 investor and market maker, took action to alleviate selling pressure in the market. They purchased 28 million GALA tokens from the open market to stabilize the value of the token, which had fallen to $0.037 on Monday following the exploit. However, with the investment from DFW Labs, the token rebounded to its current trading price of $0.0431, representing a loss of 7.8% in the last 24 hours.

    "content": "QCP Capital, a prominent institutional-focused firm, has recently projected that Bitcoin could revisit its peak price levels, potentially reaching up to $74,000 shortly. This prediction follows the latest United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which has significantly boosted risk assets. The firm noted that the positive surge in the market is partly due to the renewed buy-side demand, as evidenced by the buying patterns that resemble those of Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) market makers. Related Reading Most Important Bitcoin Indicator Nears Bullish Flip: $150,000 Soon? 6 days ago Institutional Inflows And Market Indicators Point To A Bitcoin Bullish Trend In a detailed analysis shared through their Telegram channel, QCP Broadcast, the firm stated: “We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of 74k.” Substantial institutional interest in Bitcoin supports this sentiment, as large asset managers like Millennium and Schonfeld have allocated about 3% and 2% of their Assets Under Management (AUM), respectively, to spot BTC ETFs. The optimism surrounding Bitcoin is not just theoretical but backed by significant market activity. For instance, inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US reached a two-week high of $303 million as of May 15th, signaling a robust renewal of institutional confidence. Fidelity’s FBTC fund led this influx with $131 million, followed by Bitwise’s BITB fund, which saw $86 million, marking its highest since early March. Grayscale’s GBTC, which had experienced outflows for four months, reversed this trend with a $27 million inflow. Yesterday, May 15, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETFs was $303 million. Grayscale ETF GBTC had a single-day net inflow of $27.0466 million, Fidelity ETF FBTC had an inflow of $131 million, and Bitwise ETF BITB had an inflow of $86.2578 million. https://t.co/npjWVH3bMi — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 16, 2024 Further underlining this bullish sentiment, Millennium Management holds a roughly $2 billion Bitcoin ETF portfolio, making it the largest holder of specific Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. Other hedge funds, including Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital and Apollo Management Holdings, have also disclosed significant holdings in Bitcoin ETFs, showcasing the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Market Performance And Future Outlook Bitcoin’s market performance has been quite notable. It has increased nearly 10% over the past week, including a 2.7% rise in the last 24 hours alone. BTC price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com QCP Capital attributes this trend to several factors, including significant “sovereign and institutional adoption, easing inflation concerns, and the upcoming US elections,” all of which contribute to a favorable market outlook. The positive sentiment is also partly due to the CPI data released on May 15th, which met expectations and eased concerns about inflation. This is crucial as lower inflation rates influence the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates, making riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking higher yields. James Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Realvision, also cited the Global Money Supply (M2) index as a critical indicator of Bitcoin’s price movements. According to Coutts, the M2 money aggregates, which include cash and checking deposits and are easily convertible near money, are central to understanding liquidity flows within the global financial system. He noted, “The money stock often moves in one direction, with significant drops like those seen in 2022 being rare and typically brief.” Related Reading Bitcoin Breaks Free: Emerging from Bearish Sentiment, Crypto Market Optimism Rises 6 days ago Coutts predicts that any significant break above Bitcoin’s all-time highs could pave the way for it to reach around $150,000 in this cycle. He remarked, “Watch the 101/102 level on DXY. If that breaks, then we should see ~$150k BTC this cycle,” emphasizing the interplay between liquidity and market cycles.

This change has been marked by Bitcoin forming its first higher high since its drop to $56,000, as highlighted by Rekt Capital. This indicates a possible continuation of the bull market despite periodic market attempts to unsettle investors. The TD Sequential indicator’s sell signal comes as Bitcoin has shown a 7.6% increase over the past seven days, reaching a 24-hour high of $66,567 before retracing slightly to $65,592.

Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com Rekt Capital noted the significance of the $60,000 support level, suggesting that maintaining this level is crucial for further positive momentum.

    "content": "In a remarkable turn of events, Bitcoin (BTC) has broken out of its recent trading range, recording a 7% surge in the past 24 hours alone. The cryptocurrency tests the $66,000 resistance level, setting the stage for a potential move toward higher targets. The latest momentum shift in Bitcoin’s price action has caught the attention of industry experts, particularly the co-founders of on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. According to their analysis, the trigger for a larger market structure release has been in the works since the March highs. Bitcoin Breaks Out The co-founders of Glassnode believe this breakout has been coming for a long time. They state that they have been waiting for the trigger to unleash a major bullish structure since the March highs when Bitcoin reached its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,700, and it looks like the market has finally done so. Related Reading Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu to Soar 50% Amidst Meme Coin Market Rise 1 week ago They believe the trigger was the recent lower-than-expected US inflation figures and weaker retail sales data, which could prompt a more “dovish stance” from the Federal Reserve. According to the Glassnode co-founders, this opens the door to a more dovish stance from the Fed. They explain that Bitcoin and the market liked this, and now they expect the price to reach $66,000 before $69,000 and then up towards $84,000. They also believe the altcoins will follow this move strongly. However, not all analysts are as bullish in the immediate term. Crypto trader and analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin needs to hold the $65,000 level as new support, cautioning that the $68,000 and $73,000 price levels could act as resistance and liquidity pockets. He warns that if Bitcoin loses the $65,000 support, it’s back to the “chopfest” – further consolidation and volatility. Andrew Tate Considers Dumping Fiat For BTC In a surprising move, popular internet personality and self-proclaimed “Top G” Andrew Tate has announced his intention to abandon fiat currency and invest over $100 million into Bitcoin. In a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Tate declared, “I’m about to leave fiat completely and ape over 100M into BTC.” Tate, who has faced numerous legal issues and has been banned from several social media platforms, cited his frustrations with the traditional banking system and fiat currency as the driving force behind this potential decision. “I’m done with the banks. I’m done with their money. Done with the scams,” he wrote in the post.

However, he hinted that he might “leave fiat completely,” suggesting that his preference for Bitcoin and other digital assets is growing. The 1-D chart shows BTC’s trending upwards.

It remains to be seen how far the current rally can extend and whether the bullish momentum can survive potential selling pressure at higher price levels.

    "content": "Mike Novogratz, the CEO and founder of Galaxy Digital, shared his insights on the current state of the cryptocurrency market. According to Bloomberg, Novogratz predicts that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely remain within a relatively narrow trading range for the current quarter as the adoption of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance continues to evolve. Stagnant Crypto Market Per the report, Novogratz described the current phase in the crypto market as a consolidation period. He emphasized that Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), are expected to consolidate. This consolidation phase suggests that the Bitcoin price will likely trade within a range of approximately $55,000 to $75,000 until significant market events drive prices higher. Related Reading On A Tear: Toncoin Outshines Bitcoin With Price Surge And Social Buzz 1 week ago The crypto market has experienced a period of stagnation following the historic bull run witnessed in the past two quarters. This surge was fueled by the launch of spot US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the Bitcoin Halving, which reduced the supply of new BTC. However, Bitcoin’s price trend reversed due to diminishing optimism surrounding interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), amid consistently strong economic indicators. According to Novogratz’s analysis, if his predictions hold, Solana could continue to consolidate within its current trading range of $120 to $150. This consolidation has been observed over the past month, indicating a period of stability for the cryptocurrency. Similarly, Ethereum’s price has closely mirrored Bitcoin’s movements and has traded between the $2,870 and $3,200 levels. Ethereum recently failed to consolidate above the significant $4,000 mark reached in mid-March. As a result, Ethereum has experienced a period of price consolidation within the range above. Bitcoin Volatility Persists Novogratz acknowledged the tailwinds that propelled the market during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Galaxy’s CEO believes that these tailwinds will likely persist throughout the current quarter and possibly the next unless there are significant developments, such as the Fed initiating rate cuts due to an economic slowdown or until the regulatory landscape becomes clearer after the upcoming election. Moreover, Novogratz noted a significant shift in counterparties’ willingness to lend crypto for extended periods without collateral, a trend that was not prevalent just six months ago. He emphasized that engagement in the crypto space has reached a new level, with growing interest from individuals and institutions alike. Related Reading CPI Preview: Bitcoin Price Poised To Surge If Projections Hold True 1 week ago On Tuesday, Bitcoin experienced a 2.7% decline, trading at $61,400. Since achieving a record high of $73,700 on March 14, the largest cryptocurrency in the market has undergone a 16% decline. Despite this, Galaxy Digital reported notable first-quarter results, with net income more than tripling to $421.7 million. The daily chart shows that BTC’s price is trending downward.

    "content": "A crucial Bitcoin metric has just turned bullish, sparking optimism from a crypto analyst regarding an impending rally for Bitcoin. This unique technical pattern suggests that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could see its price ascending further, potentially kick-starting a highly welcomed bull run this cycle. Bitcoin Technical Pattern Flips Bullish Bitcoin’s price has often followed distinct historical patterns, with the majority of these indicators preceding significant rallies or bearish trends. One of the most compelling signs that Bitcoin may be turning bullish again is seen as the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) Oscillator breaks below the lower Bollinger Bands, a technical indicator used to measure a market’s volatility and momentum. Related Reading Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run 4 days ago According to a crypto analyst identified as ‘Dominando Cripto’ on X (formerly Twitter), the SSR is a unique technical tool designed to evaluate the market sentiment by comparing the supply of stablecoins to Bitcoin. This tool is used by analysts and traders to identify buying and selling opportunities for Bitcoin. Additionally, it quantifies how the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the SSR moves within the Bollinger Bands. Source: X Dominando Cripto has provided an in-depth explanation of how the SSR oscillator is calculated and how to interpret its signals for identifying bullish trends. “The oscillator is calculated by taking the difference between the current Stablecoin Supply Ratio value and its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), then dividing it by the standard deviation of the SSR over the same period,” the analyst stated. Sharing a price chart depicting movements of the SSR oscillator, the crypto analyst suggests that when the oscillator moves above the upper Bollinger Bands, it suggests that the SSR is significantly higher than normal levels. This indicates that stablecoins are dominating the market, signaling bearish sentiment and a potential downturn for Bitcoin. Conversely, when the oscillator falls below the lower Bollinger Band, it indicates that the SSR is low, highlighting the reduced dominance of stablecoins and signaling bullish sentiment that could potentially trigger an incoming rally in Bitcoin. In the above price chart, Dominando Crypto pinpointed several instances when the SSR oscillator displayed bearish and bullish sentiment, identifying these periods as heated zones and cold zones, respectively. Recent market movements indicate that the SSR oscillator is in the cold zone, indicating a potential bullish outlook for Bitcoin. More Bullish Signs For BTC On May 18, Blockchain analytics platform, Santiment, revealed a new market trend where small traders are consistently liquidating their BTC holdings, even as the cryptocurrency has shown positive performance lately. Related Reading This Crypto Trader Just Sold All His Bitcoin For Altcoins Like Cardano And XRP, Here’s Why 3 days ago The analytics platform noted that historically, when small wallets dump coins into larger wallets, it is considered an encouraging sign for Bitcoin, indicating a potential bullish turnaround for the pioneer cryptocurrency.

    "content": "The Bitcoin price recovery above the $67,000 level has triggered a round of selling, but it is not from the usual camp of large investors selling. This time around, it is the small-time traders who are offloading their bags and putting selling pressure on the price. However, this is not an entirely bad thing given that, historically, such selling has been bullish for the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin Retail Are Dumping Their Bags In a report on X (formerly Twitter), the on-chain data tracker Santiment revealed an interesting trend among small-time Bitcoin investors. As the price of Bitcoin rallied past $67,000 over the weekend, these small wallets took this as the time to sell and secure profit. Related Reading Cardano Whales Return To The Table, Increase Massive Holdings By 10% 4 days ago These wallets are those holding below 0.1 BTC on their balances. This means that at the high end, these wallets are holding an average of $6,000. In the space of one week, Santiment notes that their collective holdings had dropped 0.46%. ?? #Bitcoin is dancing just above $66.1K as small traders continue to #liquidate their holdings despite the #crypto bounce over the past week. Historically, small wallets dumping their coins to larger wallets is an encouraging and #bullish sign for $BTC. https://t.co/wlz4XPhfMD pic.twitter.com/dTJAy5G6pL — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 19, 2024 Selling among smaller wallets is not new, but at this level, it could have a significant impact on the price. However, compared to when whale and sharks sell their BTC holdings, retail investors selling is usually bullish for the price. This is because as the smaller traders sell, the BTC is picked up by the larger traders, who are usually longer-term holdings. As blockchain agency Crynet explains in a response to Santiment: “While small traders divesting might seem concerning, it’s often a bullish signal. Historically, this redistribution to larger holders indicates stronger hands in the market. Let’s see how this plays out.” Bullish Sentiment Rises Among Investors The selling by small Bitcoin traders comes amid a jump in bullishness. As Santiment reported in a previous post, bullishness among Bitcoin investors has now jumped to a 4-month high. The last time that investors were this bullish was back in January 2024 when the price of BTC had jumped above $45,000. Related Reading Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run 4 days ago Bitcoin’s weighted sentiment is now sitting at a value of 0.99, and although this is still lower than its January high of almost 1.8, it remains one of the highest among large caps. Currently, only the Chainlink (LINK) weighted sentiment is higher after rising to a new one-year high of 1.829. ? The crowd’s sentiment has shifted toward #Bitcoin after the surprise bounce above $66K Wednesday (and now above $67.2K). Additionally, #Chainlink is seeing its most #bullish sentiment in over a year. #FOMO staying low will help these rises continue. https://t.co/TcEPBdS9Oh pic.twitter.com/czvE1mOgId — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 17, 2024 The Ethereum weighted sentiment is currently sitting at a low -0.44, while XRP and Binance’s BNB are sitting at around -0.37. This suggests that bearishness continues to dominate among these assets while crypto investors look to Bitcoin to lead the market. At the time of writing, the BTC price is still trading at a high price of $66,900. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is seeing a 6.78% increase in the last week and a small decline of 0.5% in the last day, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

    "content": "Utility tokens of L2 blockchains serve various purposes, from granting access to ecosystem offerings to paying fees and beyond. One such token that has been garnering significant attention lately is CHO. Serving as the backbone of Choise.ai, CHO already had numerous use cases. However, the announcement of Choise.ai’s upcoming L2 blockchain, Entropy, is supposed to give CHO a substantial boost. Other utility tokens with room for growth include ARB, OP, STRK, and IMX, and we’ll explain why we believe each of these tokens can explode in the medium to long term. CHO (Entropy) As mentioned above, Choise.ai announced the forthcoming launch of Entropy, an L2 blockchain focused on B2B and enterprise, and powered by AI. CHO will lay the foundation for Entropy’s long-term growth, fostering its scalability and sustainability. This L2 will offer a no-code environment for those seeking to create, build, and flourish in the realm of Web3. This will be accomplished through the use of AI models for smart contract generation and optimization, completely eliminating human error, ensuring seamless operation, and reducing costs simultaneously. Additionally, developers will have the opportunity to monetize their AI models through integration with a blockchain-based AI model marketplace. This level of innovation has not been seen on any other blockchain, and it will be incredibly exciting to see how things unfold from here. CHO holders will be given various kinds of benefits, such as access to new platform features, airdrops, partner rewards, and more. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Other perks of holding CHO include receiving up to 20% of Choise.ai’s B2B revenue through the soon-to-be-launched VLT token, which will be exclusively credited to CHO holders, giving a super boost to their staking income. CHO will also incentivize legitimate transactions within Choise.ai’s innovative Tringlr SMPC technology, which will serve as the base for ultra-secure digital wallets. Lastly, the token was recently launched on the BSC network, with a $500,000 prize pool for transfers to BSC, aligning with Choise.ai’s vision of supporting community programs and reducing transaction costs. Given all this, it’s clear that CHO has potential matched by very few other tokens. It’s a hidden gem for anyone seeking tokens with great utility. And with the impending launch of Entropy, CHO is about to get to new heights. ARB (Arbitrum) ARB is the utility token of the Arbitrum Network, launched in May 2021 with the aim of enhancing scalability, speed, and cost-effectiveness compared to the ETH network. Indeed, Arbitrum can handle a high volume of transactions with minimal latency. ARB tokens are also used for governance within the Arbitrum DAO and serve as rewards for validation nodes. Validators can stake tokens on the network, thereby enhancing its security. Despite its strengths, ARB has encountered several challenges. For example, during the ARB airdrop scheduled for last March, a significant percentage of intended recipients, around 10,000, did not receive their tokens, while some who did were subject to high fees. Although the team resolved the issues, some participants were left with a bitter taste, leading them to exit the project. OP (Optimism) Optimism, another L2 solution, utilizes optimistic rollups, which are cheaper than pessimistic rollups, enabling smooth transaction processing without causing network congestion or exorbitant fees. These optimistic rollups ensure network security with most transactions being executed automatically, but if a transaction is suspected to be fraudulent, the system undergoes a verification process to confirm its legitimacy. The OP token has two main functions: operations and governance. Holders can vote on upgrades and proposals, earn rewards for contributions to the network, and stake their tokens. However, the main problem with this network, which you could already guess, pertains to security. While the fraud-proof scheme theoretically works, there are instances where fraudulent transactions or actions go undetected, leaving the network vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors. STRK (Starknet) Starknet is a ZK rollup for Ethereum and a Layer 2 blockchain that ensures high performance, security, and low fees using the STARK cryptographic proof system. Although the blockchain is still in development, its native token, STRK, was airdropped to the community in February. There’s a lot of excitement around Starknet, and its developer community is quite strong. Anyone looking to build on Starknet can find resources in their Developer Hub, and Cairo, the network’s native smart contract language, further simplifies things for developers. Like most other L2 native tokens, STRK can be staked, used for governance, paying transaction fees, and maintaining the network. Soon, it is expected to release a range of data availability solutions and a permissionless sequencer and prover. Although the project overall seems promising, there are some posts on Reddit suggesting it could be a pump-and-dump scenario orchestrated by venture capitalists. IMX (Immutable) Immutable X is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum NFTs that supports both NFT minting and trading with no fees, is carbon-neutral, and incredibly fast, achieving up to 9,000 transactions per second. What sets it apart from other NFT marketplaces is that trades are executed instantly, ZK rollups provide high security, it includes a built-in wallet, has a global order book that aggregates NFTs from different marketplaces, and offers APIs and SDKs that make it easy for developers to build Web3 apps. The platform’s native token, IMX, is its first and native NFT. The IMX token is used for paying transaction fees, voting, and staking on Immutable X. These tokens can also be locked in staking pools. However, despite the project’s overall strength and the token’s potential, it may not appeal to people who are not interested in NFTs. Summary It looks like 2024 is the year of L2 native tokens, and since we’re almost halfway through, some of the listed tokens have already appreciated significantly, while others still have room to grow. However, among the five, it’s clear that CHO has the greatest utility. Entropy will offer a much broader range of possibilities compared to other L2s, making CHO a token with immense potential. At its current price, it’s definitely a steal and could be a good buy.\n\n",

Prices have since recovered, but bulls have yet to break above all-time highs. While capital inflows remain moderate, Glassnode adds, volatility has decreased noticeably. Still, whether this volatility will shoot higher once $72,000 is broken remains to be seen. BTC Retraces: Will Bulls Break $72,000? All eyes are on whether BTC bulls will shake off the current correction. In a post on X, another analyst said holders shouldn’t be worried because of this pullback and the failure of bulls to confirm the May 20 leg up. Pullbacks are inevitable in bull markets | Source: @CryptoJelleNL via X Instead, the analyst is confident, saying pullbacks are a natural part of any bull market. The recent 23% correction, the analyst added, is an example. What’s important is that every retracement has been from a higher position. Therefore, the next local bottom will likely be higher than the previous one, potentially reaching around $80,000.

The bulls didn’t push through this line, even with more serious attempts in early April. As a result, this reaction level remains important from a technical perspective. Any breakout for now would increase the probability of BTC prices floating to retest $73,800 or break higher. Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView In the days ahead, inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) coupled with improving sentiment might spark more demand. In that likelihood, BTC bulls will find the momentum to confirm the May 20 bar and break above the local resistance. Feature image from DALLE, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) did not have the spike in price many predicted after its halving event. History had told us BTC would reach an all-time high soon after the event but it is likely the all-time prices set earlier in the year distorted its chances. Bitcoin then lost a bit of its gains and started to hiver around the $60-$62k mark. Now Bitcoin has started to rally again and, at the time of writing, is above $66k. This has led experts to ponder, what is next for Bitcoin. In an interesting piece, one crypto writer provides data that suggest the bulls could push Bitcoin all the way to $90k which would be yet another all time high in 2024. While Bitcoin may be headed to new heights we think investing in these up-and-coming altcoins could see more explosive returns on investment. We found seven presale tokens we think have the unique properties necessary to explode during the next bull run. Here they are: Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE) Sealana ($SEAL) WienerAI($WAI) 99Bitcoins Token ($99BTC) 5thScape (5SCAPE) Sponge V2 ($SPONGEV2) Pikamoon (PIKA) Let’s take a look at each project and see why they are promising investments. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet The Best Crypto Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Dogeverse- The promising new Doge alternative that’s the first of its kind Readers who pay close attention to the presale market would have noticed more Dogecoin alternatives popping up. This is not a coincidence, Dogecoin (DOGE) has only made minuscule gains when compared to other meme coins during a period of explosive growth for the whole sector. Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE) could be the final nail in the coffin as its presale indicators DOGE investors are jumping ship. The Dogeverse presale began less than two months ago but has already raised well north of $15 million. This is not normal for a meme coin so it definitely indicates a changing of the tides. Dogeverse itself is also modeled around a pup meme but this dog is a space called Cosmo. He was born with the unique ability to jump from chain to chain. This makes Doegverse a multi-chain token and also the first project that will be available on six networks. Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, and BNB Smart Chain are the layer 1s, alongside Layer 2s such as Polygon and Base. Given Solana’s surprise rise past Ethereum as the most popular network with altcoin investors, this move by Dogeverse gives it versatility for the future. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Dogeverse Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sealana- This South Park-inspired meme coin looks like the real deal As you will see this list is very heavy on meme coins. The market is exploding and April saw an all-time high 138 new releases added to the sector. Solana has been the network that has stared during this expansion as a lot of the best performers come from its network. Hoping to be next up on this list is Sealana ($SEAL). We love the subtle nature of the meme behind Sealana as it’s a well-meaning dig at crypto enthusiasts based on an inaccurate stereotype. The character Sealana is based on is actually a gamer from the “Make Love Not War’ episode. The character keeps killing the boys characters in the game World of Warcraft. The joke is to be a player this strong you have to have no life and play the game 24/7. Sealana is a seal version of this character who is a patriot that is stuck in his mom’s basement trading crypto all day. We know meme coin lovers can take a joke and we think they will love Sealana. Rumors that the people behind Slerf Token (SLERF) are also involved with Sealana only strengthen our prediction that it will pump. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sealana Now\u003c\u003c\u003c WienerAI- The futuristic dog that is here to bring its investors massive gains One development the meme coin market has seen recently since its explosion in popularity is the merging of meme coins with other entities. One of the most popular is AI. The new technology has been coveted by the crypto market as many see it as a way to attract investors. WienerAI ($WAI) has taken a very interesting approach to incorporating AI into its project. Nearly every single other meme coin project has used AI to add utility in some way. WienerAI, however, wishes to go down the traditional meme coin route of the actual meme being the attraction. This means they wish to rely on virality so they have used AI to give its meme a background story. It begins in the year 2132 where we are transported to a place called New Silicon Valley. We find ourselves in a laboratory owned by a mad scientist who goes by the architect. Here he is devising an experiment that combines pups and AI. However, at the last second, he accidentally drops a sausage into the mix and we are left with WienerAI. We think this story will attract tons of investors. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy WienerAI Now\u003c\u003c\u003c 99Bitcoins Token- We can’t wait to see what this learn-to-earn platform has to offer One thing that investors should look out for when investing in a new project is industry knowledge. One example of this is when creators involved with one successful project start another. Another is what we have with 99Bitcoins Token ($99BTC). They run the biggest crypto learning platform on the market and now they have turned their attention to Web 3. They have sold over 2 million courses to crypto enthusiasts and have over 750k followers of their YouTube channel so there is a good chance a portion of you reading this have gained some valuable knowledge from them. The presale has so far raised over $1.3 million as investors seem to be excited to see what they will bring to the crypto market. How the learn-to-earn model works is investors will be able to learn $99BTC by passing through levels of the curriculum and by interacting with the community. What’s great about this is investors can learn more about the market while also earning crypto. $99BTc can be used to access premium content, purchase partner content, and of course trade on the market. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy 99Bitcoins token Now\u003c\u003c\u003c 5thScape- Get ready for a taste of the future with this VR token The crypto market prides itself on being ahead of the curve and that is exactly what 5thScape (5SCAPE) is doing with this project. They believe that the future of VR will be tokenized and they are hoping to lead the charge with this futuristic coin. If you purchase the 5SCAPE token you will have access to the best VR educational resources, the latest blockbuster movies, and of course the best VR video games. Although they do plan to release their own in-house VR goggles, the creators have made the current version compatible with other VR headsets already on the market like the Oculus. With presale tokens, the amount the project raises isn’t always indicative of how the listings will go but one that raises a lot during the presale period is still a great sign. The 5thScape presale is just about to hit the $6 million raised mark which is a clear indicator that investors are ready for the future of VR. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy 5thScape Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sponge V2- With a new P2E game added to the mix this V2 meme could be huge Sponge V2 ($SPONGEV2) is a meme coin we are very excited about. Who can blame us when you consider how successful version 1 Sponge Token ($SPONGE) was? The people behind the project have also come up with a very innovative way to go from one project to the other, a problem a lot of other projects have faced before. The process is called stake-to-bridge. Investors who wish to purchase the new $SPONGEV2, must first purchase and then stake the original $SPONGE. When they do so an equivalent amount of version 2 is purchased and stored away for them. Once the total allocation of version 1 is sold out then version 2 will launch and investors will receive their $SPONGEV2 along with their staking rewards. Sponge V2 will add an exciting P2E racing game to add utility to the ecosystem. Given how successful Sponge Token was this could make it huge. In 2023, Sponge Token was launched and soon became a cult hero. It pumped by hundreds of percent in a bearish market and eventually ended up on 10 exchanges. \u003e\u003eBuy Sponge V2 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Pikamoon- Another exciting meme coin/P2E combo we think will pump Pikamoon (PIKA) has chosen a route for its project we can fully get on board with. The meme coin/P2E crossover is always a good combination but taking inspiration from a traditional giant is the icing on the cake. The creators will be hoping to entice fans of Pokemon, one of the largest traditional gaming franchises of all time, to try this blockchain version. Players will be able to explore four different universes in the game which together are called the Pikaverse. They will do this alongside the NFT sidekick they mint at the beginning of the game. Players can earn PIKA in-game by completing challenges and battling other players. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet The Best Crypto Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Conclusion So, despite some ambitious Bitcoin forecasts we have decided to look elsewhere for coins that should explode during the next bull run. With a meme coin-heavy focus, all the projects contain unique qualities necessary to attract investors. We are confident all of them can provide a good ROI.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "James Coutts predicts a potential bullish turn for Bitcoin price in the near future, attributing it to the Global Money Supply.\n\n",
    "content": "In a recent analysis, James Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Realvision, signaled a potential bullish turn in Bitcoin’s near future, attributing the forecasted change to shifts in global liquidity measures, specifically the Global Money Supply (M2) index which is widely seen as most important price catalyst. Coutts detailed this anticipation in a thread on X, where he examined the relationship between major economic indicators and Bitcoin’s price cycles. Global Money Supply And Its Correlation With Bitcoin Coutts’ analysis begins with the M2 money aggregates, which consist of cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money. He tracks these aggregates across the 12 largest economies, all adjusted to USD. This measure, he suggests, is central to understanding liquidity flows within the global fiat, credit-based financial system. According to Coutts, “The money stock often moves in one direction, with significant drops like those seen in 2022 being rare and typically brief.” Related Reading Bitcoin Soaring Toward $84,000: Insights From Glassnode Co-Founders 6 days ago Currently, the Global M2 is neutral, but Coutts predicts imminent changes: “There is a sea of red across my macro \u0026 liquidity dashboard, but signs are emerging that this is about to change. Global M2 holds the key for the next leg of the cycle due to its high correlation with $BTC bull cycles.” The rate of change in M2 money supply is more critical than its nominal value. Coutts noted, “The chart confirms what our MSI performance table suggests: Bitcoin usually moves with shifts in M2 momentum.” He explained that despite the global money supply MSI indicator being in an uptrend, the momentum remains sluggish, maintaining a Neutral MSI. For a shift to a bullish MSI signal, an increase in momentum is necessary, requiring a combination of dollar depreciation, credit expansion, and increased government debt issuance. Coutts pointed out the crucial role of credit conditions, as evidenced by corporate bond spreads (BBB/Baa) compared to the US 10-year Treasury yield, which have historically aligned with significant inflections in Bitcoin’s cycle. “These spreads are currently narrowing, indicating that corporations are managing to issue and roll over debt despite the high interest rates resulting from the record hikes in 2022 and 2023,” he observed. Related Reading $291 Billion Asset Manager Founder Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $420,000 1 week ago Using the chameleon trend indicator on the corporate spread index, Coutts suggests a strategy: “Long Bitcoin when the index shows a bearish trend (red) and stay alert for potential trend reversals (turning green).” The Role Of the Dollar And Future Outlook A key to this cycle, according to Coutts, is the behavior of the DXY (Dollar Index), which measures the US dollar against a basket of foreign currencies. “The Dollar is range-bound. A break below 101 would be rocket fuel for Bitcoin,” he asserted, emphasizing that market sentiment on liquidity is often reflected in real-time by DXY movements. Coutts also touched upon the US debt situation, suggesting that without a conservative shift in Congress advocating for fiscal responsibility, more deficit spending is likely on the horizon, which could further influence liquidity conditions favorable to Bitcoin. Coutts concluded with a note of caution mixed with optimism: “While my framework needs 2/3 MSI indicators to turn Bullish for macro headwinds to turn into tailwinds, Bitcoin price action will probably sniff out this inflection in the macro before most indicators react.” His analysis suggests that if Bitcoin breaks above its all-time highs, it would be unwise to bet against it, anticipating potential climbs towards $150,000 in this cycle. “The DXY holds the key to the Bitcoin cycle as it prices in mkt expectations on liquidity in real time. And liquidity is coming. Watch the 101/102 level on DXY If that breaks, then we should see ~$150k btc this cycle,” he remarked. At press time, BTC traded at $66,090.

    "summary": "Renowned financial analyst John Bollinger has recently issued a caution regarding the potential for a Bitcoin pullback.\n\n",
    "content": "Renowned financial analyst John Bollinger has recently issued a caution regarding the potential for a Bitcoin pullback. After BTC price surged from below $66,000 to almost $72,000 at the beginning of the week, Bollinger, the creator of the widely utilized Bollinger Bands indicator, pointed to specific features in the Bitcoin price chart that suggest a consolidation or pullback could be imminent, though he clarified that his perspective was not bearish on a longer term. The Bearish Argument By John Bollinger Bollinger’s analysis focuses on the daily BTC/USD chart. His main concern centers around a “two-bar reversal” pattern observed at the upper Bollinger Band. This pattern, typically indicating a potential reversal in price direction, occurs when Bitcoin’s price first exceeds the upper Bollinger Band but then closes within it during the next trading period. Such movements can imply that the upward momentum might be losing strength. Bitcoin Bollinger Bands analysis | Source: X @bbands The Bollinger Bands on the chart consist of three lines: the lower band, the middle band (20-day simple moving average), and the upper band. These bands expand and contract based on price volatility, with the upper and lower bands set two standard deviations away from the middle band. The Bitcoin price peaked at approximately $71,977 on Tuesday, momentarily pushing above the upper Bollinger Band before closing back within it, forming the noted reversal pattern. Related Reading Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar To Highest Level In Months As BTC Price Surges Past $68,000 1 day ago Further analysis shows the 20-day moving average, the middle Bollinger Band, which currently sits at about $64,564 and acts as a potential support level in the event of a price decline. Historical data from the chart indicates crucial resistance near the recent highs around $71,500, while support levels could be seen around the $64,500 mark, where the middle Bollinger Band lies, and further at $58,300, coinciding with the lower band. The expansion of the Bollinger Bands indicates increased market volatility, particularly as the price tests resistance levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently just at 63, which is not yet in the overbought territory. In his commentary, Bollinger has clearly stated that while the setup is not fundamentally bearish, the observed technical pattern warrants caution for short-term traders. He advises monitoring for either a consolidation period where the price stabilizes, or a pullback where it retreats from recent highs. “I am not fond of the two-bar reversal at the upper Bollinger Band for BTCUSD. Suggests a consolidation or a pullback. Not bearish here, just short-term concerned,” Bollinger remarked. The Bullish Argument On the contrary, renowned crypto analyst, Josh Olszewicz (@CarpeNoctom), shared a bullish outlook on Bitcoin through a different lens, focusing on the Ichimoku Cloud indicator in the daily chart. He highlighted a “Bullish TK Cross with Price Above Cloud” on the daily Bitcoin chart. Related Reading Analyst Says $71,000 Bitcoin Move Is Only Halfway Through, Here’s Why 22 hours ago This particular pattern is significant within the realm of technical analysis, especially for those employing the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator, a comprehensive tool that provides insights into market momentum, trend direction, and support and resistance levels. The “Bullish TK Cross” Olszewicz refers to occurs when the Tenkan-sen line (a short-term moving average) crosses above the Kijun-sen line (a medium-term moving average), indicating a potential uptrend. Typically, this crossover suggests that buying momentum is increasing and can signal the start of a bullish phase. Bitcoin price, 1-day chart | Source: X @CarpeNoctom The significance of this bullish signal is further enhanced by the fact that the price of Bitcoin is above the “Cloud” or ‘Kumo’, which is considered an area of future support or resistance. When the price is above the cloud, it’s generally viewed as a bullish signal, suggesting that the asset is in a strong uptrend and likely to continue as such. This setup provides a clear bullish scenario that contrasts with the short-term caution suggested by John Bollinger’s analysis. At press time, BTC traded at $69,846.

    "summary": "Bitcoin may soon experience another price rally following an increase in the supply of a specific stablecoin.\n\n",
    "content": "According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin rose by 2.9% on Friday to trade above $67,000 for the first time since April 24. This positive price performance by the maiden cryptocurrency has been attributed to the low inflation levels reported in the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. However, Bitcoin is an asset subject to the influence of several forces. According to a report by blockchain analysis platform LookonChain, BTC may soon experience another price rally following an increase in the supply of a specific stablecoin. Related Reading: Unstoppable Bitcoin? CryptoQuant’s CEO Foresees Bull Run Extending To 2025 Can USDT Replicate Surging Effect On Bitcoin? In an X post on Friday, LookonChain reported that the Tether Treasury has minted an additional 1 billion USDT indicating a consistent rising demand for the stablecoin. USDT which ranks as the third largest cryptocurrency doubles as the most dominant stablecoin in the crypto space with a market cap value of $111.25 billion. The USDT token has famously recorded much growth in the last year with over 31 billion new tokens minted on the Tron and Ethereum network. Interestingly, LookonChain reveals that this rise in USDT market share contributed significantly to Bitcoin’s ascent from $27,000 to $73,000 in the past fifteen months. The theory behind this relationship stems from an increase in traders’ liquidity provided by investments in USDT. This increased market liquidity can alter the status of Bitcoin’s supply and demand and oftentimes lead to a rise in BTC’s price. Following the most recent 1 billion USDT minted by the Tether Treasury, most investors and spectators could be expecting a similar boosting effect on Bitcoin’s price, especially with the crypto bull season in play. However, Bitcoin’s price in the coming months is still likely to be influenced by other factors such as the BTC spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. According to data from SoSoValue, net inflows on Friday reached $177.01 million bringing the total value of the Bitcoin spot ETF market to $12.58 billion. As more major traditional finance players gain a piece of this novel market, Bitcoin is expected to experience monumental levels of demand which will translate into weighty price gains.

The coin is retesting $66,000 at spot rates, but traders expect the breakout to have been confirmed, pushing BTC prices toward $70,000. Since the surge to all-time highs in March, the coin has been on a steady downtrend, as shown in the formation on the daily chart.

The Bitcoin liquidity cycle is simply a chart showing the boom and bust periods of the world’s most valuable coin. Every cycle in history is highly influenced by the availability and flow of capital in and out of the asset. The analyst is upbeat, arguing that though prices are down from all-time highs and appear stuck in a consolidation, the coin is still in a “warm-up” phase. Woo adds that the current consolidation period means the long-term risk is low in light of the relatively high liquidity.

The realized cap is a metric that aims to gauge the total value of all coins in circulation based on the price at which they were last moved.

    "content": "After enduring a significant 20% price correction earlier this month that saw Bitcoin fall below $56,400 and increased outflows from the Bitcoin ETF market, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has managed to stage a strong comeback. It has broken above the key $66,000 resistance level and turned it into a new support zone. BTC Bounces Back As Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar The resurgence in Bitcoin’s price has been closely tied to a rekindling of inflows into the US spot Bitcoin ETF market. Data from Farside shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their best inflow week in two months, with the US fund category collectively notching $948 million in positive net flows from May 13 to May 17. Interestingly, the majority of these inflows, approximately 89%, occurred in the last three trading days of the week, which industry analysts and researchers such as James Butterfill of CoinShares attribute to a shift in investor sentiment following the release of a lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Wednesday. Butterfill stated: The inflows were an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report, highlighting our view that Bitcoin prices have recoupled to interest rate expectations.

Notably, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has seen outflows of $16.6 billion since the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF in January, saw small inflows totaling $18 million. Beyond just spot Bitcoin ETFs, the digital asset investment product space experienced inflows for the second consecutive week, totaling $932 million, according to CoinShares. However, trading volumes remained relatively low at $10.5 billion, compared to the $40 billion seen in March. Bitcoin Poised For Further Gains? The renewed institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and the broader digital asset space has coincided with a strong price recovery for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s ability to firmly hold the $66,250 support level, with over 530,000 BTC traded at this price, has given analysts confidence in the asset’s potential for further gains. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, if the $66,000 support holds, Bitcoin could see strong potential for further gains in the coming days, demonstrating the bullish sentiment surrounding the largest cryptocurrency on the market. However, while Bitcoin has managed to bounce back above the crucial $66,000 level after the recent pullback, the leading cryptocurrency still faces a critical test as it attempts to break out of its established trading range.

The analyst further explains that Bitcoin has been oscillating between its low and high range between $60,000 and $70,000 for over two months, a natural consolidation process. As part of this, Rekt Capital believes that Bitcoin should be able to revisit the range high of $71,500 over time. The daily chart shows that BTC’s price is trending upward.

    "content": "The development of Web3 ecosystems is a significant milestone in the digital domain. They use decentralized and blockchain-based solutions that can transform several industries. These ecosystems aim to modify our approach to managing digital assets, data, and transactions, transforming online interactions as we now understand them. While there is widespread excitement about Web3, it is crucial to remember that mere popularity does not guarantee sustained success. Several platforms have had challenges sustaining their progress due to a deficiency in ongoing community engagement and expansion. Essential Elements of a Strong Community The main support mechanism of a robust Web3 ecosystem is its capacity to attract and retain developers. These ecosystems’ applications, innovations, and structures are mostly the developers’ work. Three main criteria drive their engagement: security, speed, and pricing. Developers seek platforms that provide economical solutions to optimize their spending and manage resources effectively. Additionally significant is speed since developers must quickly offer applications and transactions to stay competitive in rapidly changing markets. Similar importance is attached to security; developers want tight guidelines and protections to keep their data and assets secure from threats. Web3 platforms hoping to establish a vibrant developer community must adhere to the 80/20 rule. This concept holds that creating an environment that fully satisfies developer needs should receive 80% of the work. Platforms that stress building safe, efficient, and reasonably priced infrastructure may provide a solid foundation for developer participation and innovation. Nonetheless, the remaining 20% of funds must be allocated to outreach and incentive initiatives. Although a good environment attracts developers, intentional outreach and incentive schemes are needed to boost community growth and maintain involvement. Platforms may effectively include developers through clever partnerships, targeted marketing campaigns, and special incentive plans, creating a vibrant ecosystem driven by collaboration and creativity. Proactive Outreach and Incentive Programs Prom, a Layer 2 solution aimed at improving interoperability across multiple blockchain networks, including EVM and non-EVM compatible chains, is one platform that uses incentive programs. It sends transaction proofs to additional chains on the selected Settlement chain, boosting connections across ecosystems. Prom, powered by Polygon, reduces transaction costs using zkSNARKs technology, making it a low-cost blockchain solution. It also uses Polygon Zero and powerful recursive STARK technology for quick transactions and scalable dApp development, which appeals to both developers and consumers. Furthermore, Prom’s EVM-equivalent design facilitates integration with the current Ethereum infrastructure, simplifying development and lowering costs. Prom emphasizes aggressive marketing and comprehensive incentive schemes to increase network participation and foster a dynamic community. It works with teams and products that are vital to the expansion of the ecosystem, as well as providing grants and assistance to projects that contribute to Prom’s development. Prom’s incentive scheme includes a referral program that pays users $PROM tokens to introduce friends and expand its user base. In addition, Prom provides fee kickback rates ranging from 10% to 50% to encourage community members to actively participate in the referral program. Creating the Ideal Environment for Developers To build a favorable environment for developers in Web3 ecosystems, platforms must solve their primary concerns: price, speed, and security. They should strive to create cost-effective solutions that enable developers to effectively manage resources and maximize the value of their investments. Speed is also important since developers must launch applications quickly and interface with blockchain networks smoothly to remain competitive. Strong security measures are also required to safeguard developers’ assets and data from attacks while increasing confidence in the platform. Successful systems that focus on developer demands provide useful examples. They have incorporated novel methods to increase price, speed, and security, creating a community where developers can interact and contribute. Partnerships, infrastructure optimization, and support campaigns have made these platforms ideal for developers seeking to construct and deploy decentralized apps. However, establishing the best atmosphere for developers is a continuous effort. Platforms must be adaptive, always monitoring and adapting to changes in developer expectations and market trends. Platforms that respond to feedback may improve their products to better suit developers’ changing demands. This continual adaption is critical for being competitive and relevant in the ever-changing Web3 scene, as it ensures that platforms remain appealing and useful to developers looking to cooperate and create within decentralized ecosystems. Potential Challenges Building strong and long-lasting communities on Web3 platforms isn’t without its challenges. Maintaining relevance in continual technological and business upheavals is a major challenge. Platforms also struggle with the harmony between decentralization and governance to include the community while preserving direction. Platforms try to welcome individuals from all origins and points of view; hence, it might be difficult to guarantee diversity and inclusion in the community. The long-term sustainability of Web3 platforms relies on their use of focused operations and strategic approaches. It takes open and honest channels of communication that promote trust and collaboration for platforms to deal with problems and seek guidance. Those who can access educational resources and support services could become more active and transform their communities. If we want to create a warm environment where everyone feels valued, diversity and inclusion programs must be encouraged. Platforms should also prioritize scalability and interoperability in order to collaborate with other networks and adjust to the community’s evolving requirements. By making partnerships and funding strong technological infrastructure, platforms could overcome large-scale challenges and promote innovation. Using decentralized governance techniques, community members may acquire agency and guarantee that decisions are made openly and advantageously. Conclusion Building a strong Web3 group takes a lot of time, work, and money. It’s more important to be proactive and thoughtful than to be famous for a short time. To be successful in the difficult Web3 environment over the long term, platforms must focus on community-building projects. By investing in involvement and partnerships and adapting to changing needs, platforms can build strong communities that encourage working together and creativity. I want platforms to take action and focus on building active and welcoming communities. This will set the stage for future growth and development in the Web3 environment.\n\n",

Although momentum appears to be picking up, bulls are not out of the woods just yet. Analysts are not losing hope and remain overly upbeat, expecting a surge that would take the world’s most valuable coin to new levels. Bitcoin Forms A “Cup And Handle” Formation In The Weekly Chart In a post on X, one of them, MikybullCrypto, said Bitcoin has formed a “cup and handle” reversal pattern, suggesting an imminent surge towards new all-time highs. This formation is a glimmer of hope for optimistic traders, especially now that prices have been moving lower and sideways, erasing gains posted in March. BTC forms a cup and handle pattern | Source: @MikybullCrypto via X The “cup and handle” formation is a technical pattern chartists use to identify potential reversals and confirm trend continuations. In the current setup, as identified by the trader on the weekly chart, the “handle” was formed after the recent price drop from all-time highs. The “cup” follows the price decline in 2022 and the subsequent recovery in 2023. Related Reading Crypto Analyst Shares Top AI Altcoin Investments This Month 1 week ago Historically, if there is a breakout above the handle and the rim of the cup, prices tend to rally to new levels.

A breakout, reading from the candlestick formation in the daily chart, above these liquidation levels could spark demand, lifting the coin to new levels. Will Miners Dump BTC And Force Prices Lower? However, lurking beneath the optimistic outlook is a potential storm cloud: declining on-chain activity. After the brief spike in on-chain activity on Halving Day due to the launch of the Runes protocol, transaction fees have been declining. According to YCharts, it is currently at $3.206, down from over $128 on April 20. This contraction means miners are getting less revenue, heaping more pressure now that there is more pressure on margins post-Halving. Related Reading XRP To Nearly $600?

    "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons have recently gone through a crossover. Here’s what it could mean for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Suggest Miner Capitulation Is On As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a Quicktake post, miners are capitulating right now if the Hash Ribbons indicator is to be believed. This on-chain metric is generally used to determine whether miners are in distress. BTC runs on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism where miners play the role of validators and compete against each other using computing power to get a chance to add the next block to the chain. This computing power, when measured across the network, can provide insight into the health of the miners as a whole. Due to this reason, the Hash Ribbons indicator makes use of this total Bitcoin “Hashrate” to judge the situation of the miners. Related Reading Bitcoin Price Linked To Binance Vs Coinbase Battle, Quant Reveals 1 week ago Naturally, a rise in the Hashrate suggests the network is attracting miners right now, while a decline could imply low profitability is making some of these validators pull out from BTC. The Hash Ribbons indicator uses two moving averages (MA) of the Hashrate, 30-day and 60-day, to represent whether these behaviors are particularly intense or not at the moment. When the 30-day ribbon moves under the 60-day one, it suggests that miners are mass capitulating. On the other hand, the opposite cross suggests network is observing growth again. Now, what relevance do these trends have for Bitcoin? According to Charles Edwards, the creator of the Hash Ribbons, the miners have historically been quite resilient, and they only quit when things get especially bad for the cryptocurrency. As such, the market may be more likely to approach a bottom whenever these chain validators show capitulation. Below is a chart that shows how the miners’ behaviour has looked recently according to this indicator: Looks like the two ribbons have gone through a cross recently | Source: CryptoQuant As Maartunn has highlighted in the graph, the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons have seen a crossover recently. More specifically, the cross has involved the 30-day moving under the 60-day, implying that the miners are capitulating. Miner profits come down to three factors: BTC spot price, transaction fees, and electricity costs in the area that they are located in. Historically, the fees has been quite low in comparison to the block rewards, so miner financials have been dependent on the price (as the block rewards only have this variable attached to them) and electricity prices. Recently, the BTC price has been stuck in consolidation while the block rewards have been slashed in half in the latest Halving event. This has led to tightening revenues for these chain validators, so it’s not surprising to see that the miners with the least efficient machines have already started ditching the network in hordes.

It’s visible that while miner capitulation has generally indeed occurred near profitable buying points into the asset, these bottoms haven’t immediately appeared after the crossovers have occurred. As the analyst notes, “It unfolds in the subsequent days and weeks after less efficient miners throw in the towel.” BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to move overall flat over the past week as its price is still trading around $62,700.

    "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross still has a high value, a sign that may be bearish for BTC. Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Is Still Near Historical Top Zone In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the recent trend in the NVT Golden Cross for BTC and its implications for the price. The NVT ratio is an indicator that tells us about how the Bitcoin market cap compares against its transaction volume. The metric is generally used to judge whether the asset’s price is fair or not right now. Related Reading Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Form Capitulation Signal: What It Means 1 week ago When the indicator’s value is high, it suggests the network’s value (that is, the market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins (the volume). Such a trend implies that the asset may be overpriced currently. On the other hand, the low metric means the cryptocurrency’s price may be undervalued due to a rebound as the market cap is low compared to the volume. In the context of the current topic, the NVT ratio itself isn’t of interest; rather, it is a modified form called the NVT Golden Cross. This metric compares the short-term trend (the 10-day moving average) with the long-term trend (30-day MA) of the NVT ratio to identify tops and bottoms. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this Bitcoin indicator over the past couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have been relatively high in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant In the graph, the quant has highlighted the two relevant zones for the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross. It would appear that when this metric is above 2.2, a top can be probable for the cryptocurrency as its price is overvalued in this zone. Similarly, the NVT Golden Cross being under -1.6 can lead to a bottom formation for the asset. The Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has ventured into the red territory for the last couple of months. Each time it has seen a decline out of the zone, it has followed up with another rise into the zone. As such, it hasn’t been able to visit the bullish region yet. At present, the metric has just made another exit out of the top zone, but its value is still quite near it. Thus, while a top may not be especially probable now, a lasting uptrend is also unlikely to happen. Related Reading Bitcoin Price Linked To Binance Vs Coinbase Battle, Quant Reveals 1 week ago It’s possible that Bitcoin won’t be completely out of danger of observing more price drawdowns until the NVT Golden Cross can see a decrease in the green zone.

Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator Could Imply Potential For Further Upside In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo discussed what the latest trend in the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator for BTC might suggest regarding what could be next for the cryptocurrency. The VWAP is an indicator that calculates the average price for any asset by taking into account the price fluctuations themselves and weighing the values against the trading volume. Related Reading XRP \u0026 Cardano Whales Load Up Bags: Preparation For Altcoin Rally? 5 days ago This means that the prices of the assets where there was a higher volume of trading have a higher weightage in the average than those with only a low amount of volume. Traditionally, the VWAP is a technical analysis indicator that considers the information available through spot exchanges. In the context of the current topic, the VWAP uses the on-chain volume of Bitcoin instead, which is readily viewable by anyone thanks to the blockchain’s transparency. The indicator of interest here isn’t the VWAP but rather the VWAP Oscillator, as mentioned earlier. This metric keeps track of the ratio between the BTC spot price and the VWAP and presents it as an oscillator of around zero. The chart below shows the trend of this Bitcoin indicator over the past couple of years. The value of the metric appears to have been negative in recent weeks | Source: @woonomic on X The above graph shows that the Bitcoin VWAP Oscillator has been in negative territory for the past couple of months. However, the metric’s value has been rising recently, so if it continues on this trajectory, it might approach the neutral mark shortly. In the chart, Woo has highlighted a trend that the indicator and the cryptocurrency’s price have historically shown. It seems that whenever the metric has formed a bottom in negative territory and rebounded back to the upside, the asset has enjoyed some bullish momentum. The resulting price surge may last until the indicator reverses into the positive territory and forms a top.

Short-Term Holder Bitcoin Whales Have Continued To Accumulate Recently As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the demand among the short-term holder whales has decreased since the all-time high, although it still continues to remain strong. Related Reading Buy Or Sell Bitcoin? Quant Reveals What Leading Metric Says 1 week ago The “short-term holders” (STHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. This cohort includes the new investors in the market, as well as the fickle-minded traders who make moves often and don’t tend to HODL. The investors who make it past the 155-day threshold are put inside the “long-term holders” (LTHs), which is a group that’s generally considered to reflect the resolute side of the sector. In the context of the current discussion, the investors of interest aren’t the ordinary STHs, but rather the humongous entities called whales. Formally, these investors are defined as those holding more than 1,000 BTC in their wallets. At the current exchange rate, this lower limit is worth $61.5 million, which is massive indeed. Whales can be influential beings on the network because of these large holdings, so their behavior can be something worth keeping an eye on. The STH whales would naturally correspond to the large holders who only bought within the past five months. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the exchange outflows being made by these new whales in the Bitcoin market over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been sharply going down in recent weeks | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin STH whale exchange outflows had spiked to pretty high levels earlier in the year, when the rally towards the new all-time high (ATH) price had taken place. Naturally, this spike would suggest demand for buying the cryptocurrency was high from new whale investors entering the space. At the peak, the indicator implied accumulation was occurring at the rate of a whopping 452,000 BTC per week. Related Reading Bitcoin Will Be Set For New ATHs If It Breaks This Resistance: Analyst 1 week ago A part of this buying would correspond to the demand coming in from the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – new investment vehicles for Bitcoin only approved at the start of this year that provide for an indirect way to invest into the asset in a format that may be preferrable for the more traditional investors. From the chart, it’s visible that the demand from the new whales has seen a clear decline in the period since the ATH, but accumulation nonetheless remains substantial as the STH whales are still potentially buying at a rate of around 200,000 BTC per week.

Bitcoin Rally Getting Started: Analyst Taking to X, Woo, who has been maintaining a bullish outlook for the world’s most valuable coin, boldly asserts that the current Bitcoin rally is only halfway through its welcomed bullish journey. Sharing a chart, the on-chain analyst notes that the Bitcoin VWAP oscillator just bottomed up from oversold territory and is now at the zero mark, which is midway. Though Woo is upbeat and expecting even more gains, the analyst didn’t specify when or at what level prices will peak.

Woo says this consolidation might allow users to accumulate before a “second leg” propels the Bitcoin to new heights. Looking at the Bitcoin daily chart, this “second leg” is expected to be a breakout moment that will lift the coin above March highs. Bitcoin prices trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView At press time, Bitcoin is still in a bullish formation. The uptick above $68,000 and last week’s high were crucial for trend definition. Moreover, since the May 20 breakout bar is wide-ranging and has a high trading volume, the odds of trend continuation are high. If bulls follow through, confirming May 20 gains, BTC will likely break $73,800, aligning with Woo’s forecast. BTC Bull Run To Last 300 Days If There Is No Black Swan Event Besides Woo, another analyst says the Bitcoin uptrend is in full swing. Sharing a chart, the trader said that barring any unforeseen disruptions, such as the impact of a major exchange going bankrupt, it is highly likely that the current bull run will extend for another 300 days. Bitcoin uptrend is in full swing | Source: @AxelAdlerJr via X This prediction is based on profit and loss analysis of short-term holders (STHs) with a 90-day moving average. Currently, the STH is moving lower but is relatively higher. Analysts use the STH to determine market sentiment from short-term price movements and trader speculations.

Besides the impact of the United States Federal Reserve and their monetary policy declaration, inflow to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will be crucial. After a lull, demand is picking up, helping to propel bulls. Feature image from DALLE, chart from TradingView\n\n",

    "content": "Crypto whales are making moves following the recent bear market. With Bitcoin increasing to $66,000, experts believe several projects could see significant rallies over the next few weeks. Three projects that have already caught whale attention are Chainlink, Rollblock, and Binance Coin (BNB). With all projects already in the green, experts believe they could see significant rallies, with Rollblock poised for returns of over 720%. Chainlink Passes 100% Annual Returns Chainlink’s impressive performance has continued in Q2, taking the altcoin’s annual returns to 107%. This milestone has triggered an influx of new investors, and Chainlink’s daily trading volume is up by 25.95% over the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, Chainlink was trading at $13.82 and boasted a market cap of $8.1 Billion. Since its launch in 2017, Chainlink has showcased exceptional growth, outperforming many of the market’s top cryptocurrencies. Following its recent rally, experts believe that Chainlink could pass $20 in 2024. As a result, crypto whales are doubling down on Chainlink (LINK) tokens to optimize their portfolios. Binance Successfully Implements New Security Protocol Binance recently implemented an “antidote” to the growing problem of address poisoning. This is when an investor is tricked into sending funds to a fraudulent address. This new algorithm has already been a huge success and has identified over 13.4 million spoofed addresses. This is a huge boost to the Binance Coin ecosystem. Given that crypto scams are on the rise, this development brings a much-needed sense of security to Binance Coin and the Binance Smart Chain. Since this update, Binance Coin’s price has increased by 2.29%, and Binance Coin (BNB) is now trading at $580.85. Having already experienced a strong performance in 2024, experts believe that Binance Coin (BNB) could be one of the market’s top cryptos in May. But how does Binance Coin compare to Rollblock? Why Are Crypto Whales Flocking to Rollblock? Rollblock is attracting cryptocurrency whales with its GambleFi protocol. This innovative project is one of the first to apply blockchain technology to the gambling industry, and its impact could be pivotal. By using blockchain technology, Rollblock is able to solve major industry issues such as transparency and security. Rollblock has already launched its casino, which showcases over 150 different games. The platform is fully licensed and will also introduce sports betting options over the next few months. These will cover major sports, including MMA, golf, boxing, soccer, and the NFL. One reason whales are buying Rollblock is its revenue share opportunity. Rollblock will share up to 30% of its daily revenue with $RBLK token holders. It will do this by using revenue to buy back $RBLK tokens on the open market, burning half of the tokens it buys. The remaining half will be used for staking rewards, offering some of the most lucrative passive income opportunities in the crypto market. This could become a great way for investors to build passive income streams and has been a key factor in Rollblock’s rapid growth. Currently in stage 2 of its presale, investors can buy $RBLK tokens for just $0.012. Experts believe tokens could increase in value by 720% during the Rollblock presale, and as a result, tokens are in high demand. Crypto Whales Take Advantage of Rollblock Returns Rollblock has a long-term roadmap in place, with big plans to pioneer developments in the gambling industry. With little competition, experts believe that Rollblock could quickly become one of the world’s top cryptocurrencies. With the price of RBLK expected to increase up to 880% in the presale alone, many investors are choosing to buy early to maximize their returns.

    "content": "Analysts from leading international cross-border bank, Standard Chartered have made a bold prediction that Bitcoin could witness a significant rise to new all-time highs above $73,700. This projection, slightly higher than the cryptocurrency’s previous peak, comes with an unexpected and wholly ambitious timeline. Bitcoin Poised To Reach New All-Time Highs Geoff Kendrick, Head of EM FX Research, West and Crypto Research, Standard Chartered, has made a bullish prediction for Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. In an email to TheBlock, Kendrick stated that Bitcoin is poised to break out of its previous all-time high on March 14, 2024, to witness a massive surge to approximately $73,798. Related Reading Crypto Market Liquidations Top $330 Million In 24 Hours With Ethereum In The Lead 1 day ago The analyst has projected a rather grandiose timeline for this bullish rally, expecting Bitcoin to hit the forecasted price target by the weekend. Kendrick attributed this potential price increase to the recent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Earlier on May 21, data from Farside investors indicated that Spot Bitcoin ETFs had recorded their best inflow week in the last two months. The digital asset saw over $305.7 million in inflows, with BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), amassing the largest inflows of $290 million. Cumulatively, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded inflows of more than $13 billion from its launch on January 11 to the present. This increased demand and influx of capital which had been a major contributor to Bitcoin’s previous rise to a new all-time high in March, could propel fresh surges for the cryptocurrency. Kendrick has also disclosed that the possible approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could have a significant impact on Bitcoin’s price dynamics. The analyst has doubled down on his previous price prediction which anticipates Bitcoin’s rise to $150,000 by the end of 2024 and a whopping $200,000 increase in 2025. BTC Price Analysis As of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $70,013, reflecting a slight decline of 1.39% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady bullish momentum over the past week, experiencing consistent price surges, which have led to a sharp increase of 12.86%. Related Reading Solana Cup And Handle Pattern Means An At Least 90% Move Against Ethereum, Analyst Says 21 hours ago Popular crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe has reported that Bitcoin is up more than 20% since its previous lows of $56,000 earlier this year. The approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF could see the cryptocurrency’s price potentially rising more, following previous patterns when the SEC’s approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs triggered a major price spike for the pioneer cryptocurrency. This sentiment for a bullish breakout is shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who has asserted that Bitcoin is currently showing a strong potential for further gains, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s robust price potential and strong fundamentals.

    "content": "An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could be positioned for new all-time highs (ATHs) if it can break through this on-chain resistance level. Bitcoin On-Chain Data Could Suggest This Level Holds Major Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed Bitcoin’s current on-chain resistance. In on-chain analysis, the strength of support and resistance levels is based on the total amount of cryptocurrency last acquired at each level. Below is a chart for Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric, which shows the supply distribution across the various price levels based on where the investors bought their coins. How the cost basis distribution in the BTC market looks like at the moment | Source: @ali_charts on X From the graph, it’s visible that in terms of the levels currently ahead of the spot price, the $66,250 mark stands out as it hosts the cost basis of over 2% of all Bitcoin UTXOs. Generally, the cost basis is a special level for any investor, and they are naturally more likely to react when it is retested, as it can lead to a flip in their profit-loss situation. The spot price retesting a level won’t produce much reaction if only a few investors share their cost basis around the level. Still, if many holders bought there, the cryptocurrency could see visible effects upon a retest. Investors who are losing money may look forward to such a retest to exit out at their break-even point, as they may fear that the asset will fall back down again in the future, so getting away with their initial capital would seem like the ideal decision. As such, a retest of a level dense with UTXOs from below can lead to a selling reaction in the market, making these levels points of strong resistance for Bitcoin. Since the $66,250 level appears to be where the most coins were purchased out of the levels ahead, this level could be the toughest one to break for the cryptocurrency. On the brighter side, though, the levels after this point are relatively thin. “Once BTC breaks past this level, it will be positioned for new all-time highs!” explains the analyst. The market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has also discussed about on-chain cost basis distribution in an X post today. As revealed by the firm, around 10% of all addresses acquired their coins between the current spot price and the all-time high the asset set back in March. Looks like a large amount of supply was purchased at the levels near the ATH | Source: IntoTheBlock on X This would naturally mean that 10% of the total addresses, equivalent to 5.16 million, are in the red on the Bitcoin network. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to move in its recent range, with its price currently trading around the $62,800 level.

    "content": "While top DeFi token, Solana, continues to recover in the broader market, SOL bulls are reeling with optimism, with many expecting the token to reach $200. Meanwhile, Rollblock (RBLK) has sparked excitement among traders and crypto enthusiasts after the announcement of its unique revenue-sharing model. Rollblock’s (RBLK) New Revenue-Sharing Sparks Excitement Among Traders Rollblock’s emergence into the cryptocurrency market has sparked interest among traders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Currently, in its presale’s second stage, Rollblock (RBLK) has demonstrated enormous potential, promising users and buyers incredible returns. Its ecosystem presents a roadmap unlike no other, gearing to change the narrative in the casino world. Unlike its traditional rivals, Rollblock offers a smooth sign-up process, prioritizing user privacy and convenience in today’s digital world. In addition, its incorporation of cryptocurrency as well as seamless onboarding process draws diverse users across the crypto market, especially with no need for KYC verification or extra downloads. Furthermore, Rollblock introduces a unique revenue-sharing model that could potentially change the dynamics in the GameFi market. While trying to repurchase $RBLK tokens from the open market, the Rollblock network sets aside up to 30% of its weekly revenue to achieve this. Furthermore, Rollblock’s token-burn feature ensures that 50% of repurchased tokens are removed from the market, while the other half goes to staking rewards. Meanwhile, the native RBLK token currently trades for $0.012 per token, which reflects 20% increase from an initial offering price of $0.01 as well as heightened buyer interes. As it awaits its listing on a major crypto exchange, market experts are touting Rollblock to soar to the top, making it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy this year. Solana Bulls Highly Optimistic With $200 Projection One of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the market, Solana (SOL) has proven time and again to be a formidable player in the crypto space. Notably, Solana is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to resolve scalability concerns in the crypto market by introducing proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism. Besides its unique features, Solana has also demonstrated exceptional strength in the broader DeFi market. In the last year, Solana has surged over 760%, demonstrating its resilience despite the bear market. Currently trading at a weekly price range between $146.8 and $178.6, SOL token has shown signs of recovery with analysts projecting a resurgence for the token. Furthermore, Solana network’s success can be partly attributed to emergence of meme coins on the Solana blockchain. With tokens like Dogwifhat and Bonk taking centerstage, there has been a growing interest in the Solana network as a whole. Moreso, while this has spurred optimism, analysts are projecting Solana to soar and reach the $200 mark very soon. With its current mass adoption and growing market cap, Solana maintains a solid spot among top Defi tokens in the crypto market. Can Rollblock Become As Successful As Solana in the Altcoin Market? Rollblock’s ascent in the crypto market has been quite commendable, with the token exploding into the scene without much hassle. This is a result of its innovative features and distinct roadmap which give it an edge over other new tokens. With its current trajectory, market experts are touting it to mirror and surpass some of the top DeFi tokens in the market.\n\n",

    "summary": "The global crypto adoption rate remains unsatisfactory and efforts are on to bring more people into web3. In this session, we’re interviewing Herbert Sim,\n\n",
    "content": "The global crypto adoption rate remains unsatisfactory and efforts are on to bring more people into web3. In this session, we’re interviewing Herbert Sim, COO of the digital asset trading platform, Websea, where he shares his insights about web3 adoption. Q. Hello. Would you please introduce yourself and share your professional journey with our readers? Hi, I’m Herbert and it’s wonderful to be here. I’m currently the COO of Websea, a youth-focused web3 digital asset trading platform. Before Websea, I worked as the Global Operations Director at Huobi Global and Chief Marketing Officer at Cryptology Exchange. So I’ve been in operational management in the FinTech sector for a fairly long time. Most people know me as ‘The Bitcoin Man’ for my work as an angel investor and advisor for crypto projects. The Bitcoin Man is now a venture capital fund where I continue to invest and incubate promising startups. I’m also the founder of Crypto Chain University (CCU), a non-profit institute and digital repository for blockchain research and policy-oriented work. CCU is a passion project and comes from my desire to make web3 accessible to people. I believe the web3 sector has much to do to bring decentralized protocols to the masses. So I continue to work hard to realize the vision of ‘onboarding the next billion’ to crypto. Q. Why do you think the web3 industry hasn’t yet reached mass crypto adoption? What does the industry need to do to bring more people into web3? In my opinion, the biggest problem is the lack of easy-to-use, smooth, and efficient web3 protocols with an engaging user interface. We can’t expect newcomers to navigate complicated apps to store or use digital assets daily. So web2 users need a seamless transition to web3 protocols where they don’t require any technical knowledge to operate the apps. Moreover, web3 apps must integrate attractive features and financial incentives to appeal to first-time users. For instance, crypto exchanges function as the main gateway to enter web3 for investing and trading in crypto and NFTs. These exchanges serve as the primary circulation hubs for the digital asset economy to transact globally without any restrictions. However, most crypto exchanges have a difficult user interface that doesn’t appeal to new users. Thus we need more exchanges that can conveniently provide digital asset services and remain integrated with the wider web3 economy. Once we have engaging web3 protocols, people from diverse demographics will start joining the crypto world. Q. Who do you think will be the primary driver of crypto adoption in the next decade? Can you elaborate on the reasons? I think the digital asset economy is conducive for people of all age groups and across geographical borders. If you look at statistical reports, there has been an almost 200% growth in global crypto users with Asian and African countries dominating the Crypto Adoption Index. But once you probe further, you’ll see that young people are the main drivers in the crypto space and will continue to do so. A Coinbase report states that 31% of young people own crypto compared to just 12% of older people. Further, 38% of youth believe that crypto is the future of finance compared to 28% of the older generation. There are multiple reasons why Millennials and Gen Z prefer crypto assets. To begin with, they’re digital natives who organically grew up with the Internet. But other socio-economic factors are working as well. Millennials have faced student debts, rising housing costs, inflation, and the 2008 financial crisis. Thus, rather than trusting centralized banks or government-backed national currencies, they’re more open to alternative finance like crypto. The Great Wealth Transfer will happen over the next few decades where Millennials and Gen Z will inherit around $84 trillion. A Galaxy Research report states that $160-$225 billion would come into crypto markets from younger generations if the Wealth Transfer happened today. When the Transfer is complete by 2045, crypto can record a daily incremental buying pressure of around $20-$28 million. That is why I’m building Websea, a digital asset ecosystem that specifically focuses on young investors. Q. Tell us more about Websea. How do you intend to cater to a young audience with your platform? Websea is a digital asset trading platform exclusively customized for the global youth. Our platform offers a dual account system with centralized and decentralized asset custody models. We have an integrated AI system for risk mitigation, fraud prevention, predictive trading analytics, and strategy recommendations. The WBS token powers our Websea platform. WBS has a total supply of 300 million tokens with 60% allocated for community incentives. The rest is for long-term platform development with a multi-year lock-up period. We follow an X-To-Earn tokenomics model where users can play, trade, browse, stake, contribute, and create to earn tokens. To answer your second question, Websea offers gamified features for an engaging and entertaining trading experience for our young audience. We also have options like Boost to Bargain, Invitation Red Packet rewards, Lucky Box awards, and Group Boosts. These financial incentives help us consolidate our platform and organically expand our user base. Websea is also focussing on building a gaming ecosystem to cater to the youth and will incubate GameFi projects. Q. We’re currently going through a bull market where hype and speculation dominate crypto trading. However, the bear market brings a huge slump. So what do you think about this cycle and its impact on the crypto trading industry? How do you think the youth will shape this space in the coming years? I consider that the bull market hype brings new investors to the crypto industry. So there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with speculative trading during a bull run. Plus, the stock market also goes through cycles so it’s only natural for the crypto market to go through the same. Let me explain this with an example. The Runes hype has brought huge attention to Bitcoin and will provide an impetus to Bitcoin DeFi in the long run. However, as of April, two-thirds of the top 50 Runes are in the red, which means investors are not seeing any immediate profits. People usually blame young investors for having fun with memecoins and making the crypto space akin to gambling. But even Vitalik Buterin thinks such practices are not entirely bad. He recently said, “If people value having fun, and financialized games seem to at least sometimes provide that, then could there be a more positive-sum version…?” I’ll echo Buterin’s statement and say that young investors know what they’re doing and how they want to manage their finances. So even if they’re having fun with meme coins or investing seriously in BTC or ETH, they know the game. That is why I think the youth will drive global crypto adoption and make the web3 space more valuable and utility-driven in the future. Image: Websea Medium Blog\n\n",

    "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been on a hot streak in the past few days, with several large-cap assets posting significant gains in the past week. Most notably, the Bitcoin price bounced back from around $61,000 to above $67,000 for the first time in nearly a month. As expected, this latest price movement has sparked a lot of speculation and discussion around the premier cryptocurrency. Popular blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant has shared on-chain insights into the recent Bitcoin price rally and its future trajectory. How Did Bitcoin Price Reach $67,000? In a recent report, CryptoQuant revealed the catalyst and on-chain manifestations behind BTC’s latest rally to above $67,000. According to the analytics firm, the price of Bitcoin rode to its new highs on the back of the news of lower-than-expected inflation in the United States.

Indicators Suggest Upward Momentum Ahead 5 days ago The inflation data released on Wednesday, May 15 showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in April – lower than the expected 0.4%. This revelation suggested that inflation might be on a downward slope in the US, making risky assets like Bitcoin more attractive. ? #Bitcoin\u0027s price has rallied from $60K to around $66K, driven by lower-than-expected US inflation and reduced selling pressure. Let\u0027s look into the details ?? — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 17, 2024 In its report, CryptoQuant revealed that there has been a decreased selling pressure in the BTC market, as short-term holders are selling at low or negative profits. Meanwhile, Bitcoin balances at over-the-counter (OTC) desks have steadied, implying that fewer coins are entering the open market. What’s more, the analytics platform highlighted a particular on-chain signal that might have predicted the recent Bitcoin price rally. According to CryptoQuant, BTC miners have been extremely underpaid over the past few weeks, which often correlates with price bottoms. The Catalysts For Sustained BTC Rally? CryptoQuant, in its report, identified potential catalysts for a continued rally for the Bitcoin price. According to the on-chain data company, demand from permanent holders and largest investors is on the rise but it needs to climb rapidly to push the price of BTC even higher.

CryptoQuant noted that these two metrics need a jolt, which might be critical for a sustained Bitcoin rally. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price continues to hover around $67,000, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency is up by a significant 10% in the past week.

    "content": "Bitcoin is rising, recently breaking above $67,000, and heading towards the all-important $70,000, a psychological round number. One analyst took to X amid this uptick, noting that whales holding over 1,000 BTC are not moving their coins to exchanges. Instead, they likely expect prices to spike higher in the coming days and weeks. Though movements over the weekend were muted, the extension earlier today is overly bullish for optimistic traders. As BTC prices edge, coin holders (and sometimes whales) usually take profits, especially if gains are shaky and not as strong. Whales Are Not Selling, More Gains Expected? However, the current cycle looks like whales are holding on, expecting prices to recover strongly. The analyst notes that the 30-day average is 641 BTC, with the reading decreasing sharply from mid-2023.

Though this observation doesn’t necessarily mean bulls expect a moonshot, they are holding cement the outlook that prices might move higher in the coming sessions. Related Reading XRP Holders In Panic Selling Frenzy? Sub-$0.50 Looms 2 days ago Accompanying the breakout above $66,0000, on-chain data shows that the Market Value to Realize Value (MVRV) ratio is also rising. According to the analyst, the MVRV ratio for those who have held BTC for between 1 and 3 months has climbed above 66,500. This expansion means they have exited the “unrealized loss” zone, signaling a shift in sentiment among short-term holders. At spot rates and prices trading above $66,700, above the $66,500 level, HODLers are in the green and can exit for a profit or HODL. Bitcoin Finds Strong Support Above $60,000 It remains to be seen how prices will react in the short to medium term. However, another analyst notes that over 530,000 BTC was traded at $66,250. Accordingly, this line is turning out to be a strong, reliable support. If bulls soak in the selling pressure, the line at $66,250 can act as a reliable anchor for the next leg up toward an all-time high.

    "content": "The Bitcoin Halving event is now one month behind us, but the market is still waiting for solid signs of recovery. To attest to this is the fact that the Binance coin has seen a significant decrease in value, further adding fuel to the fire on the market. Right now it’s sitting at $569, which is a 5% decrease compared to last week, highlighting major underperformance compared to the global cryptocurrency market. However, you can still make profits in this bearish environment. Top market experts are saying that the future is in the meme coin market. More specifically in Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), and WienerAI ($WAI) projects. Let’s check out the details. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Binance Coin (BNB) Has Seen Significant Drops in the Past Week – These Hot New Presales Could Save the Day The forefront of the market has long been occupied by BNB, thanks to its close ties with Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. It used to be seen as one of the most stable coins, with minimal price fluctuations. However, recent times have seen a significant shift. Binance Coin experienced substantial drops over the past week, plummeting well below the $600 mark. One contributing factor to this sudden downturn is the recent series of major crypto-related arrests. Ontario’s ‘’Crypto King’’, Aiden Pleterski, was arrested on fraud charges following an 18-month investigation. Authorities found evidence of money laundering using investor funds. Similarly, two US citizens were apprehended for a lightning-fast theft totaling over $25 million. The brothers Anton and James Peraire-Bueno, aided by corrupt IRS agents, allegedly engaged in money fraud and wire laundering. If found guilty, they could face up to 20 years in prison. Despite these setbacks, there are still profit opportunities, especially in the booming meme coin market. Analysts are pointing to new presales as the next big thing, with tokens like Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), WienerAI ($WAI), and Sealana ($SEAL) showing potential for x100 returns. Let’s see the details of each token below. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) Brings New Innovation to the Market as the First Multi-chain Token Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) stands out as the pioneer in multi-blockchain functionality among coins. Its groundbreaking technology seamlessly integrates across 6 major blockchains, a feat never seen before in the crypto realm. Inspired by the successful models of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Dogeverse adopts the beloved dog avatar concept, featuring a quirky space doge navigating the vast crypto landscapes. This character symbolizes the freedom and agility within the crypto space, effortlessly moving between blockchains. The presale phase of Dogeverse witnessed unprecedented success, raking in millions shortly after its ICO launch in April. As of now, the project has amassed over $15 million and is rapidly approaching its hard cap of $17 million, signaling the high demand and investor interest. One of Dogeverse’s strengths is its strong community support, boasting nearly 20,000 followers on X. This massive following is not surprising, given that 25% of the total 200 billion tokens are dedicated to marketing, ensuring widespread visibility and engagement. Investors opting to stake $DOGEVERSE tokens can enjoy various rewards and benefits, with annual percentage yields reaching up to 72% Currently priced at $0.00031 per coin, buying $DOGEVERSE tokens at this stage presents a favorable opportunity, especially considering the anticipated exponential surge in price post-listing. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Dogeverse Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Sealana ($SEAL) is the Future for Solana Based Meme Coins With a Familiar Mascot and Successful ICO Sealana ($SEAL) is a plump seal diving deep into the Solana Sea’s mysteries. He’s glued to his PC, growing larger by the day, fueled by chips and canned tuna. His obsession? Finding the best Solana meme coins, keeping his flippers busy. Inspired by South Park’s World of Warcraft episode, Sealana is the newest SOL meme coin with a ‘Send to Wallet’ presale. Rumor has it that it’s from the same creators behind the viral SLERF token that blew up in March 2024. To get $SEAL, you can use the website widget or send SOL directly to the presale wallet. After the presale, you’ll get token airdrops. Right now, $SEAL is a steal at $0.022, but prices will rise during the presale. It’s smart to get in early. And if you’re sending tokens to Sealana’s wallet, use a DEX wallet to qualify for the airdrop. But what really sets Sealana apart is its community. Unlike other projects, $SEAL fans are active and engaged, sharing memes and insights. This lively atmosphere makes Sealana more than just a meme coin—it’s a community-driven adventure in the crypto world. In short, Sealana isn’t just riding the hype; it’s a symbol of community, innovation, and a bit of seal spirit. Whether you’re a crypto pro or just curious, consider joining Sealana’s journey and see where it takes you in the Solana Sea. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Sealana Now \u003c\u003c\u003c WienerAI ($WAI) is the Next Big Doge-Themed Token Aiming to Combine Crypto and AI WienerAI ($WAI) emerges as the next-gen doge-themed token, integrating cutting-edge AI technology into its framework. Currently, in its presale phase, WienerAI is set to undergo multiple stages. In the ongoing phase, investors can acquire 1 $WAI for $0.000707. This phase is swiftly approaching its conclusion, having already raised close to $2 million within just a month. With only $150,000 remaining to bridge the gap, the next phase promises significant price escalations. Staking is a pivotal aspect of WienerAI, offering generous rewards for token holders. While it’s expected that APYs will decrease as more users adopt the token, early investors stand to benefit from this advantageous opportunity. Down the road, WienerAI plans to integrate an AI bot into its platform, enhancing trade predictions and overall functionality. This forward-looking approach adds another layer of appeal for potential investors interested in the project’s long-term vision and innovation. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Wiener AI Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Conclusion The recent market dip of the famous Binance coin has left investors feeling uneasy about their future finances. However, many experts are optimistic that there are still big profits to be made, more notably in the meme coin market. If you want to jump on the opportunity early, top analysts recommend considering investments in Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), WienerAI ($WAI), and Sealana ($SEAL). Grab these tokens before prices skyrocket after the presale ends. Being among the first to invest could lead to significant gains as these tokens will surely gain traction in the market.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Analyst@tedtalksmacro provides compelling evidence to support his assertion that the current Bitcoin bull run is far from over.\n\n",
    "content": "In an analysis shared via X, renowned crypto analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) has provided compelling evidence to support his assertion that the current Bitcoin bull run is far from over. Ted’s insights are based on four critical indicators related to traditional finance and crypto liquidity, each pointing to sustained growth in the near future. Here’s a breakdown of his analysis: #1 65-Month Liquidity Cycle Ted highlights the 65-month liquidity cycle, a historical pattern that marks the ebb and flow of liquidity in financial markets. According to his analysis, this cycle bottomed out in October 2023, signaling the beginning of a new expansion phase. Related Reading Most Important Bitcoin Indicator Nears Bullish Flip: $150,000 Soon? 6 days ago “We are now in the expansion phase, which is expected to peak in 2026,” Ted stated. This projection aligns with the anticipated easing by central banks in response to slowing economic data over the next 18 to 24 months. Historically, increased liquidity has been a precursor to bull markets in various asset classes, including Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. 65 month liquidity cycle | Source: @tedtalksmacro #2 M2 Money Supply The M2 money supply, which includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money, is another crucial indicator, if not the most important indicator of global liquidity. Ted notes that the rate of expansion in the M2 money supply is at its lowest since the 1990s. “There is plenty of room to the upside for easing liquidity conditions,” he explained. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies to stimulate economies, increased M2 growth could lead to more capital flowing into risk assets like Bitcoin. M2 money supply | Source: @tedtalksmacro #3 Crypto Liquidity While liquidity has returned to the crypto markets, particularly with the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ted points out that the velocity of inflows has not yet reached the levels seen at cycle tops. “The velocity of inflow has not yet seen a manic phase consistent with cycle tops,” he noted. Related Reading Tether Adds Fresh $1 Billion USDT To Supply – Bitcoin To Rally Again? 4 days ago This suggests that while interest and investment in Bitcoin are growing, the market has not yet reached the speculative frenzy that typically precedes a major correction. This phase of measured inflow can provide a more stable foundation for continued price increases. Crypto liquidity | Source: @tedtalksmacro #4 Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows The US based spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant inflows, with last week alone witnessing $950 million flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, the largest net inflow since March. Ted expects these inflows to increase as Bitcoin’s price rises and traditional finance investors regain confidence in the asset. “Expect these to only increase as price drifts higher and tradFi once again renew faith in the asset,” he stated. The growing acceptance and investment from institutional investors via ETFs are a strong bullish indicator for Bitcoin’s continued ascent. Spot Bitcoin ETF flows | Source: @tedtalksmacro Each of these factors points to a sustained and robust bull market for Bitcoin. Ted’s analysis, grounded in traditional financial indicators and crypto-specific data, provides a comprehensive outlook on the current and future state of the Bitcoin market. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies and institutional interest continues to grow, the conditions appear ripe for Bitcoin’s bull run to extend well into the coming years.

Though the series of lower lows posted in the past few trading days is bearish, one analyst is upbeat, expecting an encouraging recovery in the sessions ahead. This Indicator Flashes Green: Time For Bitcoin To Rally? Taking to X, the analyst notes that the 50-day Williams %R oscillator is turning from oversold territory, signaling that the bear run could end. Historically, the indicator has accurately signaled buying opportunities whenever it turns from oversold territory. 50-day Williams oscillator on BTC chart | Source: Analyst on X The Williams %R oscillator is a crucial technical indicator chartists use to assess momentum and identify potential oversold or overbought conditions. When the indicator falls below -80, it suggests the asset being analyzed is oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. Conversely, when it rises above +20, it may mean that the asset is overbought, prompting the trader to adjust their strategy accordingly. Related Reading Newbie Bitcoin Whales Buying 200,000 BTC Per Week, Data Shows 1 week ago Since the beginning of 2023, the analyst observes that the 50-day Williams %R oscillator mapping Bitcoin prices has dipped into oversold territory on four occasions. Notably, each time the oscillator reversed from this zone, BTC prices rose in tandem. Now, with the Williams %R oscillator returning from the oversold territory roughly ten days ago, the analyst is optimistic. It returned from the oversold territory in January 2024, preceding the bull run in Q1 2024. If past performance is anything to go by, BTC is likely ready for a leg up. Considering the extended sideways movement and lower lows since prices peaked in mid-March 2024, this development will be a massive boost for the coin. Does BTC Stand A Chance After Extended Consolidation? The asset has become more dynamic since the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Broader market conditions, such as regulatory changes, macroeconomic trends, and investor sentiment increasingly influence it. Subsequently, this dynamism can impact the accuracy of technical indicators like the Williams % R oscillator. This tool lags and doesn’t factor in events in real time. Therefore, while the oscillator has been reliable in the past, it may not necessarily accurately predict the future cycle.

    "summary": "Meme coins are increasingly seen as a way to bet on the growth of the network they are issued on.\n\nTokens on the Ethereum ecosystem, including meme coins like MOG and PEPE, surged after Bloomberg analysts raised their odds of spot ether ETF approval.\n\nThe new odds, 75% vs 20%, contributed to a market-wide jump, with ether rising over 17% in a day and Bitcoin retaking the $71,000 mark.\n\n",
    "content": "A bunch of Ethereum ecosystem tokens rocketed in the past 24 hours after two Bloomberg analysts raised their odds on the approval of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.\n\nThe cat-themed mog (MOG) token, a reference to a popular TikTok meme, rose nearly 50% while the frog-themed pepe (PEPE) surged more than 20%. Both were initially issued on Ethereum in 2023 and have since become mainstays, alongside bigger ones such as dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB).\n\nAmong utility projects, staking application Lido’s LDO rose 15%, while the ARB token of Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Arbitrum jumped 18%. DOGE and SHIB added 6%.\n\nMeme tokens have been increasingly seen as a leveraged way to bet on the growth of their underlying blockchain. The gains came after Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart updated the odds of approval to 75% from 20% on Monday, causing a market-wide jump. Ether rose over 17%, while bitcoin retook the $71,000 mark for the first time since early April.\n\n“Established memes are generally high beta for the native token of the chain they’re on, and Mog has established itself as a winner on Ethereum while still trading at a fraction of the next biggest meme (Pepe),” a Mog core team member said in an interview over Telegram.\n\n“I think the market sees that there’s quite a lot of room to catch up to Pepe, and that’s why you see the outperformance. If you think memes are good beta; you’ll go for the higher caps like pepe or you’ll slide further down the curve for mog.”\n\nThe focus on meme coins as a way of betting on growth isn\u0027t unique to Ethereum. Several Solana-based meme coin tokens surged from December to March as the network’s SOL tokens took off – contributing to ecosystem growth and attention. Also in December, the Avalanche Foundation, a non-profit that maintains the Avalanche blockchain, said it would invest in meme tokens built on the network in recognition of the online culture and memetic value that such tokens can drive among investors.\n\n\n\n",

    "summary": "AI-generated content creates a huge online disinformation threat. Blockchain can help verify and authenticate that what is being said is true, says William Ogden Moore, Research Analyst at Grayscale Investments.\n\n",
    "content": "As AI continues to work itself into our daily lives, it\u0027s hard not to see the impact it\u0027s already having on nearly every sector. Within the finance industry, for example, AI is facilitating smarter investments, analyzing market trends and predicting stock performance, ultimately helping individuals and institutions make more informed business decisions.\n\nWhile most of the advancements with AI are exciting and continue to push different industries forward, there are those abusing the technology for more nefarious purposes. With generative AI, one of the biggest risks that individuals and organizations need to be aware of are called “deepfakes.”\n\nYou\u0027re reading Crypto Long \u0026 Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nDeepfakes are highly realistic digital forgeries produced with AI to manipulate or generate visual and/or audio content. For example, a deepfake might involve an AI-generated video showing a celebrity engaging in actions or making statements that never actually occurred, such as when comedian Jordan Peele created a deepfake of Barack Obama to showcase the threat AI-generated technology could present.\n\nWhile we may default to believing what we see, this type of forged or deceptive AI-generated content is becoming increasingly more common. Between 2022 and the first half of 2023, deepfakes as a proportion of content in the U.S. increased almost 13 times from 0.2% to 2.6%, according to a recent report from Sumsub Research.\n\nExperts are already concerned deepfakes could be used to try to sway public opinion or influence important events like elections, with bad actors trying to use AI to impersonate elected officials. They are “completely terrified” that the upcoming Presidential race will involve a “tsunami of misinformation,” driven heavily by deepfake and misleading AI-generated content, another recent report noted. Many view deepfakes’ ability to blur the lines between truth and fiction as a fundamental threat to democracies and fair elections around the globe.\n\nSo how do we – as a society – mitigate the prevalence and risks of deepfakes, as well as similar risks that may emerge as generative AI only continues to get more sophisticated?\n\nBlockchains could be the crucial technology we need to help tackle this issue. At their core, public blockchains, such as Ethereum, have several key features that make them uniquely positioned to establish authenticity for content and information. This includes blockchain’s inherent transparency, decentralized nature and focus on network security and immutability.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, a public blockchain transparently records information in a time-bound manner, accessible to all, globally, and without gatekeeping. This allows anyone to verify the validity of information, such as its creator or a timestamp, making it a source of truth. Public blockchains are also decentralized, eliminating the need for a central decision-maker, and reducing the risk of manipulation. This decentralized structure also offers high network security by eliminating single points of failure, and ensuring an immutable and tamper-resistant record.\n\nFurthermore, blockchains have already demonstrated their ability to authenticate content. For instance, with digital art as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain tech allows anyone to verify the creator and owner of a piece of art, enabling our ability to distinguish between the original and its potential replicas. This transparency and authentication potential extends to videos, images, and text, providing important foundations for developers to create solutions and tools geared at combating deepfakes, such as OpenAI’s Worldcoin, Irys and Numbers Protocol.\n\nAs AI\u0027s impact on society grows, AI-generated content and deepfakes will only become more prominent. Harvard experts already predict that more than 90% of content online will be AI-generated in the future. To protect against threats such as deepfakes, it\u0027s crucial we get ahead of the issue and implement innovative solutions. Public blockchains, collectively owned and operated by users, offer promising features like network security, transparency, and decentralization which can help against the issues deepfakes present.\n\nHowever, much of the work underway remains in its early stages, and challenges remain with the technical development and widespread adoption of blockchain-related protocols. While there is no quick fix, we must remain committed to shaping a future that upholds truth, integrity, and transparency, as our society navigates these emerging technologies (and the risks they present) together.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\n",

It\u0027s not clear exactly what started it all, but top Ethereum developers locked horns on the social-media platform X, in an intense and almost uncomfortable-to-observe debate touching on the practice of maximal extractable value, or MEV – essentially, the use of sophisticated trading bots to frontrun user transactions at the point of execution. On May 16, Ethereum core developer Péter Szilágyi tweeted about his despair over the lack of progress in pushing to solve some of the blockchain\u0027s most vexing issues. \"Voila, the banking system recreated,\" he wrote. One of his points was that Ethereum had \"glorified\" MEV, remarking, ostensibly in sarcasm, that it was \"futile to fight against MEV, so might as well lean hard on it, right?\" (As chronicled in last week\u0027s issue of The Protocol, even U.S. government officials now appear to characterize MEV as standard operating procedure on the blockchain.) Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist retweeted Szilágyi\u0027s post with the comment, \"This is such a lazy take if you can\u0027t also tell me what your supposed solutions are that let local block producers extract MEV.\" A back-and-forth ensued, and then Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin chimed in, tweeting that \"I\u0027m really proud that Ethereum does not have any culture of trying to prevent people from speaking their minds, even when they have very negative feelings toward major things in the protocol or ecosystem.\" Buterin, who is known to write long, interrupted his work on a project in Kenya to bang out a 3,000-word-plus essay breaking down the issues, concluding: \"I also do not think that the situation is anywhere near as hopeless as Peter\u0027s tweets imply.\"\n\nET TU, DANKRAD? The Buterin tweet referenced in that ^^^ episode touched off an entirely separate donnybrook. The pseudonymous crypto influencer Cobie responded to Buterin\u0027s tweet, asking the very pointed question of how he felt about \"core developers or researchers taking life–changing $ packages from projects built on Ethereum to become \u0027advisors,\u0027 when those projects may have conflicted incentives with Ethereum, either now or in the future.\" At first it wasn\u0027t quite clear what the comment referred to. But then, as reported by CoinDesk\u0027s Margaux Nijkerk, a top Ethereum Foundation developer, Justin Drake, disclosed that he had taken on a role advising EigenFoundation, with \"a significant token incentive which could easily be worth more than the combined value of all my other assets (mostly ETH),\" and a value of \"millions of dollars of tokens vesting over 3 years.\" EigenFoundation supports the restaking protocol EigenLayer, a controversial project partly because experts have warned of its potential systemic risks to the Ethereum blockchain. Shortly after that, Feist (also mentioned ^^^) confessed that he, too, had accepted a paid role at EigenFoundation. The news set off a debate on crypto twitter about whether advising the EigenFoundation would constitute a conflict of interest. \"Even if you pinky promise to not let this cloud your judgment, and do it on a personal capacity, that\u0027s impossible,\" wrote Lefteris Karapetsas. One clever jokester deadpanned that the Ethererum researchers were \"restaking themselves now.\"\n\nALSO:\n\nTop picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.\n\nThroughput-Latency graph comparing Mysticeti-C performance with state-of-the-art consensus protocols (Arxiv)\n\n1.

    "content": "The ratio between ether (ETH) and bitcoin’s (BTC) dollar-denominated prices continues to slide, extending year-to-date losses as suggested by the bearish death cross pattern a month ago.\n\nETH/BTC slipped to 0.04563 on crypto exchange Binance soon before press time, reaching the lowest since April 2021, according to charting platform TradingView. This year, the ratio has declined nearly 16%, indicating a bias for bitcoin or the leading cryptocurrency by market value.\n\nThe slide to three-year lows follows reduced demand for exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to ether.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data quoted by ETC Group in its weekly report, global ether ETPs registered net outflows of around $63.5 million last week, with Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) losing the most. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETPs raked in $92.5 million last week.\n\nSeveral factors, including competing layer 1s and lingering uncertainty about the debut of spot ETH approvals in the U.S, are likely responsible for ETH falling out of investor favor.\n\n“The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has reinforced bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative and its status as a macro asset. On the other hand, open questions about ETH’s fundamental positioning within the crypto sector remain. Competing layer-1s (L1s) like Solana detract from Ethereum’s positioning as the \u0027go-to\u0027 network for decentralized app (dApp) deployment,” Coinbase Institutional’s Research analyst David Han said in a note Wednesday.\n\nSolana’s share in total decentralized exchange volumes has grown tenfold from 2% to 21% in one year, eating into Ethereum\u0027s market share.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighted nearly a dozen spot BTC ETFs in January. Since then, these funds have drawn roughly $12 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors.\n\nApproval of spot ETFs tied to ether will open a similar pool of capital for Ethereum’s native token, although it’s unclear when the SEC will approve it.\n\nTraders on decentralized betting platform Polymarket see just a 10% chance of the SEC approving a spot ETF on or before May 31. The regulator has until May 23 to decide whether to approve or reject VanEck’s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF. The deadline for BlackRock’s application is June 23.\n\nAccording to finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, the SEC is looking for reasons to deny ETH ETF applications by BlackRock and others on grounds that they have been improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they hold a security.\n\nIlan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said ether is a \"lightning rod\" for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots.\n\n“Capital gets fragmented. There are proportionally greater numbers of ways to get exposure to the ecosystem through the many Layer 2s tokens (OP, ARB…) and native protocol tokens in each one. The capital gets fragmented,\" Solot said in an email.\n\nSolot added that strong anti-ETH sentiment from [rival] Solana community and Bitcoin propounders is driving negative ether narratives and the high beta cryptocurrency is a \"perfect vehicle\" for external players to express bearish view given it trades on traditional exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nLastly, Ether recently turned inflationary, reversing the bullish deflationary supply trend seen consistently since its parent network Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus ecosystem in September 2022.\n\n",

It is keeping the ban in place for retail investors.\n\nWisdomTree\u0027s products will carry fees of 35 basis points, while 21Shares has not disclosed theirs as yet.\n\nNeither Atlanta, Georgia-based Invesco nor the LSE responded to CoinDesk\u0027s request for further comment.\n\nRead More: DWS, Galaxy Digital List Exchange-Traded Commodities Offering BTC, ETH Exposure in Germany\n\nUPDATE (May 22, 12:35 UTC): Adds a line on 21Shares and Invesco also getting their prospectuses approved.\n\nUPDATE (May 22, 14:37 UTC): Rewrites headline, top of story to reflect applications of 21Shares and Invesco.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nBitcoin hovered around the $70,000 mark during the European morning, a slight drop following Tuesday\u0027s rally to as high as $71,400. BTC is currently priced at $70,069, around 1.6% lower over 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), offering a measurement of the broader digital asset market, fell about 0.5%. BlackRock\u0027s spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded over $290 million in inflows on Tuesday, its highest one-day figure since April 5 and nearly three times the previous high this month: $93 million on May 16. As a whole, ETFs took on nearly $300 million in net inflows on Tuesday.\n\nEther\u0027s market cap rose by over $70 billion on Tuesday, not far off the entire market value of Solana\u0027s sol token at around $80 billion. The ether price surged more than 19% on Monday for a total of $439 billion, according to data source TradingView. The surge followed renewed hopes that a spot ether ETF will be approved in the U.S. Analysts say the gap between ether and rivals like SOL will widen in the coming months as a potential spot ETF launch opens the token to mainstream institutional adoption. At the time of writing, ETH is priced at $3,726, a decrease of just over 0.8% in the last 24 hours.\n\nWisdomTree has been given the green light to list bitcoin and ether ETPs on the London Stock Exchange. The asset manager said it was among the first applicants to have its prospectus given the go-ahead by the FCA. The Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) and Physical Ethereum (ETHW) ETPs are expected to start trading on May 28 and will be available only to professional investors. They will carry fees of 35 basis points. The FCA said in March it would not object to requests from financial institutions seeking to list ETPs for professional investors, a partial lift on the ban it put in place in 2020. The products however remain out of bounds for retail investors.\n\n- Omkar Godbole\n\n",

    "content": "A U.K. general election, which could see the crypto-friendly Conservative Party lose its governing mandate, will take place on July 4, earlier than expected.\n\n\"Earlier today I spoke with His Majesty the King to request the dissolution of Parliament, the King has granted this request and we will have the general election on the fourth of July,\" U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in his statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe Conservative Party has said it wants the U.K. to be a crypto hub and has been instrumental in passing legislation recognizing digital assets as regulated financial services in the country. In March, the government hosted members of the crypto community at the prime minister’s official residence at No.10, Downing Street to restate its plan to build legislation for the sector. Stablecoin and staking legislation was expected to come out in the coming weeks, though so far none has been proposed.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak, who was among the first Conservative Party politicians to set U.K. crypto hub plans in motion, set the date for the election, which could see his party fall after a turbulent 14 years of rule that included the 2020 exit from the European Union and the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe last general election, held in December 2019, handed the Conservatives – also known as the Tories – 365 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons. Second-placed Labour won 202. What followed was a period that saw four prime ministers pass through the doors of No. 10, including Liz Truss, who served just 50 days, the shortest term in U.K. history. Her predecessor, Boris Johnson, was forced to resign after breaking Covid lockdown rules and a scandal relating to the appointment of a deputy chief whip.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party is the favorite to win the election, according to polls of voting intentions. Labour has not made any statement about crypto legislation. However, the party has said it wants the U.K. to be a tokenization hub and will support the Bank of England\u0027s digital pound plans. Tokenization is the creation of a blockchain-based object that represents a real-world asset such as a work of art or a bar of gold.\n\nRead more: Industry Stakeholders Believe a UK Election Won\u0027t Derail Crypto Plans\n\nUPDATE (May 22, 2024, 16:31 UTC): Adds Rishi Sunak quote to 2nd paragraph.\n\n",

    "summary": "By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers, Montclair State University adjunct professor Burak Tamac writes.\n\n",
    "content": "As bitcoin (BTC) continues to gain traction worldwide, the approach to introducing it to newcomers plays a crucial role in its widespread adoption. While some advocates firmly believe in a \"Bitcoin only\" narrative, this aggressive stance can often hinder the conversation and deter potential adopters.\n\nInstead, a \"Bitcoin first\" approach, which prioritizes education and understanding, may prove more effective in fostering genuine interest and long-term investment in bitcoin.\n\nBurak Tamac is an adjunct professor at Montclair State University, teaching politics and technology.\n\nThis essay is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.\n\nProponents of the \"Bitcoin only\" narrative often argue passionately for the superiority of bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies. However, this approach can come across as confrontational and off-putting to those who are new to the concept. When people feel attacked or told that their current investments are wrong, they are more likely to disengage from the conversation entirely. This is particularly true in countries like Turkey, where many individuals are already familiar with alternative investments like altcoins.\n\nTo effectively promote bitcoin adoption, the focus should shift from telling people what to do to providing them with the knowledge to make informed decisions. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in understanding the broader cryptocurrency landscape, educators can help people grasp the unique features and advantages of bitcoin without disparaging other investments outright.\n\nWhen individuals learn about the Bitcoin network\u0027s decentralized nature, its limited supply and its potential as a store of value, they can better appreciate its significance. This foundation of knowledge allows them to evaluate other cryptocurrencies more critically and recognize the authenticity of bitcoin\u0027s value proposition.\n\nSee also: Allen Farrington: Capital in the 21st Century | Opinion\n\nEncouraging people to blindly invest in bitcoin without proper understanding is a short-sighted approach. When individuals buy bitcoin solely based on hype or fear of missing out, they are more likely to panic sell during market fluctuations. This behavior not only harms their personal financial well-being but also discourages them to learn more about bitcoin.\n\nIn contrast, when people invest in bitcoin after learning about its fundamentals and long-term potential, they are more likely to hold their investments through market cycles. This informed decision-making promotes stability and helps to build a stronger, more resilient Bitcoin community.\n\nTo accelerate bitcoin adoption, I believe advocates should prioritize education to start a conversation; and the education should not start about what they do wrong, but what they can do more. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy and technological understanding, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers.\n\nBy adopting a \"Bitcoin first\" approach that prioritizes education and understanding, we can create a more welcoming and empowering environment for newcomers. This shift in narrative, from \"Bitcoin only\" to \"Bitcoin first,\" has the potential to accelerate adoption.\n\n",

    "content": "A top Ethereum Foundation (EF) developer, Dankrad Feist, disclosed Tuesday that he has accepted a paid role at EigenFoundation, a newly created non-profit meant to guide EigenLayer, the pioneering \"restaking\" protocol that many skeptics have flagged as potentially posing systemic risks to the world\u0027s largest smart-contracts blockchain.\n\nFeist disclosed in a post on X that the position comes with a significant allocation of EigenLayer’s new EIGEN token, though did not specify how many tokens he would be receiving.\n\nThe announcement comes a few days after another top EF developer, Justin Drake, also disclosed that he would be advising the EigenFoundation, with \"a significant token incentive which could easily be worth more than the combined value of all my other assets (mostly ETH),\" with a value of \"millions of dollars of tokens vesting over 3 years.\"\n\nThe news set off a debate on crypto twitter about whether advising the EigenFoundation would constitute a conflict of interest, especially given how prominent Drake and Feist are at the Ethereum Foundation – and how serious many blockchain experts are taking the potential systemic threats posed by the emergence of EigenLayer.\n\nThe disclosures came after the crypto influencer Cobie used the social-media platform X, where he has 724,000 followers, to publicly ask Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin how he felt about \"core developers or researchers taking life–changing $ packages from projects built on Ethereum to become \u0027advisors,\u0027 when those projects may have conflicted incentives with Ethereum, either now or in the future?\"\n\nThat post came in response to a post by Buterin in which he wrote that he was \"really proud that Ethereum does not have any culture of trying to prevent people from speaking their minds.\"\n\nSome posters on X applauded the Cobie call-out.\n\n“Props to @cobie for insisting on ethical disclosures and holding people to account despite the onslaught of toxic bagerholderism he gets in response...very few willing to do it,” said @lex_node on X.\n\nFeist is a well known contributor to the Ethereum discourse and technology, so prominent that the technology of \"danksharding\" – a way of storing data at cheaper fees than from using regular transactions – is named after him.\n\n\"I am taking this position personally, not representing the Ethereum Foundation, and with a focus on risks and decentralization. I am therefore fully expected to take contrarian views on Eigenlayer,\" Feist wrote in his post. \"I do receive a significant amount of tokens from this position. I do not believe that they will change or influence my positions on how the core protocol should be developed, but I believe that the community should know about this, so that they can keep me accountable.\"\n\nFeist acknowledged that many skeptics fear \"Eigenlayer will lead to a dystopia of dangerously designed restaking services,\" and that a \"second type of risk comes from the additional load imposed on stakers by running restaking services,\" which \"can lead to centralizing forces.\"\n\n\"I think Eigenlayer will be a major benefit to Ethereum, if it is done by someone with high integrity,\" Feist wrote. \"I trust the current leaders are intending to do that, and I am planning to hold them accountable for it.\"\n\nDrake noted in his disclosure that he pledged \"to reinject all advisorship proceeds towards worthy projects within the Ethereum ecosystem, either as investments or donations,\" and that he also stands ready \"to end the advisorship at any time, e.g. should EigenLayer go in a direction I deem to be against Ethereum\u0027s interests.\"\n\nHe also said that, given his \"focus on restaking risks,\" one can expect his \"default public stance to continue to lean critical of EigenLayer.\"\n\n\"I will try to make my criticism constructive, advocating for mitigations to risks like the erosion of solo validators and the intersubjective overloading of Ethereum consensus,” Drake wrote.\n\nAnother user on X, @themandalore9, wrote: “I applaud the transparency, but he was probably the biggest / most well known voice in the fight against LST\u0027s and restaking.

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Lawmakers are set to vote on the FIT21 bill Wednesday afternoon.\n\n",
    "content": "The U.S. House of Representatives is poised to vote in favor of a crypto market structure bill for the first time, in a symbolic effort to radically reshape the country\u0027s digital asset regulatory landscape.\n\nThe Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, sponsored by members of the House Financial Services and House Agriculture Committees, will begin seeing votes Wednesday afternoon, where it is expected to pass with a bipartisan majority.\n\nThe bill, dubbed FIT21, would grant the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) greater spot-market authority over digital assets deemed to be commodities, while also creating new jurisdictional lines for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Crypto companies and digital asset issuers would have a framework for determining whether and how their assets are securities under the terms defined by the bill, which in turn would let them know who their primary regulator could be.\n\nRep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who chairs the Financial Services Committee, told reporters on Tuesday that he hoped for \"a substantial vote\" in favor of the legislation to demonstrate that there is real momentum for digital asset legislation, a week after the Senate voted in favor of a House resolution that overturned SEC accounting guidance.\n\nThe bill is expected to pass, with a handful of Democrats joining a majority of Republicans in voting in favor of the bill. The bill\u0027s path through the Senate is less clear, and the White House earlier Wednesday said it opposed the legislation, though President Joe Biden did not threaten a veto.\n\nThe bill has been the subject of a large amount of discussion in recent days.\n\nRep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), one of at least nine Democrat lawmakers who said they would support the bill, said he \"look[ed] forward to working with my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee on our continued oversight of this issue.\"\n\n\"FIT21 is an important step forward in the regulation of the cryptocurrency industry and a meaningful improvement on the status quo,\" he said in a statement.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) announced he would vote in favor of the bill shortly before the vote on Wednesday, saying \"we need blockchain innovation here in America.\"\n\nRep. French Hill (R-Ark.) told reporters on Tuesday that the bill creates a \"5-step test on whether something is a decentralized blockchain or not,\" and includes a roadmap for the regulator to utilize.\n\nIn comments to the House Rules Committee, he said the lawmakers who developed the bill had engaged with regulators – including the SEC – for more than a year, incorporating their feedback to the legislation.\n\n\"We included provisions to mitigate conflicts of interest. We impose capital and other necessary requirements on intermediaries. And we impose higher standards for custody,\" he said.\n\nThere\u0027s an interim process as well, where companies need to file a \"notice of intent to register\" with the agencies, he said.\n\nRead more: Democrat House Leadership Says Crypto Bill Vote Won\u0027t Be Whipped\n\nOpposition to the bill, however, starts within the House Financial Services Committee itself.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the committee, dubbed the bill the \"not fit for purpose act\" and told the House Rules Committee on Tuesday that it \"is perhaps the worst, most harmful deregulatory proposal I have seen in a long time,\" likening it to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. The CFMA, Waters charged, deregulated certain derivatives products which later \"blew up our economy when AIG collapsed.\"\n\nFIT21 does not give the CFTC greater authority to target fraud or other crimes, despite directing the agency to oversee digital commodities, she said. The bill also sunsets disclosure requirements after 180 days, meaning the regulator cannot force companies it\u0027s supposed to regulate to provide audited financial statements past that deadline.\n\n\"What is even more problematic is the bill’s definition of quote \u0027investment contract assets,\u0027\" she said. \"Securities that meet this definition would be transferred into a regulatory void, with no primary regulator and virtually no laws and regulations to speak of. Importantly, the definition of investment contract asset is not limited to crypto, and it would be fairly easy for both crypto and traditional securities to be formatted to meet this definition.\"\n\nA group of unions, consumer protection organizations, academics and others sent a public letter to House Speaker Michael Johnson (R-La.) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) asking them to vote against the bill and laying out a list of concerns similar to Gensler\u0027s.\n\nThe letter took aim at the industry more broadly, saying crypto \"still struggles to demonstrate viable use cases outside of speculative investment\" and referencing the various ongoing bankruptcies and civil and criminal litigation.\n\n\"The industry has superficially recovered this year, in part due to controversial approval of spot BTC ETPs by the Securities Exchange Commission,\" the letter said. \"Yet, the scams, hacks, theft, instability, reckless promotional activities, and regulatory evasion that were present during the last crypto bull market remain endemic in the industry today.\"\n\nThe letter was signed by organizations including the AFL-CIO, Americans for Financial Reform, Revolving Door Project, the National Consumer Law Center and over 30 others as well as 10 individuals.\n\nEchoing Gensler, the groups said they are concerned the bill would weaken existing securities laws to the point where even non-crypto companies could \"evade more rigorous oversight\" by tying themselves to a decentralized network (or at least claiming they were tied to a decentralized network). While the bill gives the CFTC greater authority, the letter said this authority \"is vague,\" to the point it could undermine other agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n\"All told, we believe this bill as written introduces a policy \u0027cure\u0027 that would be far worse than the disease and create significant harm within and far beyond the crypto industry,\" the letter said.\n\nAdvocates for the bill argue that legislation is needed to support companies\u0027 efforts to \"build a better financial services system and better internet.\"\n\n\"Since the inception of the Bitcoin network in 2009, the blockchain and digital asset industry has existed without targeted market regulation,\" a letter filed by the Blockchain Association, a lobby group, said. \"The absence of clear rules leads to confusion in the marketplace for companies – and leaves users and consumers unprotected.\"\n\nRead more: Crypto Industry Rallies Behind House Bill as It Heads Toward Final Vote\n\nThe letter, signed by groups including stablecoin issuer Circle, Ethereum incubator ConsenSys, venture capital firm Digital Currency Group, exchanges such as Kraken and 50 other companies in the sector, went on to argue that the \"lack of clarity\" risked putting the U.S. behind in \"the global technology race.\"\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler published a statement on Wednesday opposing the legislation. In it, he raised the specter of crypto\u0027s various collapses and frauds, suggesting the bill might allow even traditional pump and dumpers or penny stock pushers to escape oversight by branding themselves as using decentralized networks.\n\n\"We should make the policy choice to protect the investing public over facilitating business models of noncompliant firms,\" he said.\n\n",

    "summary": "One trader said rising risk appetite for alternative assets could cause bitcoin to exceed the $70,000 level over the weekend.\n\nBitcoin could potentially surpass its all-time highs of $74,000 as early as next week due to increasing institutional demand and risk appetite for assets.\n\nThe U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Bitcoin have seen four straight days of inflows, with BlackRock\u0027s IBIT receiving $94 million on Thursday, signaling a shift in investment sentiment.\n\n",
    "content": "Institutional demand and rising appetite for risk assets could cause bitcoin to breach all-time highs of $74,000 as early as next week, some traders say.\n\n“Bitcoin was pulling back towards $65K on Thursday but is already trying to regain its footing above $66K on Friday morning. If cryptocurrencies get support from the global risk appetite on Friday, Bitcoin could exceed $70K over the weekend,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in a note to CoinDesk, referring to increased inflows from spot ETFs.\n\n“A test of the $71K-$74K highs area, in our view, could happen as early as early next week, triggering a new episode of FOMO,” Kuptsikevich.\n\nSingapore-based QCP Capital gave out similar price targets in a client note earlier this week.\n\nSuch bullish outlooks come as U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the asset have logged four straight days of inflows, ending Thursday at $257 million in net inflows. This is a nearly 180-degree turn from the action of the past few weeks – with some of the biggest ETFs seeing zero inflows on some days.\n\nBlackRock’s IBIT received $94 million in inflows on Thursday, the largest among peers. GrayScale’s GBTC, which has mostly seen outflows since its January listing, received over $4.6 million in inflows.\n\nEarlier this week, multiple regulatory filings showed that several big-name funds, such as Millennium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios.\n\nThe softer-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggered a break out of the range for BTC on Wednesday. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March.\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surged 10% after completing its reward halving event, becoming one of the few gainers in an otherwise tepid market as bitcoin (BTC) – whose own halving occurs later this month – remained little changed over 24 hours.\n\nBCH changed hands at $660 in European morning hours, a price level not seen since December 2021. The token remains 80% below a lifetime peak of $3,700 set in December 2017.\n\nBitcoin Cash’s block reward is now 3.125 BCH. Halving occurs when the reward for mining transactions is cut by 50%, reducing the rate at which new coins are created and thus lowering the available new supply.\n\nBitcoin’s own halving is expected on April 20, trackers show, and has historically preceded a bull market for the token. The previous halving, in 2020, spurred a 1,000% run to a then-record high of $69,000 roughly a year and a half later.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained\n\nOpen interest on BCH-tracked futures swelled to $700 million earlier this week from below $200 million in March, showing an increase in leveraged bets on more expected price volatility, as previously reported.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto markets remained little changed in the past 24 hours amid the lack of market-moving catalysts.

    "title": "Phemex Promises Market-Beating Borrowing Rates With Its New Lending Protocol, Elevates Engagement to New Heights With Pulse Season 3",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The leading exchange continues to innovate in response to user needs. Its lending protocol offers a one-stop solution for all borrowing and lending requirements, while the upcoming upgrade to the SocialFi tool Pulse is designed to reward high-quality engagement.\n\nIncrease capital and leverage through asset-backed loans,\n\nEnjoy competitive rates and\n\nExperience seamless fund mobility.\n\n",
    "content": "Phemex, a top-tier cryptocurrency exchange, continues its streak of CeFi and DeFi innovations. Transitioning from a purely centralized platform, Phemex embraced decentralization last year and has evolved into a hybrid exchange, merging the best features of CEXes and DEXes. The latest fruit of this evolution is the Phemex Lending Protocol, which allows users to borrow cryptocurrency against their digital assets with favorable rates and ultimate flexibility, signaling Phemex\u0027s commitment to innovative, user-empowering solutions.\n\nWhile crypto enthusiasts have long expected that feature from their exchanges, Phemex revealed earlier this week some new advantages that can’t be found anywhere else.\n\nIf you think about it, there are three main reasons why you might want to use any crypto exchange’s lending services:\n\nBy each of these measures, the Phemex Lending Protocol meets or exceeds industry standards. Participants can take out loans denominated in USDT, BTC or ETH without the need to sell their crypto assets. Loans can also be taken out in PT, Phemex’s high-potential native coin.\n\nBecause all loans are securely collateralized by participants’ assets, Phemex can provide flexibility to choose loan terms with variable interest rates. Whatever the time horizon on the loan, crypto exchanges can generally offer better rates than brick-and-mortar banks, according to Forbes Advisor.\n\nEven so, the Phemex team is confident that their loans compare favorably even among crypto exchanges. Phemex highlights its competitive edge with an annual USDT borrowing interest rate starting at 3.57%, a figure notably lower than the double-digit rates prevalent on competing platforms – not to mention almost two percentage points lower than money-center banks lend to each other overnight. For holders of vePT – the wrapped PT version that will soon confer voting authority in Phemex’s governing DAO – the deal gets even sweeter with an additional 30% discount on borrowing rates.\n\nOf course, Phemex community members can withdraw and reallocate funds as they see fit, unfettered by undue limitations or delays. This means that Phemex traders can enjoy more lucrative capital efficiency than they can on other exchanges, aligning with the cryptosphere’s goal of unlocking the potential of money.\n\nAt Token2049 in Dubai last week, Phemex made a significant splash by hosting an elite gathering of major crypto community players and key opinion leaders. The extensive two-day networking event featured an insightful keynote by Phemex CEO Federico Variola. Another highlight of Token2049 was the introduction of the Phemex Lending Protocol, when Phemex COO Stella Chan showcased its competitive borrowing rates and the opportunity for users to supply assets in return for substantial earnings. In the future, the platform is expected to add uncollateralized loan capabilities which would propel its services beyond that of most DeFi lending protocols.\n\n“Phemex Lending Protocol is changing the game with low borrowing rates and a clear loan-to-value ratio, without any hidden fees,\" Chan announced. \"With $22 million in liquidity to start, users can now secure loans leveraging their holdings at just 3.57% APY – far below the high rates of other platforms. Our protocol ensures that users keep control, allowing them to freely withdraw and manage their funds. Additionally, by contributing to our lending pools, they can earn competitive APY returns, creating a robust passive income stream. It\u0027s a complete solution for favorable borrowing and earning.”\n\nBy integrating these lending features, Phemex is not only expanding its services but also reinforcing its commitment to fostering a more inclusive and accessible financial environment for all its users.\n\nCertainly, Phemex has a grander vision than just providing lower interest rates on collateralized loans. The team there has been all about innovation. All this leads into its Web3 ecosystem, Phemexia, aiming to provide users with greater autonomy and cultivate a robust community where trust and permissionless collaboration are paramount.\n\n“Phemex is at the forefront as the crypto world evolves far beyond just digital cash, spearheading the charge into a digital ecosystem integral to our online lives,\" Chan says. \"Our users want democratized financial tools with uncompromising security, and we\u0027re delivering just that. We\u0027re pioneering in the Web3 space, answering the call with innovations like our new hybrid stack. It combines on-chain autonomy with reliable centralized performance, showcased by our latest offering – the Phemex Lending Protocol.\n\nSoon, users will be able to enhance our exchange\u0027s liquidity and earn rewards using our AMM protocol. We\u0027re eager to drive more innovation and sustain our collaborations with visionary partners in upcoming integrations and listings.”\n\nWhile Phemex’s PT token may be the most successful exchange-native coin this year, Phemex also generated a lot of buzz with the launch of its new SocialFi product Pulse. The platform elevates community groups within the social media realm by offering a decentralized hub, similar to a mix of Telegram\u0027s groups and Twitter\u0027s connectivity, but within the realm of Web3. Pulse sets itself apart with a unique reward system where community interaction directly earns users PT, a feature unmatched by any other social network.\n\nPhemex is now gearing up for the launch of Pulse Season 3, responding to community feedback by enhancing the platform with features that incentivize superior content. With the introduction of “Cast” for sharing insightful content and “Tip” as a way to appreciate high-quality engagement, users can now earn tips for their casts, increasing their chances of winning a portion of the daily 10,000 PT prize pool and ensuring that outstanding content is rewarded.\n\nUltimately, the team’s goal is to expand Web3 use cases into the broader world. The more people get comfortable with blockchain technology and functions, the more widely digital assets will gain acceptance – and the faster these assets will appreciate in value.\n\n“Our mission is rooted in providing a user-centric ecosystem that offers the best trading experiences alongside a vibrant community. As we roll out our hybrid stack with the Phemex Lending launch, we\u0027re simultaneously fine-tuning Pulse based on user insights,” Chan says. “Community-driven development is pivotal to Pulse\u0027s growth, and with Season 3 on the horizon, we aim to reward the creation and engagement of premium content. We are dedicated to nurturing a community where meaningful interaction is recognized and rewarded.”\n\n",

With the zkEVM, developers will instead be able to code with Solidity, the most common programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, making the Starknet blockchain more accessible to a broader array of project builders.\n\nKakarot is currently in a “public whitelist” phase, according to a press release seen by CoinDesk. This means that only a select few developers will have access to the Kakarot zkEVM before it hits mainnet, to test out new protocol changes.\n\n“This is a great sign of Starknet’s growth and maturity,\" said the CEO of StarkWare, Eli Ben-Sasson, in a statement to CoinDesk. \"Starknet dared to be different, and use the powerful Cairo language, instead of Solidity. At the same time, some developers want the zkEVM approach, and for that reason, this is excellent news for the network.”\n\nThe announcement comes as StarkWare recently shared that it will be coming out with a new cryptographic prover, called “Stwo.”\n\nRead more: StarkWare Unveils New \u0027Stwo\u0027 Cryptographic Prover That\u0027s \u0027Blazingly Fast\u0027\n\n",

    "title": "BlockFi’s Rise and Fall: A Timeline",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "BlockFi, a crypto lending company, was founded in October 2017 and filed for bankruptcy just over five years later in the wake of FTX\u0027s collapse.\n\n",
    "content": "Crypto lender BlockFi is kaput. The platform, which offered high yields on crypto deposits, has filed for bankruptcy protection. It’s the latest company to fall after the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Indeed, bankruptcy filings show that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. But how did it all go so wrong? CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture.\n\nZac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company’s chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral.\n\nVenture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer.\n\nFlush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it \"doesn’t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.” As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn’t seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company.\n\nThe firm’s next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts.\n\nIn December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood’s business model. “Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,” BlockFi’s CEO said.\n\nPeter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led BlockFi’s $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping “BlockFi expand into Singapore” and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nBlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to “crypto payment rails” such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren\u0027t already cryptocurrency owners.” The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform.\n\nAll was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee’s phone with a “SIM swap” that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee’s phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi’s retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi’s customers.\n\nIn August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors.\n\nIn October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk\u0027s parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020.\n\nBlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin.\n\nEarly in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale’s product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nAll was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin’s soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong?\n\nNew Jersey’s Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state’s financial regulator claimed BlockFi’s interest accounts amounted to sales of an “unregistered security” and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers.\n\nThe CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that – and it didn’t end well for BlockFi (we’ll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card.\n\nIn February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. “Today’s settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.\n\nIn June, BlockFi’s valuation sank to $1 billion in a “down round” – a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund\u0027s collateral before its bankruptcy. In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi’s main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nIn dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren’t met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S.\n\nAt the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11.\n\nThat was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX’s credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid “the lack of clarity” about FTX. On Nov. 11, California’s financial regulator revoked BlockFi’s lending license.\n\nBlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried\u0027s Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan.\n\nIn the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX. All the while, one question looms: Will customers get anything back?\n\nRead More: Latest BlockFi Stories\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "A new White House statement suggests not even the president who appointed the SEC chairman thinks the government can go on overseeing digital assets without new policy.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler is holding the line that he doesn\u0027t need legislation to police crypto, even as the White House and others say they\u0027re ready to hash out regulatory policies.\n\nA presidential policy statement on Wednesday said the White House is eager to establish a \"comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework.\"\n\n",
    "content": "The White House is \"eager\" to work on a crypto bill. That was the sentiment of its latest statement on Wednesday, putting the administration on-the-record again about wanting new digital assets policies to protect investors.\n\nBut U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler – the securities watchdog President Joe Biden hired as a member of his transition team and a key regulator – says don\u0027t bother. Gensler\u0027s strong view that existing laws give his agency plenty of authority seems to go against other U.S. regulatory agencies, the White House and its Treasury Department.\n\nGensler, in a statement he issued against the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) on Wednesday – as the bill heads toward a vote that\u0027s expected to count a significant number of Democratic supporters – accused crypto firms again of showing \"their unwillingness to comply with applicable laws and regulations for more than a decade, variously arguing that the laws do not apply to them or that a new set of rules should be created and retroactively applied to them to excuse their past conduct.\"\n\n\"The crypto industry’s record of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies is not because we don\u0027t have rules or because the rules are unclear,\" Gensler argued. \"It’s because many players in the crypto industry don’t play by the rules.\"\n\nBiden\u0027s White House may not like FIT21 either, but a policy statement the same morning said the administration is \"eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities.\"\n\nRep. French Hill (R-Ark.) said in a CoinDesk TV interview on Wednesday that many House Democrats \"recognize that the existing Securities and Exchange Commission rules are inadequate.\" Hill added that FIT21 is trying to give Gensler\u0027s agency a roadmap for handling this sector.\n\n\"I cannot explain why he\u0027s taken the position that he had,\" Hill said. \"I think he\u0027s isolated from other regulatory leaders.\"\n\nThe SEC didn\u0027t immediately respond to a request Wednesday to comment on whether Gensler sees himself at odds with fellow government officials.\n\nThe SEC\u0027s sister agency in policing the U.S. markets, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC), has taken a strong pro-legislation position, arguing that existing law leaves a hole in oversight of the crypto spot markets for non-securities, such as bitcoin (BTC). CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam has told lawmakers that \"Congress needs to act\" on crypto legislation, and he\u0027s said that if FIT21 passes, his agency can build a regulatory framework within 12 months. A CFTC spokesperson told CoinDesk on Tuesday that the agency would not comment on the bill.\n\nConsumer-protection groups seem to be in Gensler\u0027s corner on this, and Mark Hays, a senior policy analyst for Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress, dismissed the apparent contrasts among different corners of the federal government.\n\n\"It reflects slightly different takes on what\u0027s important and the \u0027art\u0027 of what\u0027s possible in politics,\" he told CoinDesk in an email. The regulators \"all have different tools to address crypto regulation matters. Some of them have exercised that role effectively; others could do more.\"\n\nThe spot-markets gap could be filled by separate legislation naming the SEC its regulator, said Hays, who argued that in matters of investor protection the SEC\u0027s view should get some deference, despite the CFTC \"playing the spoiler.\" His groups are among dozens of organizations opposing FIT21 on consumer-protection grounds.\n\nThe federal courts – despite Gensler\u0027s contention that judges have agreed with his agency \"time and again\" on crypto matters – haven\u0027t yet provided consistent answers on whether tokens should be treated as securities, and the final say may still need to come from the U.S. Supreme Court. So, it\u0027s a race between Congress and the courts on who will define how tokens such as bitcoin, Ethereum\u0027s ether (ETH), tether (USDT) and solana (SOL) should be handled in the U.S.\n\nAmong other government voices clamoring for crypto legislation, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said earlier this year that \"Congress should pass legislation to provide for the regulation of stablecoins and of the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities.\" The Treasury interest in the spot markets and illicit finance doesn\u0027t leave a clear picture yet on exactly what the administration\u0027s financial arm would be interested in for crypto oversight, though the White House has certainly indicated that FIT21 isn\u0027t it.\n\nBut whether the government likes it or not, that\u0027s the first crypto bill that will receive a vote in one of the chambers of Congress, leaving it as the most prominent piece of digital assets legislation in the conversation.\n\n\"We\u0027re disappointed that Chairman Gensler doesn\u0027t see that this is better than current law and gives him the tools, ability, and a process that can allow him to be a better regulator and a better supervisor in this space,\" Hill said.\n\nRead More: SEC\u0027s Gensler Says House Bill Would \u0027Undermine\u0027 Regulator\u0027s Crypto, Capital Markets Oversight\n\n",

Users on X and Reddit largely seemed to consider the image as a sign to lock into trading markets.\n\nStocks related to Gill and other “meme stocks,” surged. GME prices were up as high as 44% in pre-market trading, and surged as high as 100% on market open before trading was halted.

Some microcap cat-themed meme coins such as kitty (KITTY) rose thousands of percent, while larger tokens popcat (POPCAT) and mog (MOG) rose over 15%. Larger-cap meme coins (DOGE) and (SHIB) were higher by 5% and 7%, respectively.\n\nData shows that opportunistic developers issued a slew of tokens referring to Gill, TheRoaringKitty, GameStop, and “stonks” – a meme term for stocks—in the past 24 hours.\n\nGill’s analysis of the video game retailer GameStop on Reddit, starting in 2019 and gaining traction during the COVID pandemic, created a viral phenomenon at the time. It was largely cited as a driving factor in the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021 as several small-time traders banded together and purchased options and leveraged shares of the company.\n\nThe stock rose from $4 to over $120 in a month and, at its peak, was up thousands of percent from its lifetime low of 64 cents in April 2020.\n\nGill’s initial $53,000 investment was worth nearly $50 million at its peak, emerging as a rags-to-riches story of a lone trader making a fortune from his bedroom by betting against hedge funds. One of the most prolific losers was Melvin Capital, a fund that lost billions of dollars betting on the decline of meme stocks, among other bets that move against it.\n\n",

    "title": "Why William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s Price",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Recently released emails from former SEC director William Hinman have rallied the XRP troops, but the documents are not a smoking gun.\n\n",
    "content": "On June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC\u0027s lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nVery broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly.\n\nRipple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators.\n\nEarly analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails’ release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front.\n\nAhead of the documents’ release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn’t a security if it is “sufficiently decentralized.” That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is “sufficiently decentralized” and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman.\n\nCritics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token – and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security.\n\nRipple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called “Ripple” even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders “gifted” 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as “Ripple.”\n\nRead More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency?\n\nTo critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of “decentralization theater.” And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures.\n\nIn any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple\u0027s side of the case, XRP\u0027s price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.\n\nSee Also: Ripple Does Not Care Whether XRP Is “Sufficiently Decentralized”\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The social application was one of the biggest blockchain-based platforms by revenue for a short period last year before usage dropped off. A new version is bringing the hype back.\n\nFriend.Tech, a blockchain-based social application that allows crypto personalities on X to issue shares for access to closed group chats, has seen a resurgence in activity and value locked.\n\nRecent developments, including a possible FRIEND token and expansion beyond X, have renewed interest in the platform.\n\nMore than $7 million has flowed into the platform in anticipation of the developments.\n\n",
    "content": "Money is flowing back into social application Friend.Tech as a new version teases an eventual airdrop, bringing users back to what was among the biggest revenue-generating platforms during the bear market.\n\nOver $7 million flowed to Friend.Tech last week after months of outflows, boosting the value locked to nearly $40 million, data shows. Weekly fees have crossed $1.3 million for the first time since November, making the platform over $600,000 in revenue.\n\nBuilt on Base, a layer-2 network, Friend.Tech lets crypto personalities on X issue “shares” for access to a closed group chat. For users, the allure of these chats is that their owners could offer trading insights, token picks or access to seed-funding deals – which raises the value of the shares.\n\nThe bump in activity precedes the coming of version 2 of the application, which developers said will be released after April 20. A key element of the update is expanding the platform beyond X to attract newer users.\n\nOver the weekend, developers also teased a FRIEND token. Expectations among users are that these could be distributed based on how many points – a reward for Friend.Tech usage – they accumulate before the token release.\n\nFriend.tech was earning in excess of $1 million per day in fees at its August peak after going viral on X and gaining more than 100,000 unique users, a significant number for crypto application standards. Shares of some crypto X personalities, such as @Cobie and @HsakaTrades, jumped to as much as three ether, or nearly $5,000, at the time.\n\nActivity fell off in the months following as the initial allure wore off. Security risks later marred the platform alongside opportunities elsewhere in the sector, leading to months of outflows since November.\n\n",

    "content": "The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act would hurt investors and hamper the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u0027s work, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said Wednesday.\n\n\"The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (\u0027FIT 21\u0027) would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk,\" he said.\n\nFIT21 is a joint bill produced by the House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, and is intended to clarify how the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversee crypto. It creates a \"digital commodity\" term for digital assets that do not meet the bill\u0027s definition of a security, placing those assets under the CFTC\u0027s purview.\n\nAccording to Gensler, FIT21 ignores long-standing precedent for how investment contracts are regulated, puts the agency into a tough position for certifying self-proclaimed digital commodity issuers, ignores Supreme Court precedent in the Howey Test, removes investor protections and potentially allows investors to take on excessive risk without appropriate disclosures.\n\nU.S. securities laws were developed after the Great Depression to protect consumers by forcing disclosures and giving both the regulator and investors tools to safeguard customers, Gensler said. Crypto industry participants have not been willing to comply with these regulations, he said.\n\n\"The bill would remove investment contracts that are recorded on a blockchain from\n\nthe statutory definition of securities and the time-tested protections of much of the federal\n\nsecurities laws,\" he said. \"By removing this set of investment contracts from the statutory list of securities, the bill implies what courts have repeatedly ruled – but what crypto market participants have attempted to deny – that many crypto assets are being offered and sold as securities under existing law.\"\n\nWhile the bill includes a provision for companies to self-certify that they\u0027re issuing \"digital commodities,\" it gives the SEC 60 days to assess whether those assets meet the bill\u0027s definition of a digital commodity. That is not enough time given just how many digital assets are circulating, he said.\n\nGensler also took aim at how the bill defined a digital commodity, saying it ignored the Howey Test precedent and the economic realities of assets. Between that, the investor protection framework the bill sets in place for crypto investors and the exclusion of exchanges, the bill may \"increase risk to the American public,\" he said.\n\nFIT21 might also harm the U.S.\u0027s broader capital markets, Gensler said, by letting companies try to avoid SEC oversight by using some sort of decentralized network.\n\nThe House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill later on Wednesday, though it does not currently have a clear road through the Senate and is unlikely to become a law this year.\n\n",

    "type": "article",
    "summary": "More people are calling for crypto companies and those behind products such as stablecoins to prove they have enough funds to pay their customers.\n\n",
    "content": "Regular banks do not actually hold all of your money. They lend out most of your deposits in an attempt to eke out returns from financial markets. This works, for the most part, because the bank insures deposits with the federal government and because the bank widely diversifies its exposure to risk to ensure that it won’t be caught short in the event of a financial crash.\n\nThis system occasionally fails in traditional finance (see: Lehman) but fails frequently in crypto. The government does not insure deposits to crypto platforms and the platforms often do not manage risk particularly well (see: FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network), making high-risk bets that end in catastrophe.\n\nRead More: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?\n\nAfter so many platforms squandered customer funds, crypto traders are thinking twice about depositing funds to crypto exchanges and lending institutions that “rehypothecate” uninsured deposits – which means they repurpose customer money and lend the funds out in the markets. A safer bet looks like trading on platforms that “fully back” their reserves. But what does this really mean, and should such claims be taken with a pinch of salt?\n\nWhen a financial product, such as a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to “fully back” its reserves, it means that it has stored enough money behind a product, like a stablecoin or a customer’s trading account, to support its worth.\n\nSo, a crypto exchange that “fully backs” its reserves should always be able to pay out customer withdrawals, no matter the state of the market. One such example is Coinbase, which does not lend out its customers’ funds without their express permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to prevent a bank run.\n\nA stablecoin that “fully backs” its reserves is always able to fulfill conversions to the original asset, no matter what. One example is wBTC, or wrapped bitcoin, which holds real bitcoin (BTC) in a cold wallet, then issues an equal amount of an Ethereum-based version of the coin that trades as an ERC-20 token.\n\nFully backed, however, does not necessarily mean that assets are held one to one. That claim refers to the idea that if you, say, give me a dollar, I’ll hold that dollar as a dollar and won’t turn it into something else. Lots of stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like U.S.-dollar stablecoin USDC, are not backed one to one.\n\nThis is because the companies that issue USDC hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in “cash and cash equivalents.” Cash equivalents refer to U.S. Treasury bonds, which is debt issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. These bonds, which pay small returns to holders over time, are close enough to the worth of actual U.S. dollars that the market accepts bonds being essentially worth the same.\n\nBut “fully backed” does not always mean that the backing can withstand financial shocks. U.S. dollar stablecoin tether (USDT) also claims that its reserves are fully backed, but this backing is secured by “other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether [the issuing company] to third parties.” So, USDT may be fully backed, but it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies.\n\nUntil October 2022, USDT was also backed by commercial paper – short-term commercial debt to other companies – and moved those funds to U.S. Treasurys. The concern about the commercial paper was that nobody knew which companies Tether was using to back USDT, so it was impossible to determine the worth of that backing. What’s more, its “fully backed” claim has historically turned out not to be true after it emerged in 2019 that USDT was, at one point, only 74% backed. As wrote the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u0027s Dawn D. Stump, the claim that it was backed to the U.S. dollar was “not 100% true, 100% of the time.”\n\nRead more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its Value\n\nSome stablecoins do not fully back their reserves, which has led to catastrophic results in some cases. The popular algorithmic stablecoin UST, for instance, crashed in spectacular fashion, wiping billions from the market.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, meaning it has more than enough crypto on hand to back its coin. DAI has survived several market crashes.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "At CoinDesk, we’re not just chronicling the business model transformation that digital assets and the blockchain have made possible – we’re actively participating in it.\n\nAt Consensus 2021, a virtual event, we beta-tested DESK, an experiment in using tokenized rewards to incentivize engagement and community-building, garnering positive feedback from our audience. At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019.\n\nIn December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com.\n\nRead More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader Experience\n\nBelow is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information.\n\nDESK is CoinDesk’s social token.\n\nDESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content.\n\nDESK’s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together.\n\nAs of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include:\n\nAt Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as:\n\nDESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum.\n\nPolygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction.\n\nYou’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners.\n\nRead more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your Wallet\n\nYes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account.\n\nIn the Web2 era, content creators – be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers – have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines).\n\nWe’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms.\n\nWe believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal.\n\nWe hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event.\n\nSocial tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants.\n\nInitially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward.\n\nSimply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience.\n\nNo. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone’s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity.\n\nIt is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading.\n\nBy providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We\u0027ve seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization.\n\nNo. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users.\n\nNo. See above.\n\nNo. We\u0027re not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement.\n\nListing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use.\n\nIt’s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests.\n\nSo, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether.\n\nPart of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground.\n\nNo. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless.\n\nCoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon.\n\nBecause DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK\u0027s beta testers.\n\nPiranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept.\n\nAt Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk’s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike.\n\nCoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others.\n\nAs mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used.\n\nNavigate to the DESK dashboard. Select \"Create or Connect Wallet\" and approve the transaction in your wallet.\n\nDepends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com.

    "summary": "Some traders expect ether prices to reach as high as $4,000 in the coming days, with odds of an ether ETF approval raised to 75%.\n\nRenewed hopes for U.S.-listed ether ETFs drive the crypto market higher and liquidate bearish short positions.\n\nBloomberg analysts raised the approval odds to 75%, boosting market sentiment.\n\n",
    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) surged over $71,000 early Tuesday, its highest since early April, as ether surged over 19% to $3,700 after Bloomberg analysts raised the probability that spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) gets approved in the U.S. to 75%.\n\nOther majors chalked out relatively smaller gains, with XRP, Cardano\u0027s ADA, Solana\u0027s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) rising between 3-6%, as per CoinGecko data.\n\nThe sudden move up caused over $260 million in market-wide short liquidations, the biggest since Feb.28. Ether shorts lost over $115 million, followed by bitcoin shorts at just over $99 million, Coinglass data shows.\n\nCrypto exchange Binance logged over $130 million in liquidations, the largest among counterparts, followed by OKX at $118 million and Huobi at $51 million.\n\nShorts are bets against higher price movements. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader\u0027s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader\u0027s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).\n\nMarkets started to rally late Monday as Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised the odds of a spot ether ETF to 75% from the early 20%. Later, CoinDesk reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked aspiring ether exchange-traded fund exchanges to update 19b-4 filings ahead of a key deadline this week.\n\nMarket participants consider the approval of an ether ETF to be a bullish event, opening the floodgates to institutional capital. The spot bitcoin ETF, which started trading in January, has racked up $12 billion in total inflows for BTC, with top trading firms and state funds among its holders.\n\nMeanwhile, some traders expect ether prices to rise further in the coming days.\n\n“Our view is that it is unlikely that spot can settle here, with approval taking us closer to 4k and denial back to 3k,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast. “Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis, suggesting approval is imminent.”\n\n",

Below we look at how these benefits can provide advantages to companies adopting blockchain tech beyond pure financial applications.\n\nYou\u0027re reading Crypto Long \u0026 Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nTransparency: There’s a common misconception that blockchain technology lacks transparency. In reality, it is inherently transparent, thanks to a decentralized ledger system. Each transaction is recorded on a public ledger, enabling quick and easy identi?cation of affected products. This transparency enhances accountability and trust in supply chains, ensuring consumer safety and product integrity.\n\nSimplicity: While blockchain technology may seem complex at ?rst glance, businesses can bene?t from simpli?ed explanations and practical applications. By focusing on real-world case studies and actionable insights, organizations that are using data science like GE, IBM, PayPal, AWS, Uber, John Deere, NASA and others have grasped data-driven insights across various sectors and its potential to streamline operations, enhance security, and drive innovation.\n\nGlobal Adoption: Blockchain is revolutionizing industry applications ranging from supply chain management and healthcare to voting systems and digital identity veri?cation. For example, AWS introduced Track and Trace with Amazon Managed Blockchain, a fully-managed service that automatically scales to meet the demands of thousands of applications running millions of transactions. Added benefits to leveraging supply chains with blockchain include scalability, cost reduction, transparency and ease of process automation.\n\nSustainability: Some major companies are leveraging blockchains for sustainability and fair treatment of workers purposes. In recent news, Mondele?z International, the parent to brands like Oreo, Ritz, Clif Bar, Cadbury, and Toblerone, announced that it’s joining the Hedera Council, the entity that governs the Hedera Network, “a sustainable public ledger for the decentralized economy.” By tapping Web3 tech, the Council expects Mondele?z to increase business efficiency and sustainability and innovate across customer engagement.\n\nConclusion: It\u0027s not too late to explore the vast opportunities in the blockchain space. As the industry continues to evolve and mature, early adopters stand to bene?t from investment opportunities, technological advancements, and market growth. Blockchain tech holds immense potential beyond ?nance, offering transparency, security, and e?ciency across various industries. By dispelling myths, embracing opportunities, and staying informed, businesses can harness the power of blockchain to drive innovation, foster trust, and achieve sustainable growth.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\n",

    "content": "The price of ether (ETH) has a 20% chance of rallying to $5,000 by the end of next month, data from the decentralized options marketplace Lyra indicates. The price peaked at $4,692 during the previous bull market, according to CoinDesk data.\n\nTo hit the new record, ether would need to rise by about a third from the current level around $3,740. That would follow this week\u0027s more than 20% surge spurred by sudden optimism that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\n\"Lyra options markets are implying a ~20% chance of ETH reaching $5,000 by June 28,\" Nick Forster, Lyra\u0027s founder and a former Wall Street options trader, told CoinDesk in an email. \"There is a 20% chance of ETH moving above $5,500 by July 26, as traders have increased positioning post the ETF speculation.\"\n\nLyra is a decentralized settlement protocol for spot, perpetuals and options trading. In the past 24 hours, the protocol registered a crypto options trading volume of $1.33 million, accounting for over 50% of the global decentralized finance (DeFi) options tally of $2.08 million, according to data source DeFiLlama. Traders from Lyra correctly predicted BTC\u0027s first-quarter rally and the April peak near $70,000.\n\nOptions are derivative contracts that give their holders the flexibility to buy or sell the underlying asset in the future at a price agreed upon today. A call gives the right to buy, and a put option offers the right to sell. Traders typically buy call options to profit from or hedge against price rallies and prefer puts when anticipating a price drop.\n\nThis week, Lyra-based traders have snapped up ether call options expiring in June and July at strikes above $5,000, revealing a bullish outlook.\n\n“The ETH ETF approval should have an outsized effect on ETH relative to Bitcoin. ETH is starting from a market cap that is roughly one-third of what Bitcoin\u0027s was prior to the ETF being priced in,\" Forster said. “This should drive more volumes to options as traders play the ETF approval event and position for volatile markets without being subject to liquidation (on the long side).\"\n\nThe bias for calls on Lyra is consistent with the activity on leading centralized exchanges like Deribit.\n\n",

    "title": "What Is \u0027Web5\u0027 and How Is it Different From Web3?",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "There are a few things that make Jack Dorsey’s vision for Web5 distinct, including not wanting to completely replace Web2 but work with it.\n\n",
    "content": "The world is still getting its collective head around Web3 – a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls \"Web5\"?\n\nIt turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey’s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises “an extra decentralized web platform.”\n\nTo land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 \u003d 5.\n\nWeb5’s core idea is to “put you in control of your data and identity” – a core tenet of Web3’s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet’s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS.\n\nDorsey’s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data “captive in app silos,” Web5 pushes for “a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.”\n\nThere are three pillars at Web5’s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017.\n\nSo, what’s new here – apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey’s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any “special utility tokens or subjective consensus” that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service.\n\nIn doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin’s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5’s nascent community already balked at TBD’s attempt to trademark the term Web5.\n\nThe other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5’s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user’s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform.\n\nTBD’s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to “help her visualize her itinerary.” Again, the idea is to tie data that’s usually locked inside centralized services – something TBD calls “a massive, unworkable mess” – to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user’s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes.\n\nWill it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that’s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS).\n\nOne of the key things that distinguish TBD’s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it’s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5’s announcement: “Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It’s like a high school student saying ‘yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it’s meant to be.’ It’s naive.”\n\n",

    "content": "This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nBitcoin rose above $71,000 during the European morning after analysts saw the possibility of an ether ETF being approved in the U.S. improving. BTC has climbed nearly 6% in the last 24 hours, eclipsing $71,000 for the first time since early April. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which offers a broad measurement of the digital asset market, rose more than 8.5% while ETH jumped almost 20% to over $3,700. The market movements caused more than $260 million in short liquidations, the most since Feb. 28. Ether shorts lost over $115 million, followed by bitcoin shorts at just over $99 million, Coinglass data shows.\n\nETH has been buoyed by favorable regulatory developments that seem to indicate increasing chances of spot ether ETFs being approved by the SEC after the regulator asked exchanges to update 19b-4 filings, which propose rule changes. As a result, the ether implied volatility curve, which shows market expectations of future volatility across different strike prices and expirations, flattened as 25-delta risk reversals hit year-to-date highs above 18%, and traders heavily bought $4,000 calls for 24 May and 31 May, Presto Research analysts wrote. A Polymarket contract asking if an ether ETF would be approved by May 31 jumped from 10 cents to 55 cents, representing a 55% chance that approval will take place by then.\n\nMeme coins on the Ethereum ecosystem like MOG and PEPE surged on the increasing likelihood of ether ETFs being approved. Meme tokens are often seen as a leveraged way to bet on the growth of their underlying blockchain. MOG rose nearly 50% while PEPE climbed over 20%. “Established memes are generally high beta for the native token of the chain they’re on, and Mog has established itself as a winner on Ethereum,” Viro, a Mog core team member, said in an interview over Telegram. “I think the market sees that there’s quite a lot of room to catch up to Pepe, and that’s why you see the outperformance. If you think memes are good beta; you’ll go for the higher caps like pepe or you’ll slide further down the curve for mog.”\n\n- Omkar Godbole\n\n",

    "summary": "One trading desk has seen an uptick in call buying activity with targets of as high as $120,000 for December 2024.\n\nBitcoin’s price could reach $74,000 in the coming weeks amid softer U.S. inflation figures and institutional demand, which favors riskier assets.\n\nLarge asset managers like Millennium and Schonfeld have invested in bitcoin spot ETFs, indicating growing institutional interest.\n\nSelling pressure from short-term is easing, some on-chain analysts said in a Thursday report.\n\n",
    "content": "Bullish sentiment for riskier assets following soft inflation figures could propel bitcoin (BTC) prices toward the $74,000 mark in the coming days as institutional demand continues to grow, Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a note early Thursday.\n\nThe softer-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggering a breakout for BTC. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March.\n\nSuch a move, coupled with demand from traditional finance, could see bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,700.\n\n“We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of nearly $74,000,” QCP traders said. “The desk saw sizeable buyers of $100K-$120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot.”\n\n“Institutional demand for bitcoin continues to grow, with large asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld investing approximately 3% and 2% of their AUM into the BTC spot ETF,” they added.\n\nMultiple filings on Wednesday showed that several big-name funds, such as Millenium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios.\n\nMeanwhile, some analysts say the selling pressure on bitcoin appears to have eased off, citing on-chain and exchange data.\n\n“Short-term Bitcoin holders are selling at basically zero profit and traders are depleting their unrealized profits in the last few months,” CryptoQuant analysts shared in a Thursday report. “Bitcoin balances at OTC desks stabilizing, which suggests there is less Bitcoin supply coming into the market to sell via these entities.”\n\nThe firm defines short-term traders as addresses that hold bitcoin for less than 155 days and are likely to capitalize on short-term price movements.\n\nA breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility. Since March, the market has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000, with the halving event in April not providing the expected boost due to a general lack of market catalysts, traders have previously said.\n\nHigher risk appetite for token bets showed signs of beginning earlier this week after an X post by retail trader Keith Gill sent some meme stocks and meme coins surging.\n\nGill\u0027s online persona and investment strategies contributed to a short squeeze on video game retailer GameStop’s stock in 2021, and his first post on social application X in three years was considered by some to be a sign of market volatility in the months ahead.\n\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin’s (BTC) much anticipated halving event later this month could see a flurry of bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting upside on both technical and meme coin projects.\n\nHalving reduces the rate at which new coins are created and lowers the available new supply. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. This event has historically preceded a bull market for the token.\n\nCrypto traders say participants seek a “reason to buy” as money narratives continuously shift in the current bullish environment and they may turn their focus on the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming weeks.\n\n“There exists a large, untapped pool of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem that remains dormant, and surprisingly few listed assets that traders can use to gain exposure to the narrative,” the OTC desk of trading firm Wintermute told CoinDesk over email.\n\n“Should capital begin to rotate into the Bitcoin ecosystem, tokens like $RUNE, $STX, and $ORDI could benefit significantly and outperform,” they added.\n\nTHORChain’s RUNE and Stack’s STX have been among the top-performing tokens in the past year, CoinGecko data shows, tracking a bitcoin rise. Meme coin ordi (ORDI) – a nod to the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin – has surged over 2,500% since its September issuance.\n\nMeanwhile, Bartosz Lipinski is the founder of the crypto trading platform Cube.Exchange said in an email that meme coins and the upcoming Runes protocol could rile up risky bets in the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n“Ethereum’s high costs and significant network congestion will cause it to take a backseat as Bitcoin-based projects, like Rune, will redirect meme coin hype to the Bitcoin ecosystem because of the novelty,” Lipinski said. “The BRC-20 (Ordinals NFT) standard is likely to be overtaken by Runes, which is expected to launch on the day of the halving.”\n\n“Runes will aim to replace the standard with fungible tokens, which will enable the efficient creation of meme coins to compete with projects on Base and Solana,” he added, referring to the ongoing frenzy for non-serious tokens in the two ecosystems.\n\nOrdinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.\n\nOrdinal volumes were higher than those of usual leaders Ethereum and Solana in the past week, as reported, led by NodeMonkes and Pups. Non-fungible token (NFT) on other networks buying and selling activity declined 95% across all networks in the same period, suggestive of an isolated interest in Ordinals.\n\n",

The bill also suggested the White House would want to work with Congress on future legislation addressing the crypto markets, in contrast with previous statements from Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has repeatedly said he does not believe the industry needs additional legislation specific to crypto.\n\n\"The Administration is eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system,\" the statement said. \"H.R. 4763 in its current form lacks sufficient protections for consumers and investors who engage in certain digital asset transactions.\"\n\nThis is the second statement of administrative policy the administration has published in recent weeks, after threatening a veto against a bill looking to overturn controversial SEC accounting guidance. That bill sailed through the House and Senate.\n\nThe statement came hours after the SEC\u0027s Gensler published his own opposing statement on the legislation, saying it would harm the regulator\u0027s efforts to police traditional capital markets as well as crypto markets.\n\nFIT21 would redefine how securities issuers have to comply with existing federal law and Supreme Court precedent, the SEC chair said in his statement.\n\nThe bill\u0027s advocates say U.S. law doesn\u0027t allow for crypto companies to operate without the threat of civil litigation, a view Gensler described as these companies trying to get out of meeting disclosure and other compliance requirements for securities issuer.\n\nThe bill would create a new definition specific to digital assets, to identify when they\u0027re securities or digital commodities and whether the SEC or Commodity Futures Trading Commission should be the primary spot market regulator. The full House is set to take up the bill later Wednesday, with a vote scheduled for this afternoon.\n\n\"The Administration looks forward to continued collaboration with Congress on developing legislation for digital assets that includes adequate guardrails for consumers and investors while creating the conditions needed for innovation, and further time will be needed for such collaboration,\" the White House statement on Wednesday concluded.\n\nUPDATE (May 22, 2024, 14:47 UTC): Adds additional detail.\n\n",

    "title": "CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger on Overzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative Action",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "The commodities regulator has been clear about the dangers of regulating a burgeoning industry through enforcement actions.\n\n",
    "content": "Commissioner Summer Mersinger, of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is one of the few U.S. regulators who is routinely willing to defend the crypto industry and call out what she sees as overzealous oversight. She will be speaking at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas, on May 30.\n\nCoinDesk caught up with Mersinger to discuss the Cain and Abel rivalry between the CFTC and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), how her agency decides which enforcement actions to pursue and her views on a variety of issues, including the CME possibly getting into the spot bitcoin market, the emerging world of betting markets and Washington D.C. traffic.\n\nIs it an accurate view that the SEC and the CFTC are in somewhat of a turf war over crypto?\n\nI think there are certainly questions around who has the appropriate authority. There are people between the two agencies who are willing to work together, in fact, at Consensus Commissioner Peirce and I will be speaking together. We have some similar views. But it is a struggle because, sometimes where debate has been leveled – whether it\u0027s an enforcement case or another action we have said falls under our fraud and manipulation enforcement authority – we\u0027re seeing the SEC start to ask questions as though it falls under their jurisdiction. And so there is certainly some tension there. It’s largely the lack of clarity that\u0027s really causing the tension.\n\nYou\u0027re in a minority position as a regulator who’s somewhat favorable to crypto. Could you just explain why it is that you\u0027re willing to stick your neck out?\n\nPart of the reason I went into government, generally, is that – while there\u0027s a need for government in people\u0027s lives – we don\u0027t want to overstep. We also want to make sure the rules of the road are clear so that people can abide by the law. This is an area where there is a real problem. A lot of people are very interested in investing in, or trading, cryptocurrencies, and we have not provided any clarity – we\u0027ve made it very murky. That\u0027s not what the government should be doing. It’s creating a situation where you have people relying on the word of a regulator, and the rules of the game are being changed in the middle of the play.\n\nI still think it\u0027s important that we speak up and let people know that, whether you like crypto or not, that\u0027s not the point here. The point is that regulators have really made this confusing and difficult.\n\nDo you agree with Commissioner Pham’s idea that the Government Accountability Office should investigate the CFTC\u0027s enforcement actions?\n\nCOMMISSIONER MERSINGER: It’s difficult to ask another agency to come in and look at the internal workings of the CFTC. I understand where Commissioner Pham is coming from and I think it\u0027s that same kind of feeling that we shouldn\u0027t be regulating through enforcement. But I also think this is a leadership question. I greatly respect Chairman Behnam, but this is an issue with the political direction from this White House. So, instead of an audit, we need to ask: Is the problem the agency, or the current political leadership driving our agenda and broadly stifling financial innovation?\n\nI don\u0027t want to put words in your mouth, but is this to suggest that the regulatory landscape would improve if Trump was re-elected in November?\n\nThere are clear differences between President Biden and former President Trump, so that does drive the regulatory agenda. So, if leadership changes, you would certainly assume there would be new policies and a new regulatory agenda.\n\nI\u0027m curious to what extent you\u0027re in active dialogue with Congressmembers about potential crypto legislation?\n\nThey use us as a resource. We talk to members of the House Financial Services Committee, the Agriculture Committee, and certainly members of the Senate and work with them on where there is ambiguity in the laws or opportunities to make some delineations and clear paths for regulation. It’s offering our assistance and expertise and it’s helpful to have those conversations because they also want to make sure we\u0027re able to implement the laws that they pass. They may have great intentions, but if it\u0027s impossible for the agency to implement then it’s useless.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. Do you think that there needs to be bespoke crypto legislation or would new interpretations of existing laws suffice?\n\nThere are some who believe we can use current statutory authority, whether the SEC or the CFTC, to regulate – which is where we see regulation through enforcement actions. I disagree. The only way to get past just bringing enforcement actions is to have something come out of Congress that says “here\u0027s how to handle cryptocurrencies.”\n\nSee also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis)\n\nBeyond legislation, the two agencies also need to sit down and come up with some joint rulemaking. We did that with Dodd Frank, and we certainly could do that here. That’s an important piece of making sure people know which regulator is going to regulate them, which door to walk into. There\u0027s no question that without statutory changes to ensure it\u0027s very clear where the jurisdiction is, agencies will try to go in separate directions.\n\nI know every enforcement action is primarily driven by facts on the ground. But I think it might be interesting to get a view into how these cases are built. What is the process of building a case against someone like Avi Eisenberg?\n\nWithout talking about any specific enforcement cases, with a lot of these cases it\u0027s been whistleblower reports saying “I think somebody is violating the law.” It could be a victim who says they lost money, and I don\u0027t think what they\u0027re doing is legal. We have a pretty large team of enforcement investigators and attorneys who start building a case. By the time it gets to us at the commission, usually the facts have been pretty well established and how they line up with the law. We\u0027re kind of like a jury that decides whether the facts meet our statutory requirements.\n\nA lot of it is done by the enforcement team that might interview the whistleblower and other employees, get documents. A lot of time goes into each case before it gets to the commission for a vote. There\u0027s also a lot of cooperation between the various agencies, whether it\u0027s the DOJ, state regulators or the SEC. So where there\u0027s opportunities to bring cases under multiple statutes, or different regulators, they\u0027ll work together. It\u0027s more efficient for the government if they can work together. They can also tip each other off. If we had to get every lead, I think it\u0027d be really difficult.\n\nNow one distinction I want to make is you hear a lot of numbers around crypto enforcement cases. I think it\u0027s a little unfair because a lot of these cases are just run of the mill fraud; somebody stealing someone else\u0027s money, someone claiming to buy crypto, but not actually buying the crypto. So we\u0027ve seen this play out with whatever the hot topic is at the time. I\u0027d say every few years the theme changes – it was foreign currencies, it was metals, we saw a lot of gold fraud. Right now crypto is the hot thing. A lot of cases have been portrayed as cryptocurrency fraud, but it\u0027s just fraud with a crypto wrapper around it. So tomorrow, it might be AI fraud.\n\nI almost hate to say it, but given how much fraud centers around crypto, do you think that there should be more enforcement actions?\n\nI think when it\u0027s straight up fraud, yes. There\u0027s a distinction here when you have a case where somebody just takes your money and claims to invest in something and never does – there\u0027s no question who has the authority there. The more we can try to shut some of this down, the better.\n\nBut where there\u0027s a policy question around a certain activity and how our statute would fit with that activity, that\u0027s where I get a little nervous. For instance, if we\u0027re looking at a DeFi protocol, and we\u0027re saying they\u0027re violating our statute it can be difficult if we\u0027ve never really said how our statute applies to DeFi.\n\nWe’re starting to set out definitions and interpretations based on court cases, because sometimes you\u0027ll find use cases where there are bad actors. Sometimes it\u0027s people who want to abide by the law, but there\u0027s no clear way how they would do that. That\u0027s why I think we\u0027d be better off with rulemaking.\n\nWhat do you make of the argument that the SEC implicitly said that Ethereum is a commodity when futures went live in 2021?\n\nSo this is an interesting question in development. We do have futures products trading on ether. And I do think if somebody decides that ether is a security, it calls into question what happens. We\u0027ve [the CFTC] been regulating those contracts. They operated well, we have no concerns. This was an area where we thought there was clarity, and now we\u0027re not quite sure if there\u0027s clarity and that\u0027s dangerous.\n\nThe law is a little strange; commodities can be a lot of other things – you can have a commodity that is a security. The nomenclature gets a little tricky the way the law is written. But we\u0027ve said we believe this is a commodity and we\u0027re going to regulate it as such under CFTC jurisdiction because it is a derivative product. To me that has been clearly laid out and we shouldn\u0027t be introducing new kinds of questions around what has been a clear policy.\n\nGiven how interrelated these assets are, do you think the U.S. would be better off with a single unified agency, like the U.K.’s FCA?\n\nI\u0027m always hesitant to recommend any new government agencies or adding more government. History has shown that more government has never been the answer. But I do think sometimes you\u0027ve got to better tailor statutes. Crypto doesn\u0027t neatly fit into any of our financial categories, so we\u0027re gonna have to fine tune some of the law. That\u0027s what Congress does, so we can easily do this without any new agency.\n\nWhy is the CFTC so against betting markets?\n\nIt\u0027s a very tough, difficult topic because there\u0027s a lot of nuance. So these markets, which we call event contracts, are part of our statute that was added under the Dodd Frank Act. In the grand scheme of things, it\u0027s relatively new, but we\u0027ve seen interest in these contracts for quite some time and it\u0027s certainly ramping up. The way Congress laid it out for us it said these contracts generally are OK, as long as they don\u0027t touch on a number of topics, like gaming, war, terrorism, assassination – anything that\u0027s against federal law. There are a number of people who really don\u0027t like election contracts and would like to include them in this list.\n\nThen there\u0027s this public interest piece that tries to determine whether having this contract would be against the public interest. It\u0027s not necessarily that we are against these markets, but there have to be some guardrails. Congress directed us to have some guardrails, and we’re trying to build them. You see that with our recent vote. My feeling is if that\u0027s the route you want to take, you still have to do a public interest determination for every contract, which is why I dissented because we were limiting elections as a category.\n\nSee also: \u0027What Are We Waiting for\u0027? SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce on Crypto Regulation\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to create a framework where if you\u0027re registered with us, you won’t have a legal question every time you try to do something new. We are just struggling a little bit with the approach. Congress tried to help us create clarity, but certainly left a lot of a lot left to the regulator to figure out.\n\nThe Financial Times reported today that CME is thinking about listing spot bitcoin trading, not not just bitcoin futures. Is that something that you are supportive of?\n\nYou know, the first time I heard about it was this morning as well, so I haven\u0027t had those conversations. I want to talk a little bit more with CME and with our staff to find out what this means. There\u0027s a lot of questions around custody and other issues. So right now, I don\u0027t have a positive or negative opinion and honestly, as a regulator, I shouldn\u0027t. They should be able to make those market decisions as long as they\u0027re following the rules. We try to be a regulator that is principles based and let our registered entities run the markets, because that\u0027s what they do. Our job is just to make sure everyone\u0027s following the rules.\n\nQuick round of overrated/underrated? You could decline to answer or clarify your position. DeFi?\n\nI don\u0027t have a position one way or the other. I just think as a regulator, we should have clear rules of the road for DeFi.\n\nWashington D.C.?\n\nYou know, I\u0027m gonna say Washington D.C. is a little overrated. Mostly because I was just in the Midwest where there was no traffic. It was very pleasant.\n\nGary Gensler?\n\nNeutral. You know, I\u0027ve never met him. So I try to withhold my opinions of people until I\u0027ve had a chance to sit down and get to know them.\n\nThe phrase “sufficiently decentralized?”\n\nYou\u0027re either decentralized or you\u0027re not. So I think sufficiently decentralized feels a little overrated because I don\u0027t know what that means. It probably means you\u0027re not decentralized.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to at Consensus?\n\nThe conversations with so many different stakeholders. This is an opportunity to talk with people we ordinarily wouldn’t see in Washington, D.C. and to have them all in one place is really special.\n\nThank you again for the time. Nice to meet you both.\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you.\n\n",

    "summary": "By approving bitcoin as an underlying product within the ETF space, the SEC has reduced risk at the base level of the asset, BitGo\u0027s Steve Scott writes. The only question is now will they invest?\n\n",
    "content": "As anticipated, the rollout of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. market has made a massive positive impact on the digital asset industry. It’s unleashed a stampede of retail investors, and set records for investment into bitcoin (BTC) and into ETFs.\n\nMore importantly, being in a product approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has changed the risk reward ratio for bitcoin, bringing crypto back into the institutional investment conversation. That’s driving new interest from some firms and emboldening others to restart projects that had been put on pause. The door into the mainstream financial system has been reopened.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nInstitutional investors think about risk in many dimensions, with some being: products, counterparties and the risks around the underlying asset itself. In traditional finance (TradFi), all of these are well understood.\n\nThe products have become commoditized, with many firms offering similar products. The counterparties – the market makers, custodians, clearinghouses, etc. that help absorb trading risk are well known. The different asset classes are also well understood and there are time honored ways of evaluating the risks of a particular asset.\n\nOver many years a lot of the risk and volatility has been taken out of the system. It’s black swan type events that create problems. The risk is low but so are the rewards. Opportunities to beat the market are hard to find.\n\nWhat we’ve seen in crypto is a series of events that have had a negative impact, but are foreseeable given the industry’s lack of regulation and controls. The risk of these events happening has been too high for institutions to go after the outsized rewards.\n\nThe bitcoin ETFs reduce risk across all three dimensions.\n\nETFs have been available in the U.S. market for over 30 years. Everyone understands the product. Buying the asset in a securitized product is more straightforward than buying spot bitcoin outright. Many investors feel it’s a better path to pay a management fee to have someone else handle custody, settlement risk, and other operational aspects of trading Bitcoin. They no longer have to take those risks directly.\n\nThe presence of big brand names like BlackRock, Fidelity and others reduces counterparty risk. There are plenty of crypto native custodians, liquidity providers and market makers, but they are relatively unknown in the world of TradFi.\n\nSee also: Bitcoin ETFs Also Owned by Steven Cohen\u0027s Point72\n\nThe ETFs introduce some of the reliant counterparties within the crypto universe to general investors. Knowing that big TradFi players have done the due diligence on their financials, processes and procedures and security practices reduces the fear factor. Not only that, it shows them who they could go to for help if they wanted to hold bitcoin and other digital assets and do spot trading themselves in the future.\n\nBy approving bitcoin as an underlying product within the ETF space, the SEC has reduced risk at the base level of the asset – namely, the fear that crypto could be entirely banned in the U.S., obviously greater regulatory clarity could reduce asset risk further, but market demand for ETFs has pushed the agency to settle some important questions. It has also pushed ETF issuers to put in place many of the plain vanilla elements that reduce risk that institutional players expect to see.\n\nAll of these elements create trust in the market, which is crucial for resuming digital assets’ journey into the mainstream. There’s a lot of ideology, jargon and technical terms surrounding crypto. But essentially it\u0027s just another asset class that uses a different technology.\n\nPrior to FTX, a lot of people put those risks aside and focus on price appreciation and gaining access to the market. Post FTX, people are saying, I want to be involved, but I need to know I\u0027m protected at a basic level. The ETFs do that, while exposing institutional investors to the reliant counterparties in crypto. They’ve put the industry back on a positive track.\n\nSee also: Bitcoin ETF Holdings Disclosed by Morgan Stanley\n\nThere are two things keeping institutions away from digital assets right now. One is philosophical. They don’t believe in or like Bitcoin or crypto. Then there is a second camp for whom the risk/reward ratio still isn’t attractive enough. For these people, the success of the ETFs is making it increasingly difficult to sit on the sidelines, especially when clients are asking for crypto products.\n\nThe day will come where the main risk with Bitcoin and other digital assets is at the base level of asset performance – just as it is in TradFi. It isn’t going to be one ruling or one product that magically makes it happen. It’s going to be a long process, but eventually all the questions about products and counterparties and regulations will fade away.\n\nThe only question will be, do you want to invest in digital assets, or not?\n\n",

    "title": "Binance Crypto Exchange: Your Questions Answered",
    "type": "article",
    "summary": "Following the SEC charges against the world’s largest crypto exchange, people are wondering what’s the difference between Binance and Binance.us, who is Changpeng Zhao and more.\n\n",
    "content": "Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who is often referred to as just “CZ,” Binance is the world\u0027s leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of June 2023. The company was originally based in China but had to leave Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions shortly after its launch.\n\nBinance developed its own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (later renamed to BNB Chain), which facilitates trades on the exchange. The native token of the blockchain is Binance coin (BNB) and the company has also launched a stablecoin, BinanceUSD (BUSD). Because of U.S. regulatory rules, Binance created a supposedly separate company for its U.S. clients in 2019, Binance.US.\n\nOn June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US as well as CZ, who serves as Binance CEO, on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering BNB and BUSD to the general public, calling them unregistered securities. The SEC lawsuit also casts fresh doubt on the independence of the company’s U.S. arm and its staking service.\n\nRead more about the SEC suit here\n\nThis is not Binance’s first battle with U.S. regulators. Binance is also under ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who sued CZ and Binance in March 2023, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao.\n\nCZ is a well-known personality in crypto, actively engaging with the crypto community through Twitter and speaking at conferences and to the media. As for his origins, he was born in China and emigrated to Canada when he was 12 and says he is a Canadian citizen. In high school, he worked part-time at McDonald’s, which is part of his well-known lore. He graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science.\n\nAfter college, he worked for the Tokyo stock exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook developing software for the businesses. He then founded a startup in 2005, Fusion Systems, which focused on creating an automated high-frequency trading platform. Following that, he worked for several crypto startups including a stint as co-founder and CTO of OKCoin. Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.\n\nAccording to the white paper, Zhao\u0027s goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support.\n\nShortly after Binance’s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper.\n\nBinance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China’s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance’s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based.\n\nBinance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance\u0027s proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange.\n\nBinance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance’s services.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange.\n\nThe other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees.\n\nFinally, unlike Binance’s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange.\n\nJuly 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO.\n\nJuly 2018: Binance acquires Trust Wallet, a free, non-custodial mobile wallet to support its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) offering.\n\nJanuary 2019: Binance starts to offer support for new token listings through ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings), through its Launchpad product.\n\nApril 2019: Binance migrates BNB from Ethereum to its proprietary chain, then called Binance Smart Chain (now rebranded to Binance chain or BNB chain)\n\nApril 2019: Binance launches its DEX ahead of schedule.\n\nMay 2019: Binance gets hacked for the first time. Hackers steal over 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) from Binance (the equivalent of roughly $41 million at the time). Zhao quickly took to social media to reassure users that no one lost funds and that Binance used its reserve funds to cover the costs of the stolen crypto.
