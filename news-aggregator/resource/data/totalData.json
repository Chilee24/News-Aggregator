    "content": "Bitcoin recently rose above $66,000 for the first time since April. This recent price rally from the flagship crypto is believed to be due to several factors, including the recently released inflation data. Inflation Data Comes In Lower Than Expectations The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data was announced on May 15 and came in lower than expected. The CPI rose by 0.3% in April, against forecasts of 0.4%. The CPI data was also lower than those recorded in March and February, when inflation rose by 0.4%. Related Reading How High Can The XRP Price Go? Crypto Analyst Unveils 6-Month Prediction 4 days ago Therefore, the latest inflation data suggests that inflation in the US might be slowing down. This development has provided some relief for investors, as the Fed is likely to maintain a dovish stance and consider rate cuts as inflation looks to decline. Lower interest rates mean investors will be more confident investing in risk assets like Bitcoin. Another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s rally is recent reports showing that some notable institutions are heavily invested in the flagship crypto. Bitcoinist reported that the State of Wisconsin has invested almost $99 million in BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF. Hedge Fund Millenium Management is also reported to hold $1.94 billion across five different Spot Bitcoin ETF products. This presents a bullish outlook for Bitcoin as it suggests that institutional investors are interested in the crypto token for the long term. Meanwhile, from a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin also looked primed for this rally, with crypto analyst Rekt Capital revealing that the flagship crypto was out of the post-halving “Danger Zone.” Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also noted that Bitcoin was displaying a cup and reversal pattern on the weekly chart and added that the “breakout will be explosive and will send it to a cycle top.” What Next For Bitcoin? In a Telegram update, crypto trading firm QCP Capital stated that they expect this bullish momentum to take Bitcoin’s price to the previous highs of $74,000. They highlighted activity in the derivatives market and growing institutional demand as factors that could contribute to Bitcoin’s rise to this price level. They also raised the possibility of this being the resumption of the bull market, stating that “the stars seem to be aligning on this breakout with significant sovereign and institutional adoption, abating inflation and upcoming US elections.” The trading firm added, “If this is indeed the start of the bull trend again, then this move could take us past all-time highs.” Related Reading Ethereum Bull Flag Breakout: ATH On The Horizon As Major Metrics Turn Bullish 4 days ago Rekt Capital suggested that this might be the beginning of an upward trend for the flagship crypto as he revealed that the daily downtrend for Bitcoin is over.

Despite the broader crypto market rally, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) gaining 69% and 53% QoQ, respectively, OP’s market cap ranking slipped from 26th to 39th among all blockchain networks. However, within the Ethereum ecosystem, OP remains one of the top four rollups by market capitalization. OP’s circulating market cap growth during Q1.

Related Reading Expert Sets Timeline For When Ethereum Price Will Begin Rally To $10,000 2 days ago The network’s revenue also saw a substantial 78% QoQ increase to $16 million, driven by higher activity and a 48% rise in the average transaction fee to $0.42. However, this average fee dropped significantly in the latter half of March due to the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which reduced L1 submission costs by 99%. Total Value Locked Jumps 18% In Q1 Despite the fee reduction, Optimism’s on-chain profit for Q1 2024 increased 14% QoQ to $2 million. The network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) also grew by 18% to $1.2 billion, though its TVL ranking among all networks fell to 11th place. Within Optimism’s TVL, the DeFi sector dominated, accounting for 86% of active addresses. According to Messari, non-fungible token (NFT) applications and gaming followed with 6.9% and 6.7%, respectively. TVL’s leading protocols included Synthetix ($307 million, +4% QoQ), Aave ($270 million, +52% QoQ), and Velodrome ($171 million, +10% QoQ). Optimism’s stablecoin market capitalization also grew significantly, reaching $809 million (+32% QoQ) by the end of Q1 2024. Circle’s USDC stablecoin and Tether’s USDT made up most of this, with USDT seeing a 64% QoQ surge to $512 million, or 63% of the total stablecoin market cap on Optimism. OP’s stablecoin market cap performance. Source: Messari OP Rebounds Alongside Crypto Market Resurgence Despite Optimism’s strong performance across key metrics in Q1 2024, the network’s native token, OP, did not see a corresponding price increase at the end of Q1. Instead, OP followed the broader market downtrend, hitting an annual low of $1.80 just one month after hitting an all-time high of $4.84 in March. However, OP has followed suit as the overall cryptocurrency market has seen a resurgence of bullish momentum in the past few days. In the past 24 hours, the token has recorded a 9% price increase and a 3% uptick in the past week, currently trading at $2.56.

The first key resistance is at $2.65, followed by $2.90, which must be overcome before the token can push towards the $3.00 level.

Scaramucci emphasized that institutional BTC adoption is unfolding rapidly, and he anticipates more pension funds will pursue Bitcoin investments. He pointed out that regulatory approvals have opened the doors for large-scale institutional participation in BTC. This endorsement will make Bitcoin a staple in these institutions’ long-term asset allocation strategies. According to Scaramucci, understanding Bitcoin and the history of money is key to recognizing its potential.

In a new X post on Saturday, the veteran analyst takes a deeper dive explaining the reasons behind his advocacy for altcoins investment ahead of a highly expected crypto bull run. Related Reading Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run 2 days ago Investing In Altcoins Is The Best, Analyst Says Why In his most recent bullish prediction on altcoins, van de Poppe begins by stating these tokens may not present as the most ideal investment especially considering that their combined value is down by 70% against Bitcoin in the last three months. The analyst has attributed this poor performance to several factors including a delay in network updates and an extended bear market. In addition, van de Poppe also notes Ethereum’s current struggles to be a significant contributor to this market downturn. He explains that typically the crypto bullish hype moves from Bitcoin to Ethereum, followed by tokens with big market cap, then middle-cap tokens and small-cap tokens. However, this cycle appears to be experiencing some delay due to a bearish cloud over Ethereum, driven by uncertainty over the approval of a proposed spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) as well as its asset class. Nevertheless, van de Poppe believes this delay to be quite temporary as he postulates that market traders are currently pricing in any potential negative effect from the denial of an Ethereum Spot ETF or the classification of the prominent altcoin as a security. Once Ethereum embarks on a bullish course, van de Poppe predicts other altcoins to follow suit. The analyst projects that certain tokens could record a 1000% gain as seen between October 2023-February 2024, amid the hype around Bitcoin spot ETFs. However, the analyst nudges investors to buy into the altcoin market now during the period of “lowest confidence”. He believes such an act is similar to investing in Bitcoin at $3,700 at the start of 2020, thus ensuring investors generate maximum profits in the coming bull run. Related Reading Floki Inu Frenzy: Memecoin Eyes New Highs As Open Interest Soars 1 day ago Ethereum ETF Approval In The Balance As weeks continue to progress, the approval of an Ethereum spot ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears highly uncertain. This sentiment is driven by the Commission’s ongoing deliberation on whether to classify Ethereum as a security as well as a lack of dialogue between the agency and prospective issuers. The next deadline dates are for May 23/May 24, during which the SEC will respond to 2 ETF applications with many analysts expecting further delays from the Commission.

    "content": "For analysts and investors alike, comprehending the variables that influence price action in the complex world of cryptocurrency markets is essential. Ali Martinez, a well-known cryptocurrency expert, has recently provided insights into the fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin by applying the basic economic theory of supply and demand. Understanding Bitcoin Prices Through Supply And Demand It is worth noting that any asset’s price movement, including cryptocurrencies, is determined by the fundamental rules of supply and demand. An asset’s price tends to decrease when supply outpaces demand, while prices typically increase when supply cannot keep up with demand. Related Reading The Hidden Forces Behind Bitcoin Price: Latest Insights From On-Chain Data 2 days ago Thus, Ali Martinez has deduced the crypto asset’s price and holders’ behaviour by applying the method and other on-chain metrics. Martinez’s analysis demonstrates how fluctuations in the market’s buying interest and the availability of Bitcoin are key factors influencing its price trajectory. According to Martinez, Bitcoin’s Realized Cap witnessed a significant increase mid-way through March when BTC hit a new all-time high of $73,000. This indicated that the majority of BTC’s long-term holders were likely yielding gains at the time. As a result, several investors sold their holdings, which led to a sharp rise in realized profits. Following realized profits in March, long-term holders felt safe adding over 70,000 BTC to their investments at these prices. BTC Realized Cap spike in mid-March | Ali Martinez on X Meanwhile, when the market’s growing supply of Bitcoin exceeded demand, the coin saw a substantial correction from the $73,000 level to the $57,000 level. Given that short-term holders are more likely to sell their holdings due to price volatility, this decline took Bitcoin below its realized price for short-term holders, inciting fear in the market. However, despite investors’ concerns, the short-term holder’s Realized Price at the $65,500 level acted as an accumulation point. On the basis of this principle, Martinez believes the likelihood of Bitcoin continuing its upward trajectory will only increase when demand for the cryptocurrency starts to exceed the supply of BTC accessible in the market. Using BTC On Exchanges To Support The Principles Martinez has underscored that the available BTC on crypto exchanges can be used to confirm these supply and demand laws. He further noted that over 30,000 BTC have been moved to private wallets for long-term storage in May, indicating confidence among holders in the potential worth of Bitcoin. Related Reading Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Accumulating Like In 2021: Is BTC Ready For A 15X? 6 days ago Observing Bitcoin’s price using the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, Martinez cited a retracement above the +0.5? pricing band at $64,600. Such an upswing has historically caused BTC to test the pricing range of 1.0?, which is backed by increasing demand. Meanwhile, this price range at the moment is roughly lingering at $77,000. Presently, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $66,275, indicating an over 5% increase in the past week. Although prices are up, its trading volume has declined by 24%, while its market cap is up by 0.23%.

At the core, inefficiencies in the publishing process, high publication costs and discriminatory practices stand out as major hurdles. These issues create an environment where researchers from underprivileged backgrounds or less renowned institutions struggle to get their work published and recognized. In this context, the need for a meritocratic system that recognizes and rewards scientific work based on its quality rather than the financial or institutional power behind it becomes crucial. One of the most pressing issues is the high cost associated with publishing, known as article processing charges (APCs), which can amount to thousands of dollars for top-tier journals. At present, Nature Communications, known for its high impact and prestige, charges around $6,800 to cover publication costs for all accepted research articles. Furthermore, publishers like PLoS ONE and BioMed Central can charge between $1,500 and $6,000. This amount can pose a financial barrier, limiting access for researchers from less affluent institutions and countries to publish in prestigious journals and gain recognition for their scientific achievements. Submission process of a traditional journal with peer review. Source: Researcher Connect Moreover, the traditional peer review system, while foundational for maintaining the quality and integrity of published research, is often criticized for its lack of transparency and potential for bias. Issues such as delayed reviews and reviewers’ anonymity can sometimes contribute to unjust rejections or underestimate the significance of the research. Blockchain as a Solution for Academic Publishing Challenges Blockchain technology, best known for its role in cryptocurrency, offers a promising solution to several systemic issues plaguing the academic publishing industry. Its fundamental features —decentralization, transparency and security— align well with the need for more equitable and efficient publishing practices. Blockchain introduces a decentralized model where research can be published and accessed on a distributed ledger. This model reduces the influence of any single reviewer or editor, thereby diminishing potential biases in the selection and review processes. Also, the transparency inherent in blockchain technology can be leveraged to make the peer review process more open and fair. Every transaction on a blockchain is recorded on an immutable and time-stamped public ledger. Applying this to academic publishing means that submissions, decisions, and reviews can be traced and verified, which discourages misconduct and enhances trust in the published material. Another significant advantage of using blockchain is the security and permanence it offers. Once information is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, which ensures the permanent record of scientific discoveries. This feature is particularly crucial in a landscape where retractions and modifications of published research are concerns.

    "content": "Web3 and its underpinning transformative technology enable us to interact with digital assets in a way not previously thought possible. Despite being built upon principles such as decentralization, blockchain tech utilization, and user privacy, Web3 growth could quickly see stagnation without cross-chain composability. The capability for cross-chain composability ensures blockchain networks remain interoperable without sacrificing the efficiency to share information seamlessly. A lack of cross-chain composability risks rendering the adoption of Web3 inert without the ability to foster innovation and cooperative growth across individual blockchains. The Importance of Composability Cross-chain composability integration is fundamental to Web3 due to its ability to enable blockchains to integrate and interact with one another effortlessly. Crucial to the success of future Web3 adoption and the overcoming of technical hurdles, the importance of cross-chain composability cannot be overlooked. Composability on the scale of global blockchain interoperability enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and business models that can traverse multiple platforms seamlessly. Deriving growth from adaptability, Web3 and cross-chain composability go hand-in-hand by bridging and connecting disconnected blockchain networks. Going a step beyond dApps and Web3 growth, cross-chain compatibility impacts the financial implications of cross-chain interaction. By connecting different blockchains with cost-efficient bridges, composability effectively reduces transaction costs, grants increased user and developer flexibility and improves cross-chain transaction speeds. Challenges To Composability Efficient cross-chain composability — much like Web3 — faces a number of challenges before it can be truly achieved. Current solutions to composability only offer centralized bridges that cause division within the Web3 space. Such bridging solutions quickly result in the fragmentation of liquidity and incompatibility issues arising with wrapped asset movement across blockchains. Furthermore, these constricting bridging methods to composability pose only further complexity for users when it comes to the process. This directly impacts the user experience and mass adoption of decentralized technology in the future as non-technical users struggle to overcome steep learning curves. Some protocols have been diligently working to provide solutions to these challenges and bridge not just wrapped assets across blockchains but also the user experience. Sumer is one such protocol. By creating synthetic assets from established fiat and cryptocurrencies — like USD, ETH, and BTC — Sumer allows users to efficiently overcome composability hurdles through its omnichain technology. This makes the liquidity in the synthetic assets operable across all supported blockchains without sacrificing the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi). Focused on capital efficiency, Sumer utilizes a risk engine to correlate a user’s assets to liabilities — efficiently using capital while maximizing Debt-to-Asset (D/A) ratios. Moreover, Sumer furthers the concept of reStaking by making their liquidity more accessible across different blockchains through the protocol’s omnichain composability. Success Through Collaboration Web3 is built upon blockchain technology and like blockchain, connected structures function better through collaboration and cooperation as opposed to a disconnected system. This isn’t to say individual blockchains cannot be successful, but without bridges to connect them, the full potential of Web3 cannot be achieved. In scenarios where users are unable to leverage or transfer their assets smoothly from one blockchain to another, the user experience quickly deteriorates. The restriction of capital and bottlenecking of innovation can only hinder the mass adoption of Web3 technology and long-term success in the tech industry. A similar comparative example here would be in the 1950’s and 1960’s where computer networks were disconnected prior to the introduction of the internet. Once the internet was established, a then connected computer network enabled the effective sharing of data and informational access on a global scale. By utilizing cross-chain protocols like Sumer to facilitate asset transfer across different blockchains — through solutions like synthetic assets — the Web3 experience becomes far more collaborative. Moreover, by enabling cross-chain composability, overall market efficiency is also impacted positively. By improving accessibility to liquidity and smoother transactional processes, all forms of financial transaction stand to benefit. Composability: Overcoming Web3 Stagnation At a crossroads of adoption and stagnation, without effective cross-chain composability, Web3 risks becoming as siloed as the first computer networks of the 1950’s. Fragmentation of liquidity across blockchains — lacking the support of cross-chain composability — will only lead to the stunted growth of Web3 in the future as transaction volumes increase. Without the prioritization of cross-chain composability and the ability to deliver a fluid and interconnected blockchain solution, the Web3 user experience could ultimately suffer from long-term interoperability limitations. Instead, by incorporating omnichain bridging solutions to create a frictionless cross-chain process, protocols like Sumer help solidify the foundations of an interconnected Web3 future.\n",

Source: BitInfoCharts Bitcoin: Hashrate Hiccup Or Miner Exodus? Hashrate, a measure of the combined processing power dedicated to securing the Bitcoin network, typically climbs after a halving event as miners invest in more powerful rigs to compete for the reduced rewards. However, this time around, the trend defied expectations. Experts like Maartunn, a pseudonymous analyst at CryptoQuant, believe this signals a potential “miner capitulation.” Less efficient miners are now likely throwing in the towel. The halving, which cut block rewards in half, squeezed profit margins for miners using older equipment. As these miners shut down their operations, the hashrate dips.

This metric tracks the difference between short-term and long-term hashrate averages. When the gap widens, it suggests a decline in mining activity, potentially due to less efficient miners dropping off. The recent hashrate plunge has triggered a spike in Hash Ribbons, historically a sign of miner capitulation that has often coincided with price lows for Bitcoin. Source: CryptoQuant Bitcoin Miners Selling Off? Further fueling the capitulation theory is a decrease in Bitcoin’s Miner Reserve. This metric tracks the amount of Bitcoin held in wallets associated with miners. A decline in the reserve suggests miners might be offloading their mined coins, potentially to cover operational costs or to exit the market altogether. Undervaluation Signal Or Cyclical Dip? Maartunn interprets these signs as a bullish indicator. Hash Ribbons often point to opportune moments to buy, he argues.

Some argue that the hashrate decline could be temporary, perhaps due to factors like extreme weather events disrupting mining operations in certain regions. Additionally, the post-halving period is typically one of adjustment for miners, and a short-term hashrate fluctuation might not necessarily signal a mass exodus. The post-halving Bitcoin landscape is still unfolding. While the hashrate decline and other signs suggest a potential buying opportunity, particularly for long-term investors, the situation remains fluid.

    "content": "The crypto market is witnessing increased interest as several currencies demonstrate remarkable growth potential. Amid the anticipation of the impending bull run, many potential investors are trying to pinpoint the best possible tokens to add to their portfolio and maximize their investment. Among these, Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), and WienerAI ($WAI) stand out due to their solid foundations and promising prospects. These currencies have captured the attention of investors seeking promising meme coins that could deliver gains in the 100x range in the near future. Numerous experts and seasoned analysts are positive that Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), and WienerAI ($WAI) offer the greatest potential to skyrocket and bring exponential gains to early investors! Let’s go through all the essential details and see what these tokens have to offer! \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy the Best Meme Coin Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) is the Hottest Multi-Chain Presale Token Already Raising Over $15 Million Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain cryptocurrency, has made a notable entrance into the crypto market with a successful presale that has raised over $15 million. This impressive achievement highlights the significant investor interest and market potential of the project. At the core of Dogeverse is Cosmo, a versatile doge character designed to enhance accessibility and adaptability across multiple blockchains. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that operate on a single blockchain, Dogeverse seamlessly functions across six blockchains, including Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Base, Solana, and BNB Chain. This flexibility enables efficient transactions with reduced fees, making it an attractive option for users seeking cost-effective solutions. The project’s structure is robust, boasting a total supply of 200 billion tokens, with 30 billion tokens available during the ongoing presale period. Additionally, 25% of the token supply is allocated for marketing efforts, underscoring the project’s commitment to gaining widespread visibility and adoption. Dogeverse’s uniqueness lies in its approach, drawing inspiration from Dogecoin while introducing notable improvements to stand out in the crowded cryptocurrency space. Its adaptability across multiple ecosystems expands its potential user base and integration opportunities, further enhancing its utility. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Dogeverse Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sealana ($SEAL) is one of the Newest Additions to the Solana Network Drawing Inspiration from the Popular South Park Character Sealana ($SEAL) has emerged as a captivating meme coin sensation within the Solana ecosystem. Despite having no defined utility, its novel concept and community-driven approach have captured the imaginations of both low and high-risk investors. The project’s novelty revolves around a quirky seal character, a redneck American seal, who dives deep into the Solana sea in search of the next big crypto opportunity. This comedic premise, coupled with cultural references, elevates Sealana beyond a mere meme coin, positioning it as a cultural phenomenon. One of Sealana’s key attractions is its innovative airdrop model. Unlike traditional presales with predetermined price tiers, investors can send $SOL tokens to a designated wallet address and receive an airdrop of Sealana tokens directly after the presale concludes. For each $SOL deposited, the project airdrops 6,449 $SEAL tokens, a simplicity that has contributed to the project’s viral success. Sealana’s presale has already garnered significant traction, raising over $1.2 million within the first few weeks. This achievement has caught the attention of reputable crypto analysts, with some speculating that Sealana could replicate the success of other meme coin projects within the Solana ecosystem. While Sealana’s lack of defined utility relies primarily on speculative demand, the project’s offbeat concept and community enthusiasm have made it a notable contender in the meme coin space, particularly as anticipation builds for a potential Solana bull run. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sealana Now\u003c\u003c\u003c WienerAI ($WAI) is Introducing a Cutting Edge AI-Trading Bot WienerAI ($WAI) is a unique offering in the cryptocurrency space, combining the appeal of meme coins with the innovative potential of artificial intelligence. While drawing inspiration from popular dog-themed tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, WienerAI aims to present a more approachable and personable aspect of AI technology. One of the standout features of WienerAI is its exclusive presale, which offers deeply discounted $WAI tokens and daily staking rewards. The presale is structured in tiers, with token prices increasing as certain funding milestones are met, creating a sense of urgency for early investors. Currently, stakers can earn an annual percentage yield (APY) of around 577%, though this rate is designed to decrease as more investors join. WienerAI ($WAI) has already generated significant interest, raising over $350,000 on its first day of presale. The project has launched without a hard cap, and 30% of its 69 billion total token supply is dedicated to the presale. However, the project goes beyond mere novelty by incorporating an AI-powered trading bot that promises to elevate trading experiences. This innovative bot aims to streamline swapping processes, provide responsive query handling, and offer MEV protection, all without encountering additional fees for users. This structure, combined with the innovative blend of memetics and technology, positions WienerAI as a potential high-growth opportunity. Moreover, WienerAI is built on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token, boasting infinite upgradeability. This means that the project is not just a static meme coin but a constantly evolving AI initiative at the forefront of innovation, providing added value to investors beyond pure speculation. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy WienerAI Now\u003c\u003c\u003c The Final Words At the end of the day, the crypto world is a wild ride, and meme coins are often the thrill-seekers of this digital frontier. On top of that, amongst so many choices it can be hard to pinpoint the best option to add to your portfolios. That’s why through thorough research many experts and seasoned analysts are all pointing in the direction of these tokens Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), and WienerAI ($WAI) as they show great potential to skyrocket and bring gains up to 100x. Whether you’re a risk-taker or a cautious observer, it’s hard to ignore the buzz surrounding these tokens. Act now, before some of these tokens conclude their presale stage and the prices go up in the near future!\n",

    "content": "QCP Capital, a prominent institutional-focused firm, has recently projected that Bitcoin could revisit its peak price levels, potentially reaching up to $74,000 shortly. This prediction follows the latest United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which has significantly boosted risk assets. The firm noted that the positive surge in the market is partly due to the renewed buy-side demand, as evidenced by the buying patterns that resemble those of Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) market makers. Related Reading Most Important Bitcoin Indicator Nears Bullish Flip: $150,000 Soon? 3 days ago Institutional Inflows And Market Indicators Point To A Bitcoin Bullish Trend In a detailed analysis shared through their Telegram channel, QCP Broadcast, the firm stated: “We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of 74k.” Substantial institutional interest in Bitcoin supports this sentiment, as large asset managers like Millennium and Schonfeld have allocated about 3% and 2% of their Assets Under Management (AUM), respectively, to spot BTC ETFs. The optimism surrounding Bitcoin is not just theoretical but backed by significant market activity. For instance, inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US reached a two-week high of $303 million as of May 15th, signaling a robust renewal of institutional confidence. Fidelity’s FBTC fund led this influx with $131 million, followed by Bitwise’s BITB fund, which saw $86 million, marking its highest since early March. Grayscale’s GBTC, which had experienced outflows for four months, reversed this trend with a $27 million inflow. Yesterday, May 15, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETFs was $303 million. Grayscale ETF GBTC had a single-day net inflow of $27.0466 million, Fidelity ETF FBTC had an inflow of $131 million, and Bitwise ETF BITB had an inflow of $86.2578 million. https://t.co/npjWVH3bMi — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 16, 2024 Further underlining this bullish sentiment, Millennium Management holds a roughly $2 billion Bitcoin ETF portfolio, making it the largest holder of specific Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. Other hedge funds, including Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital and Apollo Management Holdings, have also disclosed significant holdings in Bitcoin ETFs, showcasing the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Market Performance And Future Outlook Bitcoin’s market performance has been quite notable. It has increased nearly 10% over the past week, including a 2.7% rise in the last 24 hours alone. BTC price is moving sideways on the 4-hour chart. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com QCP Capital attributes this trend to several factors, including significant “sovereign and institutional adoption, easing inflation concerns, and the upcoming US elections,” all of which contribute to a favorable market outlook. The positive sentiment is also partly due to the CPI data released on May 15th, which met expectations and eased concerns about inflation. This is crucial as lower inflation rates influence the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates, making riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking higher yields. James Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Realvision, also cited the Global Money Supply (M2) index as a critical indicator of Bitcoin’s price movements. According to Coutts, the M2 money aggregates, which include cash and checking deposits and are easily convertible near money, are central to understanding liquidity flows within the global financial system. He noted, “The money stock often moves in one direction, with significant drops like those seen in 2022 being rare and typically brief.” Related Reading Bitcoin Breaks Free: Emerging from Bearish Sentiment, Crypto Market Optimism Rises 4 days ago Coutts predicts that any significant break above Bitcoin’s all-time highs could pave the way for it to reach around $150,000 in this cycle. He remarked, “Watch the 101/102 level on DXY. If that breaks, then we should see ~$150k BTC this cycle,” emphasizing the interplay between liquidity and market cycles.

This project has set a new standard by integrating technologies like Wormhole and Portal Bridge. This allows users to seamlessly transfer DOGEVERSE tokens across multiple blockchains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana. This capability not only enhances the token’s utility but also widens its reach and boosts liquidity among different crypto communities. The project’s ICO has been very successful, raising $15 million and signaling strong investor interest. Currently, tokens are priced at $0.00031, but as the ICO draws to a close, this rate is expected to change once Dogeverse lists on decentralized exchanges (DEX). To support these listings, 20 million tokens, or 10% of the total supply, have been allocated to ensure adequate liquidity. Dogeverse also offers a staking platform where token holders can earn an estimated annual yield of 62%. The excitement around Dogeverse is further amplified by endorsements from influential YouTubers and significant coverage in crypto publications, enhancing its visibility and appeal in the meme coin sector. These are just some of the reasons why many traders are calling Dogeverse the next big thing in meme coins. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Dogeverse Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Wiener AI ($WAI) – Meme Coin with High Staking Rewards The next best crypto to hold in May is also a meme coin – Wiener AI. Wiener AI has quickly established itself in the cryptocurrency market with a unique blend of meme coin allure and advanced AI technology. On its first day, the project launched its presale and raised over $350K. Wiener AI appeals to both speculative traders and those seeking long-term value by combining humor with technological innovation, offering a unique investment opportunity. To attract a wide investor base, Wiener AI offers daily staking rewards, which have generated significant interest. Currently, stakers can receive an annual percentage yield (APY) of about 577%, designed to decrease as more investors join, creating a sense of urgency for early entry. Wiener AI has launched with no hard cap yet announced and 30% of its 69 billion total token supply is dedicated to the presale. During the presale, the project’s tiered pricing system ensures that early buyers receive more value for their money, with token prices set to increase as certain funding milestones are met. This structure, coupled with the innovative combination of technology and memetics, positions Wiener AI as a possible 100X coin. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Wiener AI Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sealana ($SEAL) – American-Redneck Seal Resonates with Investors Who Poured Over $500,000 in the Presale Sealana, the newest meme coin to hit the Solana blockchain, has already raised over half a million dollars in its ongoing presale. This quirky seal, depicted as engrossed in trading from his PC, symbolizes a light-hearted take on the often-serious world of crypto. Crypto enthusiasts are drawn to Sealana not just for its playful imagery but for the potential it shows in the booming meme coin market. Popular crypto YouTuber, Crypto Gains, who has over 130,000 subscribers, recently highlighted that SEAL could bring gains in the 100X range. He described it as a promising investment for those looking to get in on the ground floor but also cautioned it as a high-risk asset, advising only to invest what one can afford to lose. Sealana’s appeal extends beyond its meme; it’s about creating a community for traders who see themselves in the laid-back, snack-munching seal. With its presale offering 6,900 SEAL tokens for every SOL coin deposited, Sealana promises to keep the spirit of fun alive in the crypto world, reminding investors to balance their health with their financial pursuits. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sealana Now\u003c\u003c\u003c 99 Bitcoins ($99BTC) – Learn About Crypto \u0026 Receive Big Reward for Doing It 99Bitcoins, a well-established name in the crypto media space since 2013, is expanding its offerings with an innovative Learn-to-Earn platform. This new feature builds on the successful models of Play-to-Earn and Move-to-Earn, providing users with a gamified and interactive environment to learn about crypto. As participants progress through various educational modules and quizzes, they earn rewards, making the learning process both engaging and profitable. The launch of the 99Bitcoins token, currently available at presale, has already raised over $1.2 million. This token not only facilitates access to the Learn-to-Earn platform but also offers additional benefits including crypto trading signals, a VIP community group, and substantial staking rewards. Initially, stakers can receive an annual percentage yield (APY) of about 1,400%, although this rate will decrease as more participants join the pool. Analysts are optimistic about the token’s future, with some predicting as much as 10X gains following its upcoming exchange launch. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy 99 Bitcoins Now\u003c\u003c\u003c 5th Scape ($5SCAPE) – VR Crypto Project Reaches the $5.5 Million Milestone 5th Scape is a new VR gaming platform on the Ethereum blockchain, offering an immersive metaverse experience.

The 5SCAPE token is essential for transactions within the ecosystem—whether for buying games, accessing content, or purchasing hardware. It also incentivizes developers by offering them a significant share of subscription revenues for their VR experiences, promoting continual innovation. Currently, in the midst of a multi-stage ICO, 5th Scape has already raised over $5.8 million. This ICO provides a strategic entry point for investors looking to tap into the burgeoning VR market, with token prices expected to rise as the presale progresses. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy 5th Scape Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sponge V2 ($SPONGEV2) – Next Version of Last Year’s $100M MCAP Runner SpongeV2 is the latest iteration of the $SPONGE meme token, which initially saw a meteoric rise, skyrocketing its market cap to over $100 million in 2023. Building on this momentum, the V2 version aims to captivate the crypto community by increasing the total supply to 150 billion tokens and introducing a new play-to-earn racing game where players can earn $SPONGE tokens. The development team behind $SPONGE is setting ambitious goals, including potential listings on major exchanges like Binance and OKX. Such listings could significantly enhance the token’s visibility and value, similar to other meme coins that have experienced price surges post-listing. Currently, acquiring $SPONGE V2 requires investors to stake and permanently lock their V1 tokens. This process not only secures rewards for four years but also offers a purchase bonus, doubling the initial number of tokens bought during this period. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sponge V2 Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Chainlink ($LINK) – New Highs Expected in 2024 As Ethereum’s ecosystem expands and decentralized finance (DeFi) gains traction, Chainlink’s oracle network becomes increasingly important. Thousands of decentralized applications (dApps) rely on Chainlink’s services to access real-world data, enabling functionalities like DeFi, sports betting, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. With Ethereum’s growth and the surging interest in DeFi, Chainlink benefits immensely. The rising utilization of Chainlink’s data feeds by more dApps translates to higher network fees and an appreciation of the $LINK token’s value. After doubling in value over the past year, Chainlink transferred that momentum into 2024. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet the Best Presale Token Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Conclusion After a bearish post-halving period, the market is finally showing signs of recovering. This goes in line with previous halving, which all created a month-long bear sentiment, and then started massive bull runs right after. That’s when most coins explode 2-3X. However, for those 10X or bigger gems, you have to dig a bit deeper. And that’s what we did with our team of crypto experts. All projects that we covered today could easily ten-fold in value by the end of May. All that you have to do is to pick one, or a few that seem like a good fit for your portfolio. Happy investing!\n",

    "content": "In a remarkable turn of events, Bitcoin (BTC) has broken out of its recent trading range, recording a 7% surge in the past 24 hours alone. The cryptocurrency tests the $66,000 resistance level, setting the stage for a potential move toward higher targets. The latest momentum shift in Bitcoin’s price action has caught the attention of industry experts, particularly the co-founders of on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. According to their analysis, the trigger for a larger market structure release has been in the works since the March highs. Bitcoin Breaks Out The co-founders of Glassnode believe this breakout has been coming for a long time. They state that they have been waiting for the trigger to unleash a major bullish structure since the March highs when Bitcoin reached its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,700, and it looks like the market has finally done so. Related Reading Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu to Soar 50% Amidst Meme Coin Market Rise 4 days ago They believe the trigger was the recent lower-than-expected US inflation figures and weaker retail sales data, which could prompt a more “dovish stance” from the Federal Reserve. According to the Glassnode co-founders, this opens the door to a more dovish stance from the Fed. They explain that Bitcoin and the market liked this, and now they expect the price to reach $66,000 before $69,000 and then up towards $84,000. They also believe the altcoins will follow this move strongly. However, not all analysts are as bullish in the immediate term. Crypto trader and analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin needs to hold the $65,000 level as new support, cautioning that the $68,000 and $73,000 price levels could act as resistance and liquidity pockets. He warns that if Bitcoin loses the $65,000 support, it’s back to the “chopfest” – further consolidation and volatility. Andrew Tate Considers Dumping Fiat For BTC In a surprising move, popular internet personality and self-proclaimed “Top G” Andrew Tate has announced his intention to abandon fiat currency and invest over $100 million into Bitcoin. In a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Tate declared, “I’m about to leave fiat completely and ape over 100M into BTC.” Tate, who has faced numerous legal issues and has been banned from several social media platforms, cited his frustrations with the traditional banking system and fiat currency as the driving force behind this potential decision. “I’m done with the banks. I’m done with their money. Done with the scams,” he wrote in the post. Related Reading Ethereum Bull Flag Breakout: ATH On The Horizon As Major Metrics Turn Bullish 4 days ago In a follow-up post, Tate acknowledged that he has not finalized this decision, as he currently holds more cryptocurrency than fiat currency in his portfolio. However, he hinted that he might “leave fiat completely,” suggesting that his preference for Bitcoin and other digital assets is growing. The 1-D chart shows BTC’s trending upwards. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com As of press time, Bitcoin is testing the $65,900 mark, having regained its bullish momentum. It remains to be seen how far the current rally can extend and whether the bullish momentum can survive potential selling pressure at higher price levels.

    "summary": "Novogratz predicts that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely remain within a relatively narrow trading range for the current quarter.\n",
    "content": "Mike Novogratz, the CEO and founder of Galaxy Digital, shared his insights on the current state of the cryptocurrency market. According to Bloomberg, Novogratz predicts that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely remain within a relatively narrow trading range for the current quarter as the adoption of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance continues to evolve. Stagnant Crypto Market Per the report, Novogratz described the current phase in the crypto market as a consolidation period. He emphasized that Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), are expected to consolidate. This consolidation phase suggests that the Bitcoin price will likely trade within a range of approximately $55,000 to $75,000 until significant market events drive prices higher. Related Reading On A Tear: Toncoin Outshines Bitcoin With Price Surge And Social Buzz 5 days ago The crypto market has experienced a period of stagnation following the historic bull run witnessed in the past two quarters. This surge was fueled by the launch of spot US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the Bitcoin Halving, which reduced the supply of new BTC. However, Bitcoin’s price trend reversed due to diminishing optimism surrounding interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), amid consistently strong economic indicators. According to Novogratz’s analysis, if his predictions hold, Solana could continue to consolidate within its current trading range of $120 to $150. This consolidation has been observed over the past month, indicating a period of stability for the cryptocurrency. Similarly, Ethereum’s price has closely mirrored Bitcoin’s movements and has traded between the $2,870 and $3,200 levels. Ethereum recently failed to consolidate above the significant $4,000 mark reached in mid-March. As a result, Ethereum has experienced a period of price consolidation within the range above. Bitcoin Volatility Persists Novogratz acknowledged the tailwinds that propelled the market during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Galaxy’s CEO believes that these tailwinds will likely persist throughout the current quarter and possibly the next unless there are significant developments, such as the Fed initiating rate cuts due to an economic slowdown or until the regulatory landscape becomes clearer after the upcoming election. Moreover, Novogratz noted a significant shift in counterparties’ willingness to lend crypto for extended periods without collateral, a trend that was not prevalent just six months ago. He emphasized that engagement in the crypto space has reached a new level, with growing interest from individuals and institutions alike.

Since achieving a record high of $73,700 on March 14, the largest cryptocurrency in the market has undergone a 16% decline. Despite this, Galaxy Digital reported notable first-quarter results, with net income more than tripling to $421.7 million. The daily chart shows that BTC’s price is trending downward.

    "content": "There are important developments around Render (RNDR), Ethereum (ETH), and Raboo (RABT). Render has achieved exceptional milestones, highlighting the increasing relevance of AI cryptos. Ethereum has managed to hold above the crucial $3k support level while Raboo’s presale continues to grow. These developments highlight the growing interest in AI cryptos and influence the ETH price, while Raboo stands out as a promising investment option. Render (RNDR) Reaches Exceptional Milestones Render (RNDR) has recently achieved exceptional milestones. This highlights the growing relevance of AI cryptos in the market. The Render Network offers a decentralized solution for rendering graphics. This is making it particularly attractive to artists and developers. Render’s recent successes reinforce confidence in AI cryptos’ ability to transform the industry. These advancements have led to an increase in the value and popularity of RNDR. There are also disadvantages to the Render project. The network faces significant technical challenges, such as the complexity of decentralized rendering and the need for high computing power. Furthermore, the dependence on adoption by artists and developers can be a barrier, especially if competitors enter the market with more advanced technologies. These factors can impact Render’s long-term growth and sustainability. Ethereum (ETH) Remains Above the $3K Ethereum (ETH) has managed to hold above the critical $3k support level. This is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and momentum in the market. This development comes amid the wider adoption of AI cryptos. It strengthens the position of Ethereum as a leading platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. The current ETH price remains a major concern for anyone who relies on the stability and functionality of the Ethereum network. There are some disadvantages associated with the Ethereum project. The scalability issues and high transaction fees remain a challenge, especially compared to newer blockchains that offer better solutions. Also, the transition to Ethereum 2.0 is a long and complex process. This entails uncertainty about the future performance and stability of the network. These factors could deter investors and hinder long-term adoption of Ethereum. Raboo (RABT) Has Over $1.3m Raised Raboo (RABT) is currently in the third phase of its presale. Tokens are available for $0.0042 each. The presale has already raised more than $1.3 million. This underscores the strong investor interest in this promising project. Raboo combines the power of AI and SocialFi. It also places a strong emphasis on community engagement with its unique Post-to-Earn feature. This innovative approach offers investors a unique opportunity to be part of a growing ecosystem. Raboo has the potential to significantly change the market. By getting in now, investors can take advantage of the early access and associated benefits. Raboo will continue to grow and reach its full potential. Conclusion Despite Render’s promising milestones and stable ETH price, Raboo emerges as the most promising investment option. With its innovative combination of AI and SocialFi technologies and a strong focus on community engagement, Raboo offers a solid and future-oriented investment. The presale has already raised more than $1.3 million, highlighting the growing interest and potential of this project.

    "content": "Despite a recent surge in activity from large investors, often referred to as “whales,” the price of Toncoin (TON) appears headed for choppier waters. This comes as analysts raise concerns about the cryptocurrency’s weakening technical indicators and its potential breach of a key support level. Related Reading Crypto Alert: VeChain Bull Run Imminent, Expert Predicts 500% Rally 2 days ago Whales Make A Splash, But Can They Save The Day? In a recent report, Joao Wedson, a crypto analyst at CryptoQuant, observed a significant spike in whale activity on the Toncoin network. Transactions exceeding 100,000 TON (roughly equivalent to $645,000 at current prices) surpassed a staggering $1 billion in the past few weeks. This indicates that major holders have been actively moving large amounts of TON, but the purpose behind these movements remains unclear. While the whales are certainly making a splash, Wedson said it’s not necessarily translating to smooth sailing for TON’s price. He pointed out that while large transactions dominate the network’s volume (over 50%), their impact on the price seems negligible. Conversely, smaller transactions, although constituting the majority of overall activity, contribute a much smaller share of the total volume. Technical Indicators Flash Red Toncoin’s price has been exhibiting signs of weakness despite the influx of whale activity. Notably, TON recently dipped below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a technical indicator used to gauge short-term trends. This suggests that the average price of TON over the past 20 days has been on a downward slope, signifying a shift towards selling pressure. Toncoin is currently trading at $6.52. Chart; TradingView Adding to the bearish sentiment is the imminent crossover of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. The MACD line appears poised to fall below its signal line, which traditionally indicates a loss of upward momentum and a potential price decline. These technical indicators are flashing red flags for TON. If the price breaches the lower line of its ascending channel, which has been acting as a support level, a drop to $5.70 is a distinct possibility.

The current situation surrounding Toncoin presents a conundrum for investors. The substantial whale activity hints at potential bullish interest, but the technical indicators paint a bleak picture. The key question remains: are the whales accumulating or distributing? If they’re accumulating, this could be a buying opportunity before the price rebounds. However, if they’re selling off their holdings, it could be a sign of a distressed ship. Featured image from Vikks/Shutterstock, chart from TradingView\n",

    "content": "It’s been nearly a month since the Bitcoin halving – and we haven’t seen the bull runs that we expected yet. On the contrary, the market went down since then, causing a panic sell-off among traders. However, experts assure us that this downturn is typical and that the bull run usually begins the month after Bitcoin rewards are halved. Experts also emphasize that the best way to profit from the upcoming bull market is by investing in low market cap presale projects. This makes sense, given that presales often provide a cheap entry point for investors. The real challenge, however, is identifying which presales are worth your time and investment. Luckily for you, our team of veteran market analysts pinpointed a few presale projects that are showing massive growth potential. Let’s check them out. \u003e\u003e\u003eGet the Best Presale Project Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Best Crypto Presales to Buy Before the Halving Bull Run – Quick Overview Before we move on to the detailed analysis, let’s take a look at the essentials of these promising presales.

This Doge-inspired token recently received an endorsement from the popular 99Bitcoins YouTube channel, which suggested it could be the next 100x crypto. One reason for the excitement is a substantial investment of $183,000 by a prominent crypto whale into the Dogeverse presale, highlighting strong confidence in the project’s potential. The key feature of Dogeverse is its vision to unite meme coin communities across different blockchains. Utilizing cross-chain bridging technology, Dogeverse will be accessible on six blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Base. This multi-chain functionality allows DOGEVERSE holders to interact with various networks seamlessly, offering them diverse opportunities. Additionally, Dogeverse provides staking rewards for token holders who choose to lock up their DOGEVERSE. This incentivizes long-term holding and contributes to the project’s stability. If it can harness the current viral momentum in the meme coin market, Dogeverse may even rival niche leaders like DOGE or SHIB. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Dogeverse Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Wiener AI ($WAI) – Earn Up to 577% APY Through Staking Platform Wiener AI is a unique project that combines the fun-nature of the meme coins with robust AI functionalities Launched recently, Wiener AI’s presale garnered over $350,000 on its first day, reflecting strong investor interest. To attract a diverse investor base, Wiener AI offers daily staking rewards. Currently, stakers can enjoy an annual percentage yield (APY) of around 577%, although this rate is designed to decrease as more investors join, creating a sense of urgency for early participants. This high yield is particularly attractive for those looking to maximize their returns in the early stages of the project. Wiener AI has allocated 30% of its 69 billion total token supply to the presale, with no hard cap yet announced. This tiered pricing system ensures that early buyers receive more value for their investment, as token prices are set to increase once certain funding milestones are achieved. This structure, combined with the innovative blend of AI technology and meme coin appeal, positions Wiener AI as a promising investment opportunity. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Wiener AI Now\u003c\u003c\u003c Sealana ($SEAL) – New SOL-Based Meme Coin Raises Over $800,000 In Presale Funding Sealana ($SEAL) is quickly becoming a hot new meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Just a few weeks into its presale, it has already raised over $950,000, showing that it’s catching the attention of the crypto crowd. The coin’s mascot is a lazy, obese seal, inspired by the World of Warcraft Guy from South Park, who decides to trade cryptocurrencies to move out of his mom’s basement. This fun backstory adds a playful twist to the project. To join the Sealana presale, investors can transfer SOL tokens to the wallet address DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c, and they’ll get $SEAL tokens in return. You can also buy $SEAL directly through the Sealana presale website. Right now, 1 SOL gets you 6,900 $SEAL tokens, making it a pretty sweet deal for early birds. Sealana’s presale success mirrors the buzz around other SOL-based meme coins like Popcat and Solama, which have delivered impressive returns. As a new player in this space, Sealana has the potential to make a big splash in the crypto market in 2024. Thanks to the speedy and scalable Solana blockchain, Sealana aims to offer a smooth trading experience. Its quirky storyline and clever use of pop culture give it an edge in the meme coin world. \u003e\u003e\u003eBuy Sealana Now\u003c\u003c\u003c 99 Bitcoins ($99BTC) – Crypto Media Outlet Releases Learn-to-Earn Platform 99Bitcoins, a well-established crypto learning platform with over 2 million users, is taking a significant step forward by introducing a learn-to-earn model.

    "content": "Cardano (ADA) whales are back in the picture, with recent data suggesting their confidence in the crypto token may have been revived. If so, this will be massive for ADA, which could experience significant price surges soon enough based on this development. Related Reading Solana On The Brink? Price Stalemate At Crucial $140 Support 3 days ago Cardano Whales Add To Their Holdings The market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock recently revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Cardano whales (who hold between 100 million and 1 billion ADA) have now added 11% to their balances over the past 30 days. These investors now hold 6.71% of Cardano’s total supply. This represents a bullish development for Cardano since whale accumulation usually suggests that these investors are positioning for a potential price surge. These whales also contribute to the price surge since buys of such magnitude could trigger a rally in the price of any crypto token. Besides the whales, retail investors are also heavily invested in Cardano. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that the bid-ask volume imbalance is bullish for ADA. Furthermore, the ‘In The Money’ metric has also turned bullish for Cardano, meaning that most of these investors are currently in profit. Generally, the confidence in the Cardano ecosystem is growing once again. Data from DeFiLlama shows that the Total Value Locked (TVL) on the network has increased by over 5% in the last seven days. Lately, there has also been a significant increase in Cardano’s trading volume, meaning users are actively trading on the network. Cardano is currently trading at $0.482. Chart: TradingView Cardano’s Rally Is Imminent Crypto analyst World of Charts suggested that Cardano might soon experience a significant rally, noting that the crypto token’s breakout was already confirmed and moving toward the projected price targets. The analyst had previously predicted that a successful breakout would take Cardano’s price to $1 in the coming weeks. Crypto analyst Trend Rider also confirmed that Cardano is already witnessing a bullish reversal, highlighting the bounce the crypto token made after flashing a bullish signal on the daily chart. In the short term, the analyst expects ADA to climb back above $0.5 and added that Cardano will need to hold above $0.51 on the weekly to end the price correction and confirm a bullish continuation. Related Reading Whale Watch: Ethereum Fresh Buy Signal Sparks Speculation 3 days ago Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, also provided insights into Cardano’s future trajectory. He noted that Cardano is currently breaking its 20-day moving average (MA), which the analyst claimed is a very “nice sign” for ADA. Gambardello pointed out on Cardano’s daily chart that the 50-day MA has crossed the 200-day MA, which likely means that the bottom is already in, and this is the lowest Cardano will go. This occurrence is referred to as a golden cross and is a bullish signal, indicating the beginning of an upward trend. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView\n",

    "content": "According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin rose by 2.9% on Friday to trade above $67,000 for the first time since April 24. This positive price performance by the maiden cryptocurrency has been attributed to the low inflation levels reported in the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. However, Bitcoin is an asset subject to the influence of several forces. According to a report by blockchain analysis platform LookonChain, BTC may soon experience another price rally following an increase in the supply of a specific stablecoin. Related Reading: Unstoppable Bitcoin? CryptoQuant’s CEO Foresees Bull Run Extending To 2025 Can USDT Replicate Surging Effect On Bitcoin? In an X post on Friday, LookonChain reported that the Tether Treasury has minted an additional 1 billion USDT indicating a consistent rising demand for the stablecoin. USDT which ranks as the third largest cryptocurrency doubles as the most dominant stablecoin in the crypto space with a market cap value of $111.25 billion. The USDT token has famously recorded much growth in the last year with over 31 billion new tokens minted on the Tron and Ethereum network. Interestingly, LookonChain reveals that this rise in USDT market share contributed significantly to Bitcoin’s ascent from $27,000 to $73,000 in the past fifteen months. The theory behind this relationship stems from an increase in traders’ liquidity provided by investments in USDT. This increased market liquidity can alter the status of Bitcoin’s supply and demand and oftentimes lead to a rise in BTC’s price. Following the most recent 1 billion USDT minted by the Tether Treasury, most investors and spectators could be expecting a similar boosting effect on Bitcoin’s price, especially with the crypto bull season in play. However, Bitcoin’s price in the coming months is still likely to be influenced by other factors such as the BTC spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. According to data from SoSoValue, net inflows on Friday reached $177.01 million bringing the total value of the Bitcoin spot ETF market to $12.58 billion. As more major traditional finance players gain a piece of this novel market, Bitcoin is expected to experience monumental levels of demand which will translate into weighty price gains.

    "content": "The expanded partnership will bring a host of novel features to the Club’s official website, extend Fan Token utilities beyond the Socios.com app, and unlock more rewards and benefits for token holders. La Liga footballing giant Atlético de Madrid and Chiliz, the SportFi infrastructure provider and Socios.com app creator, announced plans to expand their current partnership to offer more benefits and utilities to Fan Token holders.

    "content": "Real World Assets (RWAs), such as real estate, have long been important, yet they have major limitations when accessible via global markets. These constraints are sometimes caused by the need to depend on transnational financial institutions to broker transactions. Regulatory inconsistencies and concerns over asset validity and ownership compound this, creating significant impediments to overseas investment. However, Web3 and blockchain technologies promise to revolutionize our ability to cope with these limits. These technologies may circumvent conventional financial intermediaries by allowing trustless transactions and delivering immutable evidence of ownership and asset authenticity. This results in a more efficient, secure, and accessible platform for global investment possibilities. This new environment facilitates international transactions and attracts more investors. The Importance of Web3 and Blockchain Tech in Real Estate Web3 is a term for independent technologies like blockchain and smart contracts that aim to automate and spread out different types of assets, such as real estate. Blockchain is a decentralized ledger that tracks events openly and transparently so anyone can check it. Next is where smart contracts come in; they automate transactions, automatically executing once pre-set conditions have been met. The technologies above change real estate transactions by eliminating traditional intermediaries, including banks and attorneys. These mediators typically ensure that all parties adhere to the provisions outlined in the agreement. Smart contracts and blockchain technology automatically and transparently execute these agreements for all parties, verifying the legitimacy of assets and ownership assertions. Consequently, expenses and the time needed to finalize real estate transactions are diminished. Eliminating reliance on these intermediaries is also strategically and practically advantageous. By diminishing the influence of traditional intermediaries, Web3 expands access to real estate investment opportunities for a wider demographic. This includes individuals lacking substantial financial resources or the expertise to navigate intricate international property regulations. Due to this transparency, the real estate market is more adaptable and diverse. MultiBank’s Role in Web3 Real Estate Tokenisation MultiBank Group, a globally regulated financial platform, has been pivotal in integrating Web3 technology into the real estate industry through its subsidiary, MultiBank.io. While MultiBank Group focuses on traditional finance, MultiBank.io leverages blockchain technology to enhance security and transparency in real estate investments and in the crypto sphere. By adhering to global financial regulations and utilizing a secure, immutable system, MultiBank.io ensures that all transactions are recorded accurately. This provides investors with a clear and lasting record of ownership. Moreover, MultiBank.io has developed technologies to simplify cross-border transactions, which are crucial for real estate deals involving global regulations and substantial sums of money. Their use of blockchain technology addresses common issues in international bank transfers, such as the need for intermediaries, high fees, and slow processing times. This improvement in transaction speed helps investors enter foreign markets more easily while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. How Blocksquare Works With Tokenization Blocksquare is a blockchain tool that uses software-as-a-service (SaaS) to turn real estate assets into tokens. This method ensures that operations are legal and can be expanded as needed. It also makes property investment management scalable and flexible. Because they created an economic system that makes their tokens more valuable, tokenomics makes sense. Important relationships in Web3 technology have also made the site more useful and open to more businesses. Blocksquare has a $94.8 million tokenized asset holding with 107 buildings in 21 countries. Blocksquare also plans to enter the neo-brokerage market, which aligns with its aim to drive innovation and growth in the RWA market. This is part of a bigger plan to build community networks around its projects and improve communication with local markets. Blocksquare actively participates in 11 markets and promotes real estate investment while building a feeling of community among owners and users. Blocksquare runs its business using blockchain systems like Ethereum, The Graph, 0x, Maker, Flux, Near, Uniswap, and DAI. Thanks to its strong and diverse technology base, Blocksquare will stay at the top of the constantly growing digital real estate market. It makes deals quick and safe and reaffirms the company’s dedication to honesty and dependable service. This is important for maintaining investors’ trust and happiness in the constantly changing real estate investment market. Looking forward Web3 and tokenization could change the world’s real estate markets by making investments easier to obtain and eliminating the need for agents to build trust. By turning real estate into digital tokens that can be transferred, this technology makes it much easier for people who are worried about money, government rules, or logistics to invest in homes abroad. This opens up opportunities for many buyers, even those who couldn’t before. A keystone of Web3 and tokenization, blockchain technology provides increased security and openness. Because blockchain transactions are permanent and open to public inspection, traditional middlemen like banks and lawyers are no longer needed. This may discourage dishonesty and corruption and simultaneously speed up and lower the investment process’s expenses. Historically, the real estate industry has had less liquidity and greater difficulty joining. Conversely, when token-based ownership transfers replace conventional property transactions, the real estate market gains more flexibility and life. Improving liquidity benefits investors looking to quickly modify their portfolios and helps maintain market stability by enabling the free flow of money in reaction to economic changes. Adopting Web3 and tokenization in real estate is not a small enhancement but a significant shift that makes the market more accessible, secure, and responsive. It reshapes the real estate investment environment by allowing a worldwide audience to participate while safeguarding these assets’ integrity via technology. This shift not only empowers individual investors but also has the potential to influence wider economic patterns, promoting development and stability in novel ways.\n",

    "summary": "Discover the top altcoins that crypto experts are eyeing for 2024, including Rollblock, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Arbitrum and Kaspa.\n",
    "content": "In the cryptocurrency market, traders continuously seek altcoins that can grow significantly. There are numerous options to choose from, but five altcoins could stand out as possible top performers of 2024: Rollblock (RBLK), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Arbitrum (ARB), and Kaspa (KAS). One may even soar by 100x soon – let’s see which one. 1. Rollblock (RBLK) First on our top altcoin list is Rollblock (RBLK) – a shining presale star. This presale has already obtained over $125K and is on pace to reach $1M before May 2024 ends. Not only that, over 12M RBLK tokens have been sold so far in under a week. This shows the level of interest in this innovative altcoin. Rollblock is a community-driven GambleFi protocol that disrupts the online gambling sector. Unlike Fairspin or Roobet, Rollblock is an online crypto casino that utilizes blockchain technology to its full potential. Thus, it does not require any sign-up KYC checks while drastically reducing unfairness since all transactions are recorded on the blockchain. The casino is fully licensed and operational with hundreds of players already enjoying the wide range of casino classics to choose from. Often with casinos you are betting against the house but by holding the RBLK token, you effectively become part of the house. This revolutionary dynamic sets Rollblock apart from the competition and the revenue-sharing model makes Rollblock stand out among other altcoins. By holding RBLK, you receive up to 30% of Rollblock’s weekly earnings. How this works is Rollblock will use the revenue to buy back RBLK tokens from the open market. Half of these tokens will be burned from the supply forever and the other half will be used to provide some of the best staking rewards in the crypto space. Some analysts believe this could amount to Rollblock buying back millions of dollars worth of RBLK each and every week, making this one of the stand out stars of 2024. Currently, the RBLK utility token is in Stage 1 of its presale and costs only $0.01. But, as the presale advances, this price will surge up to 1200%. Experts predict another 100x surge once this altcoin hits Tier-1 exchanges in Q3 of 2024. This price prediction looks pretty plausible, given that the online gambling sector is valued at $450B and expected to reach $744B by 2028. 2. Litecoin (LTC) Next, we have to talk about Litecoin (LTC), one of the altcoins to watch. According to Litecoin, it is now the #1 crypto for payments on BitPay. Over 41% of users have chosen this altcoin as a payment option. This Litecoin news shows the level of interest that traders still have in it. In terms of the Litecoin crypto value, it has jumped 3% in the past 12 months. From a technical analysis standpoint, this upswing may continue. Litecoin trades above its 50-day EMA, while six technical indicators are green. Therefore, experts forecast a potential price jump to $100 for Litecoin within Q2 of 2024. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE) According to experts, Dogecoin (DOGE) is another one of the best altcoins to buy in 2024. Recently, it saw major developments as Tesla formally embraced it as a payment option. All users need to do is have a Dogecoin wallet and they can buy many goods from the Tesla online store. This bullish Dogecoin news could trigger a bull run for this crypto. Speaking of which, this altcoin’s price has jumped over 100% in the past 12 months. The Dogecoin crypto trades above its 100 and 200-day EMAs while boasting 13 green technical indicators. Because of this, market analysts predict Dogecoin will trade at $0.14 before Q2 of 2024 ends. 4. Arbitrum (ARB) The second-to-last place on our top altcoin list is Arbitrum (ARB). Crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicts a major surge for this altcoin soon. In a new X post, he states that the TD Sequential for Arbitrum shows a buy signal on the 7-day chart. Martinez anticipates a one to four-candlestick rebound for this altcoin. CoinMarketCap data shows that the Arbitrum price movement fell 7% over the past year. However, the technical analysis for this crypto paints a different picture. For example, the Arbitrum crypto trades above its 50-day EMA while three technical indicators are flashing green. Experts foresee a surge to $1.24 within Q2 of 2024 in their Arbitrum price predictions. 5. Kaspa (KAS) Last, experts chose Kaspa (KAS) as one of the best altcoins in 2024. Over the past year alone, CoinMarketCap data shows that the Kaspa price surged nearly 450%. At one point in February, it hit a new all-time high of $0.18. Also, its market cap soared from $417M to $2.90B in the past 12 months. From a technical analysis standpoint, this bullish trend for the Kaspa coin may continue. There are now 23 technical indicators in the green while it trades above its 50 and 100-day EMAs. Because of this, analysts have made a bullish Kaspa price prediction. They predict Kaspa trading at $0.17 before Q2 of 2024. Final Thoughts of the Best Altcoins To Buy in 2024 While Rollblock, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Arbitrum and Kaspa are altcoins to watch, one stands out. Notably, Rollblock, which has a low market cap of just $10M, which means much higher growth potential as it needs less new funds for its price to skyrocket. If you are interested in one of the best altcoins at the moment, sign up for its presale now. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Currently in presale, Raboo has already amassed over $1.3 million with more than 5,000 registered members and 1,800 token holders. Priced at just $0.0042, the RABT token is tipped to surge 100x in 2024. Analysts also expect a 233% growth during the presale period. Could Raboo be the next AI crypto king? NEAR Protocol soars: Get in before the moonshot NEAR Protocol is making waves and rapidly climbing the market cap rankings. Its innovative features and cutting-edge technology are drawing in traders and crypto enthusiasts daily. On the development side, NEAR’s co-founder is looking way ahead, predicting that artificial intelligence will be a game-changer for DAOs. In the past month, NEAR has surged nearly 50%, gaining strong upward momentum. Over the past year, the NEAR token has skyrocketed by over 335%, reflecting growing adoption and boosting the network’s overall growth. Despite the recent bear market, NEAR’s price has shown resilience. Analysts predict a strong comeback, expecting NEAR to replicate its past successes and continue its upward trajectory., especially as the recent successful transmission of the first encrypted message on its X Page demonstrates the protocol’s potential for broader application. ETH falls: What’s next for Ethereum? Ethereum’s been in the news lately, and it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Ethereum’s price has been dipping down around $3,000, which might be because investors who bought in early are cashing out their profits. On the bright side, developers are working on improving the Ethereum wallets. Of course, regulatory turmoil regarding crypto also remains a point of focus, which can also make the market jittery. In line with losses from last month, Ethereum sellers remain dominant. The price consolidation is clear, with Ethereum moving sideways and down 6% over the past week. The trading volume is also below Ethereum’s average, sitting at just $11 billion. This inactivity suggests the market is waiting for a breakout. Whether Ethereum moves above or drops will indicate if this sideways movement is a period of distribution or accumulation. Raboo turns heads in the meme market Raboo is integrating SocialFi and artificial intelligence, by offering a fun and rewarding way for token holders to generate and share memes. Social-fi combines social media and finance, creating platforms where users earn by engaging. It’s innovative because it rewards creativity and interaction, making social activities financially beneficial. Raboo’s ecosystem features NFTs, merchandise, and AI-generated memes. This creates a dynamic playground where users can express themselves and engage with others. It’s a community-driven environment that celebrates digital creativity. Raboo’s token, RABT, is designed to drive the $62 billion meme market. A future crypto burn event will reduce token supply, potentially increasing value. The smart contract has been audited by SOLIDProof, ensuring its security. Summary Raboo is selling out rapidly, making it an excellent limited-time opportunity.

The Ethereum blockchain hosts numerous projects, which has boosted its popularity. As the second-best crypto coin in terms of market cap, Ethereum’s price has surged over the months. However, is the $4000 price mark within reach? Based on the market data, The Ethereum price rose to a yearly high of $4000 in March before dropping. Its attempt to break through the resistance zone was unsuccessful. In the past weeks, the Ethereum trading volume and market cap has increased leading to speculations of a rally. Although the Ethereum Fear and Greed index is neutral, analysts believe ETH will establish support above $4k in June. Shiba Inu Trading Volume Skyrocket as Rally Is Anticipated Shiba Inu’s massive growth in the past months puts it on the list of best cryptos to buy for long-term profits.

Although momentum appears to be picking up, bulls are not out of the woods just yet. Analysts are not losing hope and remain overly upbeat, expecting a surge that would take the world’s most valuable coin to new levels. Bitcoin Forms A “Cup And Handle” Formation In The Weekly Chart In a post on X, one of them, MikybullCrypto, said Bitcoin has formed a “cup and handle” reversal pattern, suggesting an imminent surge towards new all-time highs. This formation is a glimmer of hope for optimistic traders, especially now that prices have been moving lower and sideways, erasing gains posted in March. BTC forms a cup and handle pattern | Source: @MikybullCrypto via X The “cup and handle” formation is a technical pattern chartists use to identify potential reversals and confirm trend continuations. In the current setup, as identified by the trader on the weekly chart, the “handle” was formed after the recent price drop from all-time highs. The “cup” follows the price decline in 2022 and the subsequent recovery in 2023.

A breakout, reading from the candlestick formation in the daily chart, above these liquidation levels could spark demand, lifting the coin to new levels. Will Miners Dump BTC And Force Prices Lower? However, lurking beneath the optimistic outlook is a potential storm cloud: declining on-chain activity. After the brief spike in on-chain activity on Halving Day due to the launch of the Runes protocol, transaction fees have been declining. According to YCharts, it is currently at $3.206, down from over $128 on April 20. This contraction means miners are getting less revenue, heaping more pressure now that there is more pressure on margins post-Halving. Related Reading XRP To Nearly $600?

Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Is Still Near Historical Top Zone In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the recent trend in the NVT Golden Cross for BTC and its implications for the price. The NVT ratio is an indicator that tells us about how the Bitcoin market cap compares against its transaction volume. The metric is generally used to judge whether the asset’s price is fair or not right now. Related Reading Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Form Capitulation Signal: What It Means 4 days ago When the indicator’s value is high, it suggests the network’s value (that is, the market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins (the volume). Such a trend implies that the asset may be overpriced currently. On the other hand, the low metric means the cryptocurrency’s price may be undervalued due to a rebound as the market cap is low compared to the volume. In the context of the current topic, the NVT ratio itself isn’t of interest; rather, it is a modified form called the NVT Golden Cross. This metric compares the short-term trend (the 10-day moving average) with the long-term trend (30-day MA) of the NVT ratio to identify tops and bottoms. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this Bitcoin indicator over the past couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have been relatively high in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant In the graph, the quant has highlighted the two relevant zones for the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross. It would appear that when this metric is above 2.2, a top can be probable for the cryptocurrency as its price is overvalued in this zone. Similarly, the NVT Golden Cross being under -1.6 can lead to a bottom formation for the asset. The Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has ventured into the red territory for the last couple of months. Each time it has seen a decline out of the zone, it has followed up with another rise into the zone. As such, it hasn’t been able to visit the bullish region yet. At present, the metric has just made another exit out of the top zone, but its value is still quite near it. Thus, while a top may not be especially probable now, a lasting uptrend is also unlikely to happen. Related Reading Bitcoin Price Linked To Binance Vs Coinbase Battle, Quant Reveals 5 days ago It’s possible that Bitcoin won’t be completely out of danger of observing more price drawdowns until the NVT Golden Cross can see a decrease in the green zone.

According to Coinglass, this figure, which reflects the number of outstanding futures contracts, has climbed a staggering 110% since May 1st, reaching a 30-day high of nearly $20 million. This suggests a surge of new market participants entering FLOKI positions, potentially anticipating further price increases. Source: Coinglass Adding fuel to the fire is the significant rise in FLOKI’s daily trading volume. On May 15th, Santiment reported a daily volume exceeding $1 billion, marking the highest level for FLOKI since late March. This intense buying activity indicates a surge in investor interest, pushing the price upwards. Source: Santiment Momentum Indicators Point To A Bullish Charge Further bolstering the case for a bullish FLOKI is the behavior of its key momentum indicators. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Money Flow Index (MFI) currently sit comfortably above their neutral lines, at 62.68 and 65.37 respectively. In simpler terms, these metrics suggest that the price momentum leans towards further gains in the short term. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView Also, the broader market sentiment surrounding FLOKI is notably positive. Increased trading volumes and a surge in social media mentions have amplified investor interest, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is gaining traction not just among retail traders but also institutional investors. Recent partnerships and strategic developments within the FLOKI ecosystem are likely to fuel further growth. These factors, combined with the strong technical indicators, paint a promising picture for FLOKI’s near-term performance, potentially paving the way for substantial price appreciation.

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), an indicator that measures the buying and selling pressure of an asset, paints a rather bearish picture. Still In Negative Zone Despite the price appreciation, FLOKI’s CMF remains firmly in negative territory, currently hovering around -0.11. This suggests that even though the price is rising, the buying pressure might be weakening. This divergence between price and buying pressure is often seen as a sign of a potential reversal, indicating a rally driven by short-term speculation rather than long-term investor confidence.

The attack stole millions of dollars in users’ funds, but the reasons behind it and the exact amount of the loot were unclear. Amid the uncertainty, some claimed that a crypto Robinhood had emerged. Related Reading Bitcoin Still Has “A Lot Of Room To Run Before Reversal,” Says Top Analyst 3 days ago $80 Million Taken In Crypto Heist? On Thursday, the platform Pump.fun announced its bounding curve contracts had been compromised. In the post, the team alerted users that all trading was temporarily halted while they investigated the incident. Pump.fun is a trading platform created to “prevent rugs” by ensuring that all created crypto tokens are safe. The platform allows users to easily launch instantly tradeable tokens with no presale and no team allocation. This solution became an extremely popular alternative among influencers and users who wanted to create tokens without the complexity or high costs of launching a project. It uses bonding curve contracts for the tokens, a mathematical model that determines a token’s price based on supply, increasing with the number of tokens bought. After the token’s market capitalization reaches $69,000, part of the liquidity is deposited on Raydium to be burned. Since the attack, the team has assured users that the contracts have been upgraded to prevent further fund loss, adding that the protocol’s total value locked (TVL) is safe. However, the community’s reports were contradictory and alarming. Some users claimed the attacker had taken $80 million in crypto from the platform’s bonding curve contracts, which worried the affected users. According to Lookonchain’s report, the hacker was quickly identified. At first, he pretended to be an unaware user, asking what the damages were. However, he later accused the platform’s founders of withdrawing the exact amount stolen a day prior. Attacker’s post regarding the exploit. source: Lookonchain on X An X user claimed the individual chose to “be a Robin Hood, dropping hacked cash to $SOL communities.” The attacker also stated in a post his desire to “change the course of history.” However, his “heroic outlaw” endeavors affected 1,882 addresses. What Happened? Despite the speculation and the attacker’s posts, it was later revealed that he was a Pump.fun ex-employee. In its post-mortem post, the platform’s team revealed that the individual had used their position to misappropriate funds from the bonding curve contracts. The attacker illegitimately accessed the accounts after obtaining the private keys, “using their privileged position at the company.” The former employee used flash loans from Solana lending protocol to steal 12,300 SOL, worth around $1.9 million. Per the post, he borrowed SOL to buy as many tokens as possible in Pump.fun. When the tokens hit 100% on their respective bonding curves, the attacker used the keys to access the bonding curve liquidity and repay the flash loans. Fortunately, the attacker could only access $1.9 million out of the $45 million liquidity in contracts. Since then, the team has redeployed the bonding curve contracts and offered a plan to help affected crypto investors.

Short-Term Holder Bitcoin Whales Have Continued To Accumulate Recently As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the demand among the short-term holder whales has decreased since the all-time high, although it still continues to remain strong. Related Reading Buy Or Sell Bitcoin? Quant Reveals What Leading Metric Says 6 days ago The “short-term holders” (STHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. This cohort includes the new investors in the market, as well as the fickle-minded traders who make moves often and don’t tend to HODL. The investors who make it past the 155-day threshold are put inside the “long-term holders” (LTHs), which is a group that’s generally considered to reflect the resolute side of the sector. In the context of the current discussion, the investors of interest aren’t the ordinary STHs, but rather the humongous entities called whales. Formally, these investors are defined as those holding more than 1,000 BTC in their wallets. At the current exchange rate, this lower limit is worth $61.5 million, which is massive indeed. Whales can be influential beings on the network because of these large holdings, so their behavior can be something worth keeping an eye on. The STH whales would naturally correspond to the large holders who only bought within the past five months. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the exchange outflows being made by these new whales in the Bitcoin market over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been sharply going down in recent weeks | Source: @AxelAdlerJr on X As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin STH whale exchange outflows had spiked to pretty high levels earlier in the year, when the rally towards the new all-time high (ATH) price had taken place. Naturally, this spike would suggest demand for buying the cryptocurrency was high from new whale investors entering the space. At the peak, the indicator implied accumulation was occurring at the rate of a whopping 452,000 BTC per week. Related Reading Bitcoin Will Be Set For New ATHs If It Breaks This Resistance: Analyst 6 days ago A part of this buying would correspond to the demand coming in from the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – new investment vehicles for Bitcoin only approved at the start of this year that provide for an indirect way to invest into the asset in a format that may be preferrable for the more traditional investors. From the chart, it’s visible that the demand from the new whales has seen a clear decline in the period since the ATH, but accumulation nonetheless remains substantial as the STH whales are still potentially buying at a rate of around 200,000 BTC per week.

    "content": "Crypto analyst Crypto Jebb recently highlighted an inverse heads and shoulders pattern that had formed on the Bitcoin chart. This bullish pattern indicates another rally may be on the horizon for the flagship crypto, which could send its price to $100,000. How Could Bitcoin Could Rise To $100,000 Crypto Jebb revealed in a video on his YouTube channel that the inverse heads-and-shoulders pattern he had been predicting for a while had finally formed on the charts. He predicts this pattern could lead to a price breakout, sending Bitcoin’s price to $70,000. The analyst also noted that the price target of the bullish pattern is at $75,000, which indicates that Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high (ATH) on its next leg up. Related Reading End Of The Road For BNB After 200% Surge? Mounting Resistance Threatens Rally 3 days ago Crypto Jebb mentioned that there is a “great degree of likelihood” that Bitcoin would experience a major rally, which would send it to $100,000 should it break its current ATH of $73,800. The crypto analyst believes that Bitcoin’s rise to that price level is very likely, considering that it has seen a “pretty large corrective movement” since hitting a new ATH over two months ago. The crypto analyst warned that there is a scenario where Bitcoin could also end up trading sideways between $60,000 and $64,000, which would signal a period of consolidation. He noted that Bitcoin could even drop lower during this period. However, Bitcoin’s outlook is generally bullish based on the technical indicators that crypto Jebb highlighted. The analyst highlighted the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), which he noted is turning “very bullish” on the daily chart and shows that the bulls are regaining control. He also claimed that Bitcoin is witnessing a ‘green red green’ formation on the daily chart, indicating that the crypto token is “doing very well.” BTC Is In “Very Bullish Territory Crypto Jebb mentioned that Bitcoin is currently in very bullish territory, especially since Altcoins are also rallying. He claims this indicates a “great degree of confidence” in the market at the moment. The crypto analyst also noted that the stock market just broke an all-time high, which he stated is big news for Bitcoin. Related Reading PEPE Whales Go On Massive 720B Shopping Spree Amid Campaign For New ATHs, Is It Time To Get In? 3 days ago He explained that this is big news for Bitcoin because the flagship crypto follows the stock market and moves significantly whenever the stock market experiences a breakout. As such, with the stock market breaking its ATH, he expects Bitcoin to do so soon enough. Crypto Jebb further explained that the rationale behind Bitcoin following the stock market is that investors are more confident in investing in risk-on assets when they see that the risk-off (the stock market) is doing so well. Crypto Jebb predicts that Bitcoin will become a risk-off asset in the next ten to twenty years. When that happens, he predicts that hundreds of billions of dollars in investment will be made in the flagship crypto.

    "content": "AI cryptos are on the march in 2024, with many taking flight in recent weeks to buck the trend of slumping prices across the crypto market. For instance, the Render price has surged by over 40% in the past week to break through the $10 barrier. After recently setting a new ATH of $13.15 in March, experts are examining how other AI cryptos, such as Bittensor, perform and whether we’re entering a new golden era led by AI. Render price is surging; is a new ATH in sight? Render has been on a roll in 2024, with the Render price steadily climbing. This platform uses GPUs to allow artists, creatives, and studios to render complicated 3D animations and visual effects through its decentralized community. Instead of investing in costly computing equipment, users can rent high-power processing equipment at a fraction of the cost. As one of the next-generation AI cryptos, Render has caught the imagination, with the Render price surging from $1.7128 twelve months ago to its current value of $10.67, an increase of over 400% in twelve months. As the AI crypto revolution gains pace, market analysts believe more gains could be around the corner as they forecast new ATHs for the Render price in the second half of 2024. Bittensor: Democratization across the AI data economy Another new generation of AI cryptos that will gain popularity in the first half of 2024 is Bittensor, with its unique decentralized platform where machine learning models can interact and learn from each other. Bittensor allows nodes, known as neurons, to share insights and data to improve algorithms through automated collaboration. Bittensor’s approach improves machine learning technologies through its new data economy model and boosts the decentralization of AI cryptos. Bittensor is trading at $390.81 at press time, up over 900% compared to a year ago when it was trading at just $37.9756. Experts believe Bittensor could return above the $700 mark it achieved as recently as March 2024 in the second half of this year. Raboo: Meme coin pioneer could be next of the breakout AI cryptos The surge in AI cryptos is causing more new projects to appear on the market. One of these is Raboo, a brand-new meme coin that combines AI meme generation with SocialFi mechanics, providing a new space for meme enthusiasts to grow a vibrant new crypto community. While using Raboo’s proprietary AI content generation technology, users can monetize their creations using the platform’s unique post-to-earn program. With over 5,000 members already signed up to the Raboo community, they can also gain rewards through competitions, prize draws, and regular airdrops. The Raboo presale is selling out rapidly, with the price already rising from $0.003 to $0.0042 at the time of writing. With over $1 million already raised, Raboo is a meme coin with genuine top-20 crypto prospects and 100x growth potential this year. Conclusion As AI cryptos push boundaries within the market, the Render price continues to surge, while Bittensor investors can look forward to future gains. However, the new meme coin prospect Raboo could be the best of the lot, given its 100x growth potential later this year. You can participate in the Raboo presale here.

    "content": "Crypto whales are making moves following the recent bear market. With Bitcoin increasing to $66,000, experts believe several projects could see significant rallies over the next few weeks. Three projects that have already caught whale attention are Chainlink, Rollblock, and Binance Coin (BNB). With all projects already in the green, experts believe they could see significant rallies, with Rollblock poised for returns of over 720%. Chainlink Passes 100% Annual Returns Chainlink’s impressive performance has continued in Q2, taking the altcoin’s annual returns to 107%. This milestone has triggered an influx of new investors, and Chainlink’s daily trading volume is up by 25.95% over the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, Chainlink was trading at $13.82 and boasted a market cap of $8.1 Billion. Since its launch in 2017, Chainlink has showcased exceptional growth, outperforming many of the market’s top cryptocurrencies. Following its recent rally, experts believe that Chainlink could pass $20 in 2024. As a result, crypto whales are doubling down on Chainlink (LINK) tokens to optimize their portfolios. Binance Successfully Implements New Security Protocol Binance recently implemented an “antidote” to the growing problem of address poisoning. This is when an investor is tricked into sending funds to a fraudulent address. This new algorithm has already been a huge success and has identified over 13.4 million spoofed addresses. This is a huge boost to the Binance Coin ecosystem. Given that crypto scams are on the rise, this development brings a much-needed sense of security to Binance Coin and the Binance Smart Chain. Since this update, Binance Coin’s price has increased by 2.29%, and Binance Coin (BNB) is now trading at $580.85. Having already experienced a strong performance in 2024, experts believe that Binance Coin (BNB) could be one of the market’s top cryptos in May. But how does Binance Coin compare to Rollblock? Why Are Crypto Whales Flocking to Rollblock? Rollblock is attracting cryptocurrency whales with its GambleFi protocol. This innovative project is one of the first to apply blockchain technology to the gambling industry, and its impact could be pivotal. By using blockchain technology, Rollblock is able to solve major industry issues such as transparency and security. Rollblock has already launched its casino, which showcases over 150 different games. The platform is fully licensed and will also introduce sports betting options over the next few months. These will cover major sports, including MMA, golf, boxing, soccer, and the NFL. One reason whales are buying Rollblock is its revenue share opportunity. Rollblock will share up to 30% of its daily revenue with $RBLK token holders. It will do this by using revenue to buy back $RBLK tokens on the open market, burning half of the tokens it buys. The remaining half will be used for staking rewards, offering some of the most lucrative passive income opportunities in the crypto market. This could become a great way for investors to build passive income streams and has been a key factor in Rollblock’s rapid growth. Currently in stage 2 of its presale, investors can buy $RBLK tokens for just $0.012. Experts believe tokens could increase in value by 720% during the Rollblock presale, and as a result, tokens are in high demand. Crypto Whales Take Advantage of Rollblock Returns Rollblock has a long-term roadmap in place, with big plans to pioneer developments in the gambling industry. With little competition, experts believe that Rollblock could quickly become one of the world’s top cryptocurrencies. With the price of RBLK expected to increase up to 880% in the presale alone, many investors are choosing to buy early to maximize their returns.

    "summary": "Fantom emerged as one of the best performers in the cryptocurrency market over the past week, posting a substantial 26% price increase.\n",
    "content": "Fantom price has been such a joy to watch for investors in recent days, as a much-needed breath of fresh air continues to spread throughout the crypto market. Bitcoin and other large-cap assets seem to be recovering well after a period of sluggish and frustrating price action. Notably, Fantom emerged as one of the best performers in the cryptocurrency market over the past week, posting a substantial 26% price increase in the last seven days. The Layer 1 token has particularly been on a hot streak in the past day, soaring by 15%. The Catalyst Behind The Latest FTM Surge The much-awaited Sonic upgrade has been critical to the turnaround the Fantom price has witnessed in the past few months. Sonic is expected to improve Fantom’s technology stack and introduce major scalability enhancements without a disruptive hard fork. Related Reading This Crypto Trader Just Sold All His Bitcoin For Altcoins Like Cardano And XRP, Here’s Why 1 day ago Most recently, the Fantom Foundation unveiled the details of the upcoming layer-1 chain Sonic Network. According to the blog post, the new blockchain network will be connected to and be able to tap into vast amounts of liquidity, users, and protocols from “Ethereum and beyond” via a native layer-2 bridge. As disclosed previously, the Sonic Network is expected to go live alongside a new token, with the ticker S. In the latest memo, the project revealed that FTM token holders will be able to migrate Sonic’s token at a 1:1 ratio, depending on the results of a governance vote. The Fantom Foundation said in its latest blog post: Initially, this migration process is anticipated to be bi-directional, which will allow users to swap back and forth between $FTM and $S. Since the $S token will only exist on Sonic and $FTM will only exist on Opera, we anticipate utilizing a bridge to enable bi-directional swaps. This process enables a seamless migration for current Opera network participants to experience Sonic. After a transitional period (to be determined in the future), the migration process is expected to transition to a one-way migration of $FTM to $S. The project noted that the supply of the new S token will match that of FTM to facilitate the token migration process after the Sonic chain launch. It is worth mentioning that the Fantom price experienced a significant surge following this update on the Sonic Network on May 17. Fantom Price At A Glance As of this writing, the Fantom price is around $0.908, reflecting an almost 15% increase in the past 24 hours.

    "content": "AGIX is one of the leading AI tokens in the crypto space with a total supply of 2 billion, and a total trading volume of over $105 million, which is over 11% down in the last 24 hours. For over two days, the price of AGIX has been holding strong above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The token which has been on a downward ally for quite some days, is showing some signs of price reversal and if this happens a change of direction might occur and the price of AGIX will start a new movement upward. As of the time of writing, AGIX was trading around $0.98817 above the 100-day simple moving average, about 1.68% up in the last 24 hours. Currently, there are two main resistance levels of $0.99038 and $1.04237 and two main support levels of $0.82620 and $0.75779, respectively. Technical Indicators Suggest Upward Rally For AGIX 4-Hour MACD: A technical look at the MACD indicator from the 4-hour timeframe, the MACD histograms are trending above the zero line, and both the MACD line and the Signal line have crossed and are trending above the MACD zero line, indicating a bullish trend. This can be seen in the below image. 4-Hour RSI: The formation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the above image also suggests that the price of AGIX is bullish as the RSI signal line is seen trending above the 50% level. This indicates that buyers are active in the market therefore overpowering the strength of sellers. Alligator Indicator on the 4-hour timeframe: A look at the alligator indicator from the 4-hour time frame shows that the price is trading above the alligator lines as the alligator lip and teeth have both successfully crossed above the alligator jaw, suggesting that the price might continue to move in an upward direction. Support And Resistance Levels To Break Conclusively, the price of AGIX is currently trading around the $0.99038 resistance level and if it manages to break above this level, AGIX’s price will continue to move further toward the $1.04237 resistance level and if it breaks above this level, an upward trend might begin. However, should the price of AGIX fail to break these resistance levels, it will reverse and start a downward movement toward its previous support level of $0.82620. If it manages to break below this support level, the price might move further to test the $0.75779 support level.

    "content": "An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could be positioned for new all-time highs (ATHs) if it can break through this on-chain resistance level. Bitcoin On-Chain Data Could Suggest This Level Holds Major Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed Bitcoin’s current on-chain resistance. In on-chain analysis, the strength of support and resistance levels is based on the total amount of cryptocurrency last acquired at each level. Below is a chart for Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric, which shows the supply distribution across the various price levels based on where the investors bought their coins. How the cost basis distribution in the BTC market looks like at the moment | Source: @ali_charts on X From the graph, it’s visible that in terms of the levels currently ahead of the spot price, the $66,250 mark stands out as it hosts the cost basis of over 2% of all Bitcoin UTXOs. Generally, the cost basis is a special level for any investor, and they are naturally more likely to react when it is retested, as it can lead to a flip in their profit-loss situation. The spot price retesting a level won’t produce much reaction if only a few investors share their cost basis around the level. Still, if many holders bought there, the cryptocurrency could see visible effects upon a retest. Investors who are losing money may look forward to such a retest to exit out at their break-even point, as they may fear that the asset will fall back down again in the future, so getting away with their initial capital would seem like the ideal decision. As such, a retest of a level dense with UTXOs from below can lead to a selling reaction in the market, making these levels points of strong resistance for Bitcoin. Since the $66,250 level appears to be where the most coins were purchased out of the levels ahead, this level could be the toughest one to break for the cryptocurrency. On the brighter side, though, the levels after this point are relatively thin. “Once BTC breaks past this level, it will be positioned for new all-time highs!” explains the analyst. The market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has also discussed about on-chain cost basis distribution in an X post today. As revealed by the firm, around 10% of all addresses acquired their coins between the current spot price and the all-time high the asset set back in March. Looks like a large amount of supply was purchased at the levels near the ATH | Source: IntoTheBlock on X This would naturally mean that 10% of the total addresses, equivalent to 5.16 million, are in the red on the Bitcoin network.

    "content": "Crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe recently revealed that he had sold all his Bitcoin and rotated his capital to altcoins. The analyst explained the reason for this move and remarked that he was doing this to acquire more of the flagship crypto later on. Why This Analyst Swapped His Bitcoin For Altcoins In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Van de Poppe explained that altcoins have been “crushed unreasonably hard.” As such, he believes things can only improve from here on, noting that the “upside (for these altcoins) can’t be denied.” Related Reading Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run 2 days ago Based on his explanation, the analyst suggested that these altcoins will likely outperform Bitcoin from here on as the flagship crypto already had its moment before the halving when crypto natives swapped their altcoins for Bitcoin. Before now, Van de Poppe had already predicted that altcoins would make a bounce in their Bitcoin pairs post-halving. He also mentioned back then that there would be a narrative shift to Ethereum. More recently, he indicated that the news around the Spot Ethereum ETF would trigger a rally for Ethereum and other altcoins. While explaining his decision to swap his Bitcoins, he again touched on this and hinted that Ethereum would be integral to any move these altcoins make. Van de Poppe claimed everyone expects the worst, that the Spot Ethereum ETF applications will be denied because the SEC considers the crypto token a security. Therefore, he believes the market is already priced in accordingly and can only recover from here on, even if the SEC eventually rejects the applications. The crypto analyst further claimed that the markets could make a “significant U-turn” if the news ends up being slightly better than a rejection. He also highlighted other developments that could help trigger this move. One is the FIT21 bill, which the House will soon vote on. This bill is expected to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets in the United States. Van de Poppe also noted that the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple is coming to a “final stage” and predicts that the crypto firm will likely secure a final victory, which could also help provide a major boost for these altcoins. Meanwhile, he expects that Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) and Real World Assets (RWA) will be “massive,” with traditional companies transitioning into the Web3 ecosystem. As such, Van de Poppe urged his followers to “allocate” themselves if they wanted to “make a large return.” Van De Poppe’s Big Bet It is worth noting that Van de Poppe’s decision to swap his Bitcoins for altcoins isn’t an end in itself but a means to an end. The crypto expert hopes to make a return of 300% to 900% on his investment in the coming six to twelve months. Van de Poppe hinted that he would rotate his capital back to Bitcoin after this period and predicted that he could make another 300% to 600% return on his investment as long as Bitcoin stabilizes. Related Reading Crypto Expert Willy Woo Predicts Bitcoin Has Room To Run – Here Are The Drivers 1 day ago He warned of the risk of taking such a bet, revealing that he is currently down around 20% on his overall investment. He also remarked that he could still post more losses on his investment, considering these altcoins could still experience further declines from their current price levels. However, Van de Poppe added that he is fine with whatever the outcome of his investment is. Again, he reaffirmed that he is “happily allocating” his entire capital towards altcoins and concluded by stating that the bull cycle will be “glorious.” Altcoin market cap drops to $1.04 trillion | Source: Crypto total market cap excluding BTC from Tradingview.com Chart from Tradingview.com\n",

    "content": "Current crypto market analysis reveals important price levels on the Avalanche price chart which traders need to keep an eye on, whereas the Render market cap recently decreased by a substantial 10% amid its positive monthly price trend. However, KangaMoon is making waves in the meme coin space with its creative and practical strategy. The trajectories of these coins may be different, but they continue to capture investors’ attention. Let’s find out why. Avalanche Price Analysis Important support and resistance levels are shown on the Avalanche price chart, which displays the price activity of Avalanche over a range of periods. The Avalanche price right now is about $32. A drop below the $30 region would set off a chain reaction of liquidations and further decrease prices. Critical support is found at $30.74, which is close to the $30 mark and in line with the 0.618 Fibonacci line. Keeping an eye on these levels might assist traders and investors in projecting future price fluctuations. Three important resistance levels are $39.78, $34.06 (100 EMA), and $33.26 (200 EMA). The 4-hour timeframe’s EMA 100 and 200 are noteworthy because they may serve as trendline resistance during a negative trend. Render Price Poses For Bullish Move Render has been seeing some positive trends lately. Remarkably, Render disclosed that a recent Apple keynote highlighted its Octane X project. Customers of Apple devices can now fully utilize M4’s substantial rendering power thanks to this release. This crypto could see a surge in value as a result of the positive Render news. Meanwhile, the Render market cap has decreased by 10% to reach $3.90 billion despite a 440% increase in the Render price within the last year. In addition, the Render token is flashing green on over 26 technical indicators. Thus, before the conclusion of Q2 of 2024, market analysts estimate a spike to $13.45. KangaMoon (KANG) Is One Of The Meme Coin Titans KangaMoon (KANG) is making waves in the meme coin space with its creative and practical strategy. Unlike meaningless traditional memecoins, KANG serves as the in-game currency for the upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) game.

    "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been on a hot streak in the past few days, with several large-cap assets posting significant gains in the past week. Most notably, the Bitcoin price bounced back from around $61,000 to above $67,000 for the first time in nearly a month. As expected, this latest price movement has sparked a lot of speculation and discussion around the premier cryptocurrency. Popular blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant has shared on-chain insights into the recent Bitcoin price rally and its future trajectory. How Did Bitcoin Price Reach $67,000? In a recent report, CryptoQuant revealed the catalyst and on-chain manifestations behind BTC’s latest rally to above $67,000. According to the analytics firm, the price of Bitcoin rode to its new highs on the back of the news of lower-than-expected inflation in the United States.

Indicators Suggest Upward Momentum Ahead 2 days ago The inflation data released on Wednesday, May 15 showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in April – lower than the expected 0.4%. This revelation suggested that inflation might be on a downward slope in the US, making risky assets like Bitcoin more attractive. ? #Bitcoin\u0027s price has rallied from $60K to around $66K, driven by lower-than-expected US inflation and reduced selling pressure. Let\u0027s look into the details ?? — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 17, 2024 In its report, CryptoQuant revealed that there has been a decreased selling pressure in the BTC market, as short-term holders are selling at low or negative profits. Meanwhile, Bitcoin balances at over-the-counter (OTC) desks have steadied, implying that fewer coins are entering the open market. What’s more, the analytics platform highlighted a particular on-chain signal that might have predicted the recent Bitcoin price rally. According to CryptoQuant, BTC miners have been extremely underpaid over the past few weeks, which often correlates with price bottoms. The Catalysts For Sustained BTC Rally? CryptoQuant, in its report, identified potential catalysts for a continued rally for the Bitcoin price. According to the on-chain data company, demand from permanent holders and largest investors is on the rise but it needs to climb rapidly to push the price of BTC even higher. Related Reading Crypto Post-Mortem: Here’s How Pump.Fun Was Exploited For $2 Million 2 days ago Furthermore, the latest data shows that Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded funds) purchases have dwindled to nearly zero daily, while stablecoin liquidity growth is also on a decline. CryptoQuant noted that these two metrics need a jolt, which might be critical for a sustained Bitcoin rally. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price continues to hover around $67,000, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency is up by a significant 10% in the past week.

    "content": "Meme coins have become a huge part of the crypto community in recent years, with more than 50 launched in the past year. Two networks that are currently hosting meme coins include Solana and Binance Smart Chain. The question now is which of them will dominate the meme coin cycle in the coming months. In other news, Rollblock has become one of the best DeFi projects after introducing a new GambleFi protocol. The blockchain casino game is getting a huge number of followers, and analysts are optimistic that this trend will go on. Solana (SOL) Becomes One of the Best Chains for Meme coins In the past few years, a myriad of memecoins has flooded the Solana (SOL) blockchain, with names like Dogwifhat, Bonk, and Book of Memes among the top meme coins. The Solana blockchain has been a bedrock for these meme coins, offering them fast transactions and top-notch security. At the moment, three of its meme coins – Dogwifhat, Bonk, and Book of Memes are part of the top 10 meme coins in the market. New memecoins are expected to join the Solana network in the coming months. Binance Smart Chain (BNB) Yet To Gain Grounds in the Meme Coin Market Compared to Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BNB) is still grasping at straws in the meme coin space. Some of the notable memecoins that have been launched on the Binance Smart Chain network are Rich Quack, SafeMoon, and Memecoin. Of these three, only one Memecoin is part of the top 10. The others are still struggling to gain momentum. Earlier this year, Binance Labs invested in Memecoin to develop the Memeland ecosystem. At the moment, there has not been much memecoin activity on the Binance Smart Chain network. Rollblock (RBLK) Projected To Dominate the DeFi Market Rollblock (RBLK) is shaking up the online casino gaming sector as the next big thing in the DeFi market. It is licensed and secure, offering players peace of mind without the hassle of KYC checks. Unlike others, Rollblock shares its success with RBLK token holders, giving them a chance to earn up to 30% of the casino’s weekly revenue. The project buys back tokens from the market using its generated revenue. Whatever the number of these tokens is, 50% of it is then burned, and the other 50% is given as staking rewards to the Rollblock community. The positioning of RBLK in the online gambling market, which is expected to reach $744 billion by 2028, makes it the best coin to invest in. Rollblock is a fully licensed operator that guarantees the safety of the players and, at the same time, gets a global audience. Besides, it contains state-of-the-art encryption and blockchain technology. Players need not be afraid while using the platform, as their data is safe and secured. Now, the RBLK token of Rollblock is in its second presale stage, and it is priced at only $0.012. It is the best coin to invest in because of the advantages it provides within the system. RBLK is a tool for getting into games and doing transactions on the platform. To sum up, RBLK is a great crypto for traders who are aiming to increase their profits in the next few months. Conclusion Solana’s speed, security, and low fees are the reasons why it has become one of the preferred networks for meme coins. Contrarily, Binance Smart Chain is still fighting to break through the meme coin market. Its memecoins are far behind the SOL-based memecoins. In the meantime, Rollblock is gaining popularity in the DeFi market because of its new DeFi project that aims to revolutionize the casino industry. Investors who are in search of a fully licensed casino platform to play casino games and make money can join Rollblock by buying the RBLK token.The price of RBLK is expected to increase by over 800% in the presale alone.

    "type": "unknownType",
    "summary": "Some analysts consider that Bitcoin may finally be out of a dangerous zone after its recent performance displayed bullish signals.\n",
    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) began the month with the deepest retrace of the cycle, falling to the $56,000 support level. The retrace raised alarms for some crypto investors and market watchers, who feared the bull run had ended. Since then, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recovered crucial levels, and analysts have identified bullish patterns on BTC’s chart, suggesting that it might finally be out of the woods. Related Reading Analyst Points Out Level To Beat If Bitcoin Is To Reach $76,000 6 days ago Is Bitcoin Out Of Danger? As the May 1st retrace developed, crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted the similarities between Bitcoin’s 2016 and 2024 post-halving performances. He suggested that the flagship cryptocurrency’s price development came “as no surprise,” as it was mirroring the “post-Halving Bitcoin Danger Zone” of 2016. Per the analyst, the “Danger Zone” is officially over, which BTC is “celebrating with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support.” He stated that May could be an “unremarkable” month for the largest cryptocurrency, potentially continuing next month. However, Bitcoin is “running out of unremarkable months” before the beginning of this cycle’s “Parabolic Phase.” Additionally, Rekt Capital considers that BTC’s sell-side momentum is starting to show signs of slowing down, “slowly developing a curl against the $60,000 support.” Per the post, Bitcoin must continue to hold this support zone for the curl to “progress and eventually lift up.” BTC\u0027s curl pattern developing. Source: Rekt Capital Similarly, analyst Bluntz identified a bullish engulfing pattern on Thursday, considering there would be “a solid engulfing on the daily close.” To the analyst, it appeared that the “next push-up into ATH has started.” This morning, Bluntz confirmed the pattern formation and announced to his followers that this cycle’s Round 2 began, which would lead to a “fresh ATH.” BTC’s Strength Could Lead The Price To 6-Figures Following the bullish analysis, CryptoJelle stated that BTC “is looking good.” Per his post, the cryptocurrency “has nearly completed a full reset,” as it’s back to the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Additionally, the chart displays a “bullish MACD cross” below the zero line and the “first higher low in a long time,” suggesting a positive divergence. Jelle highlights that BTC’s price is again pushing into the trendline that “has pushed prices lower over the past weeks.” Despite the higher low, he points out the necessity of reclaiming the $63,000 support zone before new highs come. For these new highs, he set an $82,000 target for BTC’s price, suggesting that a 6-figure price for the flagship cryptocurrency is possible during this cycle. #Bitcoin is pushing into the trendline that has pushed prices lower over the past weeks — once again. Looks like a higher low has been put in, but we still need to break $63,000 convincingly. Chop city until that happens. Stick to the plan. pic.twitter.com/ClTuv8QmhO — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) May 13, 2024 The analyst emphasizes Bitcoin’s performance this cycle, stating that the community has under-appreciated its strength during this bull run. He considers that the run is not over, as the “Halving” event occurred just a few weeks ago, and BTC’s price has been consolidating around the previous cycle’s all-time high for a long period.

    "content": "The Bitcoin Halving event is now one month behind us, but the market is still waiting for solid signs of recovery. To attest to this is the fact that the Binance coin has seen a significant decrease in value, further adding fuel to the fire on the market. Right now it’s sitting at $569, which is a 5% decrease compared to last week, highlighting major underperformance compared to the global cryptocurrency market. However, you can still make profits in this bearish environment. Top market experts are saying that the future is in the meme coin market. More specifically in Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), and WienerAI ($WAI) projects. Let’s check out the details. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Binance Coin (BNB) Has Seen Significant Drops in the Past Week – These Hot New Presales Could Save the Day The forefront of the market has long been occupied by BNB, thanks to its close ties with Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. It used to be seen as one of the most stable coins, with minimal price fluctuations. However, recent times have seen a significant shift. Binance Coin experienced substantial drops over the past week, plummeting well below the $600 mark. One contributing factor to this sudden downturn is the recent series of major crypto-related arrests. Ontario’s ‘’Crypto King’’, Aiden Pleterski, was arrested on fraud charges following an 18-month investigation. Authorities found evidence of money laundering using investor funds. Similarly, two US citizens were apprehended for a lightning-fast theft totaling over $25 million. The brothers Anton and James Peraire-Bueno, aided by corrupt IRS agents, allegedly engaged in money fraud and wire laundering. If found guilty, they could face up to 20 years in prison. Despite these setbacks, there are still profit opportunities, especially in the booming meme coin market. Analysts are pointing to new presales as the next big thing, with tokens like Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), WienerAI ($WAI), and Sealana ($SEAL) showing potential for x100 returns. Let’s see the details of each token below. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Best Meme Coin Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) Brings New Innovation to the Market as the First Multi-chain Token Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) stands out as the pioneer in multi-blockchain functionality among coins. Its groundbreaking technology seamlessly integrates across 6 major blockchains, a feat never seen before in the crypto realm. Inspired by the successful models of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Dogeverse adopts the beloved dog avatar concept, featuring a quirky space doge navigating the vast crypto landscapes. This character symbolizes the freedom and agility within the crypto space, effortlessly moving between blockchains. The presale phase of Dogeverse witnessed unprecedented success, raking in millions shortly after its ICO launch in April. As of now, the project has amassed over $15 million and is rapidly approaching its hard cap of $17 million, signaling the high demand and investor interest. One of Dogeverse’s strengths is its strong community support, boasting nearly 20,000 followers on X. This massive following is not surprising, given that 25% of the total 200 billion tokens are dedicated to marketing, ensuring widespread visibility and engagement. Investors opting to stake $DOGEVERSE tokens can enjoy various rewards and benefits, with annual percentage yields reaching up to 72% Currently priced at $0.00031 per coin, buying $DOGEVERSE tokens at this stage presents a favorable opportunity, especially considering the anticipated exponential surge in price post-listing. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Dogeverse Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Sealana ($SEAL) is the Future for Solana Based Meme Coins With a Familiar Mascot and Successful ICO Sealana ($SEAL) is a plump seal diving deep into the Solana Sea’s mysteries. He’s glued to his PC, growing larger by the day, fueled by chips and canned tuna. His obsession? Finding the best Solana meme coins, keeping his flippers busy. Inspired by South Park’s World of Warcraft episode, Sealana is the newest SOL meme coin with a ‘Send to Wallet’ presale. Rumor has it that it’s from the same creators behind the viral SLERF token that blew up in March 2024. To get $SEAL, you can use the website widget or send SOL directly to the presale wallet. After the presale, you’ll get token airdrops. Right now, $SEAL is a steal at $0.022, but prices will rise during the presale. It’s smart to get in early. And if you’re sending tokens to Sealana’s wallet, use a DEX wallet to qualify for the airdrop. But what really sets Sealana apart is its community. Unlike other projects, $SEAL fans are active and engaged, sharing memes and insights. This lively atmosphere makes Sealana more than just a meme coin—it’s a community-driven adventure in the crypto world. In short, Sealana isn’t just riding the hype; it’s a symbol of community, innovation, and a bit of seal spirit. Whether you’re a crypto pro or just curious, consider joining Sealana’s journey and see where it takes you in the Solana Sea. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Sealana Now \u003c\u003c\u003c WienerAI ($WAI) is the Next Big Doge-Themed Token Aiming to Combine Crypto and AI WienerAI ($WAI) emerges as the next-gen doge-themed token, integrating cutting-edge AI technology into its framework. Currently, in its presale phase, WienerAI is set to undergo multiple stages. In the ongoing phase, investors can acquire 1 $WAI for $0.000707. This phase is swiftly approaching its conclusion, having already raised close to $2 million within just a month. With only $150,000 remaining to bridge the gap, the next phase promises significant price escalations. Staking is a pivotal aspect of WienerAI, offering generous rewards for token holders. While it’s expected that APYs will decrease as more users adopt the token, early investors stand to benefit from this advantageous opportunity. Down the road, WienerAI plans to integrate an AI bot into its platform, enhancing trade predictions and overall functionality. This forward-looking approach adds another layer of appeal for potential investors interested in the project’s long-term vision and innovation. \u003e\u003e\u003e Buy Wiener AI Now \u003c\u003c\u003c Conclusion The recent market dip of the famous Binance coin has left investors feeling uneasy about their future finances. However, many experts are optimistic that there are still big profits to be made, more notably in the meme coin market. If you want to jump on the opportunity early, top analysts recommend considering investments in Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), WienerAI ($WAI), and Sealana ($SEAL). Grab these tokens before prices skyrocket after the presale ends. Being among the first to invest could lead to significant gains as these tokens will surely gain traction in the market.\n",

    "content": "Crypto expert Willy Woo has predicted that Bitcoin will still make significant moves to the upside. He made this claim based on an indicator that suggests crypto investors are still willing to buy the flagship crypto at higher prices. Related Reading Filecoin On Fire: Analyst Torches Doubters With $15 Target 2 days ago Bitcoin Still Has “A Lot Of Room To Run” Woo mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin still has a lot of room to run before the flagship crypto experiences a reversal or consolidation. To support his bullish sentiment, he shared a chart highlighting Bitcoin VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price). The crypto analyst further suggested that bulls were firmly in control, stating that he would hate to be a “trapped Bitcoin bear right now.” The VWAP measures the average price of Bitcoin over a specific period and factors in the volume at each price level to determine the current sentiment in the market. The chart Woo shared showed that Bitcoin’s VWAP was currently on an upward trajectory. In a subsequent X post, Woo highlighted Bitcoin’s risk signal to further reinforce his bullish sentiment. He noted that Bitcoin is still in the early stages in its liquidity cycle and is still doing “warm-up exercises.” He added that Bitcoin’s long-term frame risk signal is relatively low as it is still consolidating under all-time highs. He claimed that this risk “only starts climbing after the floodgates open,” meaning that the best is yet to come for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the wave of profit-taking by Bitcoin investors (since the crypto hit a new all-time high in March) looks to be done, which indicates that Bitcoin may be ready for its next leg up. Woo confirmed that profit-taking has been completed as he provided an update on Bitcoin’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). He noted that Bitcoin is undergoing a “very healthy reset, against a backdrop of capital flows into the network climbing again.” Bitcoin is now trading at $66.996. Chart: TradingView Other Bullish Indicators For Bitcoin Crypto analyst Crypto Jebb recently highlighted an inverse heads and shoulders pattern that had formed on Bitcoin’s chart. The analyst claimed this bullish pattern could send Bitcoin’s price to $100,000. The analyst also noted several other indicators currently signaling a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. One is the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), which he claimed had turned very bullish on the daily chart and indicated that the bulls were regaining control. He also highlighted a ‘green red green’ formation on the daily chart, which, according to Crypto Jebb, shows that Bitcoin is “doing very well.” Related Reading Crypto Alert: VeChain Bull Run Imminent, Expert Predicts 500% Rally 2 days ago Meanwhile, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto highlighted a striking similarity between Bitcoin’s 2020 post-halving price action and its price action after this halving.

    "content": "While upbeat U.S. inflation data released early this week has restored institutional faith in bitcoin’s (BTC) long-term bullish case, it is yet to alleviate concerns of a near-term price pullback.\nThe odds of a near-term rally are still scant, according to CF Benchmarks’ analysis of options trading data on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a platform widely regarded as a barometer of institutional activity.\nAccording to CF Benchmarks, implied volatility for short-dated out-of-the-money (OTM) put options was higher than implied volatility for OTM calls following Wednesday’s softer-than-expected U.S. CPI release. These options are based on CME’s cash-settled standard bitcoin futures contract, which is sized at 5 BTC.\n“The volatility skew, which represents the difference in implied volatility between out-of-the-money (OTM) puts and calls is quite pronounced in the shorter-dated options. The higher implied volatility [demand] for OTM puts compared to calls suggests investors are still cautious about near-term downside risks and are willing to pay a premium for protective puts,” CF Benchmarks said in a note shared with CoinDesk on Thursday.\nPut options are derivative contracts that protect the buyer from price drops. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, looking to profit from or hedge against potential price weakness. A call option offers insurance against price rallies. Put options at strikes lower than the going market rate and calls above the spot market price are considered out-of-the-money.\nImplied volatility is an estimate of the future volatility of the underlying asset based on options prices. Implied volatility rises as demand for options increases.\nCF Benchmarks is the U.K.-regulated provider of digital assets benchmarks like the CF Bitcoin Volatility Index. CF Benchmarks and CME also publish several crypto-related reference rates, including the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate and CME CF-Ether Dollar Reference Rate.\nThe volatility surface – a three-dimensional plot of the implied volatilities of bitcoin options – shows implied volatilities for short- and long-dated bitcoin options with different deltas or degrees of sensitivity to changes in the price of bitcoin. OTM options’ delta ranges from 0.5 to 0.\nAs can be seen, the post-CPI bias has been for OTM puts expiring in 20 to 40 days. Meanwhile, as we move toward longer-dated options, the skew flips in favor of calls or bullish bets.\n“This indicates that investors are growing more optimistic about bitcoin’s longer-term prospects and are willing to pay more to be positioned for potential upside by buying OTM calls,” CF Benchmarks said.\nThe chart also shows relatively flat implied volatility levels for longer-dated options, a sign of increased institutional participation.\n“This could be interpreted as a sign of increasing institutional involvement, as these investors often have a more nuanced view of the market and are less prone to extreme sentiment swings,” CF Benchmarks added.\nA similar long-term bullish bias is seen in options trading on the cryptocurrency exchange Deribit, which accounts for over 85% of the global crypto options activity. As of writing, notional open interest or the dollar value of the number of open bitcoin options contracts on Deribit was $15.63 billion. Meanwhile, open interest in CME options was $417 million.\nAt the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at $65,550, representing a weekly gain of 6.6%, according to CoinDesk data.\n",

    "summary": "A dozen Democrats joined 48 Republicans in voting to repeal SAB 121.\n",
    "content": "The U.S. Senate joined the House of Representatives on Thursday in seeking to erase the controversial Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crypto policy known as Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, though President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the resolution. The Senate voted 60-38 on the effort to overturn the policy, commonly referred to as SAB 121, though the crypto industry may not breathe a sigh of relief over the initiative\u0027s banking constraints, because Biden said that letting the rule be removed this way would disrupt \"work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.\"\nA dozen Democrats voted alongside a majority of Republicans in favor of the resolution, easily giving it well over the simple majority of votes needed to pass. However, the resolution did not receive enough votes to make it veto-proof.\nEven Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) bucked the leader of his party in opposing the SEC\u0027s crypto effort, alongside other leaders in the Democratic Party.\nSen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who pushed for the resolution in the Senate, said the bulletin was \"a disaster\" that did not protect consumers.\n\"This is a win for financial innovation and a clear rebuke of the way the Biden administration and Chair Gary Gensler have treated crypto assets and marks the first time both chambers of Congress have passed standalone crypto legislation,\" she said in a statement.\nIssued by the agency in 2022, SAB 121 held that a company keeping a customer\u0027s cryptocurrencies should record them on its own balance sheet – which could have major capital implications for banks working with crypto clients. Republican lawmakers bashed the SEC for instituting a policy without going through the necessary rule process, and the Government Accountability Office agreed, finding that the regulator erred in how it handled what should have been a rule instead of staff guidance.\n\"SAB 121 is non-binding staff guidance that, if followed, enhances important disclosure to investors in firms that safeguard crypto assets for others,\" an SEC spokesperson said in a statement after the vote. \"Time and again, we have seen crypto firms fail and watched as their customers lined up at the bankruptcy court in hopes of getting what they thought was legally theirs.\"\nFor years, Republican lawmakers have fought with the federal financial agencies over the role of \"guidance\" documents, arguing that regulators stretch their authorities, and that the regulated industries feel they can\u0027t afford to ignore guidance, whether it\u0027s \"non-binding\" or not.\nRead More: House Resolution to Overturn Controversial SEC Rule Likely to Pass in Senate: Sources\nLawmakers in the House and Senate went after SAB 121 under the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to overturn federal rules. A number of Democrats – including 21 in the House – joined with the largely Republican effort, defying the White House\u0027s warnings.\nRep. Mike Flood (R-Neb.), one of the architects of the resolution, called the vote a \"landmark result,\" noting the bipartisan support.\n\"It is clear there is overwhelming opposition to SAB 121, and I urge President Joe Biden to reconsider his previous statement of intent to veto the resolution. The President should sign my resolution to ensure the SEC reverses course and sets America on a path to growing our digital financial future,\" he said. Because they sought to kill the policy with the Congressional Review Act, a successful reversal would – by law – mean the SEC wouldn\u0027t be able to pursue similar policies in the future, which the White House statement suggested \"could also inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto-assets including financial stability.\"\nRep. Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.), who also cosponsored the House resolution, said the House \"never should\u0027ve had to resort to\" the Congressional Review Act and reiterated his call to the SEC to withdraw the bulletin before it goes to Biden\u0027s desk.\n\"Today\u0027s Senate vote to repeal SAB 121 sends a clear bipartisan message: Congress will not stand idly by as Gary Gensler and the SEC deliberately sidestep the statutory rulemaking process and overstep their regulatory authority,\" he said.\nApart from a previous crypto taxation provision that made its way into an infrastructure law despite the industry\u0027s resistance, this marks the first time that Congress has moved on an issue that focuses on the crypto industry, and it was in a way meant to aid the sector.\nSEC spokespeople did not immediately return a request for comment.\nUPDATE (May 16, 2024, 17:20 UTC): Adds lawmaker statements.\nUPDATE (May 16, 2024, 18:21 UTC): Adds SEC comment.\nUPDATE (May 16, 2024, 23:40 UTC): Corrects Rep. Flood\u0027s name.\n",

    "summary": "\"Ether is a \u0027lightning rod\u0027 for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots,\" one observer said.\nThe ether-bitcoin ratio slides to a three-year low, extending year-to-date losses to nearly 16%.\nSeveral factors, such as uncertainty about the launch of spot ETH ETF in the U.S. and the growth of Ethereum-killers like Solana, are responsible for ether’s underperformance.\n",
    "content": "The ratio between ether (ETH) and bitcoin’s (BTC) dollar-denominated prices continues to slide, extending year-to-date losses as suggested by the bearish death cross pattern a month ago.\nETH/BTC slipped to 0.04563 on crypto exchange Binance soon before press time, reaching the lowest since April 2021, according to charting platform TradingView. This year, the ratio has declined nearly 16%, indicating a bias for bitcoin or the leading cryptocurrency by market value.\nThe slide to three-year lows follows reduced demand for exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to ether.\nAccording to Bloomberg data quoted by ETC Group in its weekly report, global ether ETPs registered net outflows of around $63.5 million last week, with Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) losing the most. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETPs raked in $92.5 million last week.\nSeveral factors, including competing layer 1s and lingering uncertainty about the debut of spot ETH approvals in the U.S, are likely responsible for ETH falling out of investor favor.\n“The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has reinforced bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative and its status as a macro asset. On the other hand, open questions about ETH’s fundamental positioning within the crypto sector remain. Competing layer-1s (L1s) like Solana detract from Ethereum’s positioning as the \u0027go-to\u0027 network for decentralized app (dApp) deployment,” Coinbase Institutional’s Research analyst David Han said in a note Wednesday.\nSolana’s share in total decentralized exchange volumes has grown tenfold from 2% to 21% in one year, eating into Ethereum\u0027s market share.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighted nearly a dozen spot BTC ETFs in January. Since then, these funds have drawn roughly $12 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors.\nApproval of spot ETFs tied to ether will open a similar pool of capital for Ethereum’s native token, although it’s unclear when the SEC will approve it.\nTraders on decentralized betting platform Polymarket see just a 10% chance of the SEC approving a spot ETF on or before May 31. The regulator has until May 23 to decide whether to approve or reject VanEck’s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF. The deadline for BlackRock’s application is June 23.\nAccording to finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, the SEC is looking for reasons to deny ETH ETF applications by BlackRock and others on grounds that they have been improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they hold a security.\nIlan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said ether is a \"lightning rod\" for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots.\n“Capital gets fragmented. There are proportionally greater numbers of ways to get exposure to the ecosystem through the many Layer 2s tokens (OP, ARB…) and native protocol tokens in each one. The capital gets fragmented,\" Solot said in an email.\nSolot added that strong anti-ETH sentiment from [rival] Solana community and Bitcoin propounders is driving negative ether narratives and the high beta cryptocurrency is a \"perfect vehicle\" for external players to express bearish view given it trades on traditional exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\nLastly, Ether recently turned inflationary, reversing the bullish deflationary supply trend seen consistently since its parent network Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus ecosystem in September 2022.\n",

    "content": "I must admit to choking on my tequila drink a couple weeks ago after hearing the phrase \"investable asset class\" applied to the category of digital tokens known as meme coins. But for many investors and projects, the opportunity is being taken quite seriously. See our riff below.\nALSO:\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.\nMEME RUSH! An industry source told me over margaritas a few weeks ago, \"You\u0027re starting to hear venture capital firms make the argument that meme coins are becoming an investable asset class.\" What\u0027s undeniable is that meme coins are popping, and there does appear to be a thriving industry in promoting them. In April alone, CoinMarketCap added 138 meme coins to its listings, versus 18 in the same month a year earlier, bringing the total to 2,229, with a market capitalization of more than $50 billion, as reported by our Omkar Godbole. Last week, VanEck, a crypto-friendly institutional investment firm, started a new Meme Coin Index, tracking prices of doggy-themed tokens dogecoin (DOGE) and dogwifhat (WIF) as well as other ridiculousness like BONK. Another dog token, FLOKI, shared the title sponsorship for a cricket series between Pakistan and Ireland. Crypto analysts are talking up the election-related meme coins TRUMP and BODEN, and tokens associated with the X-Men character Wolverine flooded several blockchains after TheRoaringKitty, the personality behind the GameStop meme stock frenzy, posted a related video on X. Even independent Bitcoin programmer Jimmy Song, often a vocal critic of non-Bitcoin token creation, wrote in a Substack post that he appreciated the \"honesty\" of the movement: \"Meme coins obsoleted the VCs and ultimately brought some more honesty to the Nietzschean will-to-power games that were always being played.\" Speaking of Bitcoin, the OG blockchain now has meme coins too, many of them created with the Runes protocol launched last month. Sovryn, a decentralized trading platform with Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and secured by Bitcoin through merge-mining on the Rootstock sidechain, announced Wednesday that it has created a fully-premined rune called POWA, airdropped the tokens to users and established pools for trading them. \"Runes provide a way for projects to create and distribute tokens natively on the Bitcoin blockchain for memes,\" Sovryn said in a press release.\nSTAKERS NOW RESTAKERS? Our Sam Kessler has the scoop: \"The co-founders of Lido, the biggest liquid staking protocol on Ethereum, are secretly funding a competitor to EigenLayer, the buzzy \"restaking\" service that has emerged rapidly this year to become a powerful force in decentralized finance. According to several people with knowledge of the matter, the project is called Symbiotic and has drawn backing from not only the Lido co-founders, Konstantin Lomashuk and Vasiliy Shapovalov, through their venture firm Cyber Fund, but also Paradigm, the crypto venture capital firm that is one of Lido\u0027s lead investors. CoinDesk also obtained internal Symbiotic documents that describe the project, which allows users to \"restake\" using Lido\u0027s staked ether (stETH) token and other popular assets that are not natively compatible with EigenLayer.\"\nJUST IN: Two brothers have been arrested by the U.S. Department of Justice for attacking the Ethereum blockchain and stealing $25 million of cryptocurrency during a 12-second exploit, according to an indictment unsealed on Wednesday.\nTHE WORDS OF VITALIK. We\u0027ve written quite a bit in The Protocol newsletter about just how prolific (and prolix) the Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin can be as a writer. It\u0027s also true that when he writes, people tend to write a lot about whatever he writes – such as this opus on \"multidimensional gas pricing,\" which Decrypt covered. But apparently Buterin is also crazy fast as a scribbler, especially when it comes to banging out Ethereum improvement proposals on deadline, as chronicled on Tuesday by our Margaux Nijkerk. With time ticking down toward an important meeting to discuss new Ethereum wallet standards, it took Buterin just 22 minutes to draft EIP-7702, offered as a substitute for an earlier proposal, EIP-3074, that had drawn complaints from some developers. The hot-off-the-press publication drew plaudits from critics, with much of the Ethereum community quickly coming around in support of replacing the earlier effort with Buterin\u0027s proposed solution.\nThe courtroom where Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was sentenced. (Camomile Shumba/CoinDesk)\nAlexey Pertsev, 31, a developer of the coin mixer Tornado Cash, has been found guilty of money laundering by a Dutch judge, and was given 64 months of prison time. The case, along with other recent actions brought by prosecutors around the world, has raised questions about the extent of responsibility that developers might bear for any code they write. As reported by our Camomile Shumba, prosecutors in the Dutch case made the argument that Pertsev \"should have at least suspected the criminal origins of illicit transactions on the Tornado Cash platform.\"\nSolana-based crypto trading protocol Cypher has endured its share of hacks and heists. But its latest loss was an inside job. On Tuesday, a pseudonymous developer known as Hoak admitted to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies from Cypher\u0027s hack reimbursement fund. \"I took the funds and gambled them away,\" Hoak said in a statement, blaming his activity on a \"crippling gambling addiction.\"\nEl Salvador set up a new website to track its $350 million bitcoin stockpile, Bitcoin Magazine reported.\nDegen Chain, an Ethereum layer-3 blockchain dedicated to meme coins, came back online after a two-day outage. (Launched in March, Degen Chain is an \"an ultra-low-cost L3 for the Degen community built with Arbitrum Orbit, Base for settlement, and AnyTrust for data availability,\" according to a blog post at the time by Syndicate, the blockchain\u0027s infrastructure partner.)\nICYMI: CoinDesk\u0027s Danny Nelson takes a look inside the shadowy world of crypto influencers known as \"key opinion leaders,\" or KOLs, who invest in the projects they promote on social media – in return for the privilege of selling out before other investors.\nTop picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.\nHyperbolic\u0027s Proof of Sampling architecture (Zhang et al)\n1. Hyperbolic, the two-year-old startup that math olympian Jasper Zhang leads focused on decentralized AI computing, said Thursday that it is introducing a protocol called “Proof of Sampling (PoSP),” aimed at addressing challenges with trust in decentralized AI networks. Hyperbolic was co-founded in 2022 by Zhang and Yuchen Jin, who holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Washington.\n2. Lens Lab, a part of the Stani Kulechov-led Avara and the team behind Lens Protocol, a Web3 social platform built on Polygon PoS, announced that it is now developing its own blockchain network, Lens Network. The new network will be built on Matter Labs\u0027 ZK Stack, powered by zkSync on Ethereum. \"The Lens Network will set a new baseline/precedent for how social networks should be built,\" Alex Gluchowski, co-founder and CEO of Matter Labs, said in a press release.\n3. Polkadot, the layer-1 chain ecosystem co-founded by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, has debuted Asynchronous Backing, according to the team: It sets the stage for Polkadot 2.0, \"a wave of enhancements expected to significantly improve the scalability, cost, speed and flexibility of the network, and accelerate growth of decentralized applications,\" according to the team. \"Asynchronous Backing cuts block time in half (from 12 to 6 seconds) enables parallel transaction validation block production, and delivers up to 10x higher throughput for Polkadot\u0027s parachain consensus protocol.\"\n4. Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX has expanded what started as the Okto wallet into an Okto ecosystem, which will include launching a blockchain, a token, and a points program starting Tuesday. The aim is to give global users a single-click mobile experience while traversing the Web3 space, its co-founders Neeraj Khandelwal and Sumit Gupta told CoinDesk in an interview.\n5. Cyber, the just-unveiled rebranding for the developer formerly known as CyberConnect, has launched its own layer-2 network in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, describing it as the \"first L2 for social.\" According to the team, the new chain relies on \"top modular solutions. Cyber integrates Optimism’s OP Stack, EigenDA and custom features to provide low fees, high TPS and a user-friendly experience.\" According to a blog post: \"AltLayer will manage the rollup’s technical launch, ongoing management, operations and future upgrades.\"\nEasyA Consensus Hackathon - Call for Participants\nThis year, Consensus is hosting its first ever in-person hackathon together with the world\u0027s number 1 Web3 learning app, EasyA.

Another goal is to make sure insiders and early backers keep skin in the game, an assurance of good faith, as it were.\nNow comes a new feature from Colony Lab, a developer and project incubator in the Avalanche blockchain ecosystem, called \"liquid vesting.\"\nIf it sounds like a workaround, that\u0027s because it basically is. Have your bags and keep them too. Take liquidity now, without having to wait for the end of the vesting period.\nClick here for the full article by CoinDesk\u0027s Margaux Nijkerk\nFundraisings\nData and Tokens\nWe covered last month\u0027s launch of the Runes protocol atop Bitcoin, observing in real time as its instant popularity and uptake right after the bitcoin halving sent transaction fees to record levels, as users scrambled to mint new meme coins, competing to get transactions included in the suddenly-congested blockchain. (As a plug: I\u0027m scheduled to interview Rodarmor onstage on May 31 at CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus conference in Austin.) Even as recently as last week, Runes accounted for a majority of all transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, outpacing the original bitcoin as well as Ordinals inscriptions and the rival fungible-token standard BRC-20.\nBut the Runes frenzy has now faded somewhat. Runes has been \"written off as a flop, with waning interest failing to match the hype,\" according to a report by the blockchain analysis firm Coin Metrics. The analysts noted, however, that there may still be hope for a resurgence: \"Runes are yet to be validated in the form of listings on major exchanges, trading largely on niche collectibles platforms.\" Transactions related to the new protocol appear to be ticking down:\nRunes transactions of all types have shrunk since the launch around April 20.

    "summary": "Ryan Selkis built a political fundraising machine for crypto that\u0027s ready to sway elections in 2024. That\u0027s why the Messari founder is one of CoinDesk\u0027s Most Influential people of 2023.\n",
    "content": "In public, Ryan Selkis is one of crypto\u0027s loudest gadflies, regularly excoriating U.S. regulators for overreach, especially Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, in social media tirades.\nBehind the scenes, the founder and CEO of data and analytics provider Messari has spent the last two years building a political fundraising machine for the industry that\u0027s gearing up to sway elections in 2024.\nThis profile is part of CoinDesk\u0027s Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here. Selkis is a speaker at CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus 2024 festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.\nSelkis recently handed off this work to Fairshake, a political action committee (PAC). It wields a war chest of about $15 million, a person close to the situation said. (Numbers won\u0027t be disclosed in federal filings until January.) Brian Armstrong, CEO of leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said in October he personally gave Fairshake $1 million and hoped the PAC could raise $50 million or more.\nFairshake has begun putting those funds to work; Politico reported in November that the PAC spent $1.2 million in recent months on television ads for House candidates.\nFor laying the groundwork for this political blitz, CoinDesk has named Selkis one of the 10 Most Influential people in crypto for 2023.\nTime will tell how well the PAC achieves its goals of filling open House and Senate seats with pro-crypto candidates, re-electing crypto-friendly incumbents and unseating hostile ones. But in Selkis\u0027 view, his combative public style has already been vindicated.\n\"In 2021, it seemed like I was crazy,\" Selkis said in an interview in early November. \"Now it\u0027s common sentiment across the industry that [Gensler is] really not a good actor operating in good faith by any stretch.\"\nIt has indeed been a humbling year for Gensler, whose SEC suffered setbacks in its court battles with crypto companies such as Ripple and Grayscale. Gensler has also come under scrutiny for cozy interactions with Sam Bankman-Fried during the heyday of FTX, years before that crypto exchange collapsed and its CEO was convicted on federal fraud charges.\nIt is also true that in 2021, Selkis did seem a little crazy – or, at least, hotheaded and impolitic.\nIn September of that year, near the height of the last bull market, Selkis posted on Twitter (now known as X) that he had decided to run for Senate and declared \"war on our out-of-control regulatory state.\"\nThe proximate trigger for his salvo was a subpoena the SEC had served the day before to a crypto executive about to walk onstage at Messari\u0027s annual Mainnet conference in New York. (The subpoenaed party was later identified as Do Kwon, founder of the TerraUSD stablecoin that collapsed the following year, whom the SEC eventually charged with fraud, and who is now languishing in a Montenegrin prison while the U.S. and South Korea fight for his extradition.)\n\"If you\u0027re wondering when I actually decided to run for Senate, it was when these f--kers came to my event, didn\u0027t buy a ticket, and served one of the speakers a subpoena,\" Selkis tweeted. \"Enough talk. … Selkis 2024. Time to activate the crypto political machine.\"\nThat evening, I received an anxious text from a crypto industry lawyer.\n\"Selkis is really doing damage,\" this attorney, who had previously worked in the more genteel field of banking, told me. \"He has been antagonizing Gensler … He is out of control, fanning fires unnecessarily.\"\nTo Selkis, however, policymakers like Gensler and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) never needed antagonizing; they had it in for crypto from the get-go.\n\"This year, we\u0027ve seen just how one-sided the narrative is, and how punitive some policymakers are,\" Selkis told me in November. \"It\u0027s not tinfoil-hat anymore to think that \u0027they\u0027re out to get us\u0027 when someone like Elizabeth Warren is literally putting out campaign ads that say she\u0027s raising money and building an anti-crypto army.\"\nThe November 2022 collapse of FTX did the industry no favors in the public eye or in Washington, D.C. But Selkis argues last year\u0027s crypto crash is not the only reason for a slew of aggressive enforcement actions from the SEC and antagonistic legislation like Warren\u0027s bill, which would extend customer-identification requirements to miners and wallet providers.\n\"The opposition to crypto is more than just a reaction or overreaction to some of the fraud and bankruptcies from last year,\" he said. \"It\u0027s much more philosophical. Crypto is just one issue that that radical anti-tech philosophy is going to impact.\"\nSelkis never ran for Senate (he told me he seriously considered it but had no shot in any of the states he could credibly run in). He still saw a need for a more muscular crypto presence in Washington than the handful of trade associations and think tanks that have represented the industry for the last decade or so.\n\"They\u0027d have productive meetings with policymakers, and then that policymaker would more likely than not look at their watch and say, \u0027Oh, this has been a great conversation, but I gotta jet early so that I can go to a fundraiser with the bankers\u0027 association,\u0027\" Selkis said. \"And that\u0027s just kind of the reality of how D.C. operates.\"\nMost crypto executives, he said, were naive in underestimating the importance of political donations and vehicles like PACs. With one unfortunate exception.\nSam Bankman-Fried was a prolific political donor, showering politicians with tens of millions in campaign contributions before his FTX empire imploded in November 2022. During his heyday, he was often cast as a long-needed diplomat who, disheveled appearance notwithstanding, could hold constructive dialogue with Washington, unlike the anarchists and techbros long associated with crypto.\n\"The media and D.C. establishment – not the industry by any stretch – basically anointed him as our representative and it blew up in our face,\" Selkis said.\nNow facing decades in prison for misusing FTX customers\u0027 funds, the former golden boy has become crypto\u0027s greatest embarrassment, a title for which there is no shortage of competition.\nFor Selkis, the irony is delicious, particularly because Bankman-Fried had been aggressively lobbying for a bill that detractors said would have killed decentralized finance (DeFi) in the U.S. and entrenched centralized platforms like FTX.\n\"Some of the very worst folks that we\u0027ve had to deal with as an industry and some of the folks that have since been sued for fraud, or have now been convicted in Sam\u0027s case … they were seen as the \u0027adults\u0027 and it was because, of course, they didn\u0027t fight,\" Selkis said.\n\"They were trying to basically capture these folks in D.C. that would ultimately give them a pass or a monopoly,\" he went on. \"By currying favor and kissing ass, they were willing to sell basically anyone out, including their customers, in some cases. But they always said the nice things.\"\nReferring to the role-playing game Dungeons \u0026 Dragons, Selkis said he\u0027d rather be \"the chaotic good than the lawful evil.\"\nTweets aside, Selkis\u0027 big splash as an aspiring political kingmaker was appearing on Fox News\u0027 Tucker Carlson Tonight in February 2022. Appealing to the populist sensibilities of the host and audience, Selkis cast crypto as a check on Big Government, Big Banks and Big Tech, and contrasted decentralized systems like Bitcoin with the centralized digital currency created by the Chinese Communist Party.\nHe concluded by telling Carlson he had founded the Digital Freedom Alliance (DFA) to advance pro-crypto policies – and more importantly, to support pro-crypto candidates.\n\"This is going to be a swing voter\u0027s issue, with 50 million Americans owning crypto, and quite a bit of single-issue voters, myself included, among that cohort,\" Selkis predicted. \"It\u0027s a nonpartisan issue too, Tucker,\" he added, just before the segment ended.\n(The 50 million figure, which implies one in five U.S. adults own crypto, later appeared in a survey commissioned by Coinbase. Better Markets, an advocacy group, questioned the findings, noting that the 2,202 respondents included an oversample, or deliberate addition, of 500 crypto investors.)\nWhen I spoke to Selkis in November, I asked if there were really enough single-issue crypto voters to make a difference – particularly now, after a brutal bear market. Even if there are 50 million American crypto holders, surely a nontrivial portion of them are underwater on their investments or have been burned by bankrupt exchanges and lenders.\nHe said the truly significant cohort was a subset of those with portfolios. \"Maybe at best, it\u0027s a wash, whether the number of people that own crypto helps or hurts us,\" Selkis acknowledged. \"But when you think about the folks who really have made [crypto] either their livelihood or just philosophically feel very strongly [in favor of it],\" there are enough to tip the balance in key races.\n\"Certain states are only won or lost by tens of thousands of votes,\" he said. \"So you don\u0027t need to have 50 million people become single-issue voters. You only need a couple hundred thousand in the right areas.\"\nSelkis stressed to me he favors \"common-sense regulation\" and comprehensive bipartisan legislation that would promote healthy competition while protecting investors. Pretending crypto will never be regulated is \"childish,\" he said.\nThe lack of clear guardrails encouraged risk-taking in the last crypto bubble, Selkis argued. For example, the SEC\u0027s reluctance to approve an exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by bitcoin forced investors simply looking for BTC exposure to buy coins on offshore exchanges like FTX and Binance, he said.\nBy April 2023, Selkis was setting audacious goals for the DFA, tweeting that he would raise $100 million. An article in Barron\u0027s noted this would have been more than the powerful National Association of Realtors spent lobbying Congress in 2022.\nIn October, when he appeared with Coinbase\u0027s Armstrong at Mainnet 2023, Selkis sounded humbler in his ambitions, saying crypto first needed to catch up with established industries in political spending.\n\"These super PACs in other industries can raise $50 million, $100 million,\" he said. \"I mean, we\u0027re getting outspent by like the f**king pipe welders of Ohio right now.\" (Not as hyperbolic as it sounds: Building trade union PACs as a group gave $13.5 million to candidates during the 2022 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets.)\nSelkis declared from the outset of his campaign that he didn\u0027t want to go into politics full-time. Building Messari, the data and analytics company he started in 2018 with head of engineering Diran Li and chief revenue officer Eric Turner, would always be the first priority. A funding round last fall valued the firm at $300 million.\nBy the time he spoke at Mainnet in October, Selkis had handed over most fundraising work to Michael Carcaise, a political operative whose GMI PAC spent about $12 million in the 2022 election cycle supporting pro-tech candidates in general and has begun to support pro-crypto candidates through Fairshake.\n\"Mike and his team did a great job picking the districts, picking the seats, last time around, that they were going to go after and try to support candidates on an early basis,\" Selkis told Armstrong. Of the 23 candidates indirectly backed by Carcaise\u0027s GMI (through his Web3 Forward and Crypto Innovation PACs) last year, 19 won general elections and three lost primaries, according to public data compiled by OpenSecrets. (One more fell just short of winning a primary with 49% of the vote, then dropped out of the runoff after an infidelity scandal.)\nAlthough he\u0027s handed Carcaise the reins, don\u0027t expect Selkis to hold his tongue on policy matters. Another reason he is so outspoken, he said, is that as an information provider, Messari has less to lose than a regulated financial services company living in fear of enforcement actions.\n\"I can say things others can\u0027t,\" Selkis said.\n",

    "summary": "By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers, Montclair State University adjunct professor Burak Tamac writes.\n",
    "content": "As bitcoin (BTC) continues to gain traction worldwide, the approach to introducing it to newcomers plays a crucial role in its widespread adoption. While some advocates firmly believe in a \"Bitcoin only\" narrative, this aggressive stance can often hinder the conversation and deter potential adopters.\nInstead, a \"Bitcoin first\" approach, which prioritizes education and understanding, may prove more effective in fostering genuine interest and long-term investment in bitcoin.\nBurak Tamac is an adjunct professor at Montclair State University, teaching politics and technology.\nThis essay is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.\nProponents of the \"Bitcoin only\" narrative often argue passionately for the superiority of bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies. However, this approach can come across as confrontational and off-putting to those who are new to the concept. When people feel attacked or told that their current investments are wrong, they are more likely to disengage from the conversation entirely. This is particularly true in countries like Turkey, where many individuals are already familiar with alternative investments like altcoins.\nTo effectively promote bitcoin adoption, the focus should shift from telling people what to do to providing them with the knowledge to make informed decisions. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in understanding the broader cryptocurrency landscape, educators can help people grasp the unique features and advantages of bitcoin without disparaging other investments outright.\nWhen individuals learn about the Bitcoin network\u0027s decentralized nature, its limited supply and its potential as a store of value, they can better appreciate its significance. This foundation of knowledge allows them to evaluate other cryptocurrencies more critically and recognize the authenticity of bitcoin\u0027s value proposition.\nSee also: Allen Farrington: Capital in the 21st Century | Opinion\nEncouraging people to blindly invest in bitcoin without proper understanding is a short-sighted approach. When individuals buy bitcoin solely based on hype or fear of missing out, they are more likely to panic sell during market fluctuations. This behavior not only harms their personal financial well-being but also discourages them to learn more about bitcoin.\nIn contrast, when people invest in bitcoin after learning about its fundamentals and long-term potential, they are more likely to hold their investments through market cycles. This informed decision-making promotes stability and helps to build a stronger, more resilient Bitcoin community.\nTo accelerate bitcoin adoption, I believe advocates should prioritize education to start a conversation; and the education should not start about what they do wrong, but what they can do more. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy and technological understanding, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers.\nBy adopting a \"Bitcoin first\" approach that prioritizes education and understanding, we can create a more welcoming and empowering environment for newcomers. This shift in narrative, from \"Bitcoin only\" to \"Bitcoin first,\" has the potential to accelerate adoption.\n",

    "summary": "The so-called FIT21 legislation to establish a U.S. regulatory regime for digital assets is set for a floor vote next week, and the sector is telling House leaders the effort is \"crucial.\"\nA wide swath of the crypto industry signed a letter to the top lawmakers in the U.S. House of Represenatives, explaining why they should get behind the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.\nAs House lawmakers are poised for a floor vote next week on the bill, the letter says passage would help the U.S. keep up with global competitors.\n",
    "content": "The U.S. House of Representatives is on the verge of a vote that will represent the closest the cryptocurrency industry has ever been toward finally winning regulation in the U.S., and the sector\u0027s associations and top businesses are encouraging House leaders to support the effort.\nThrough the Crypto Council for Innovation, a coalition of digital assets organizations and companies, including Coinbase, Kraken, Andreessen Horowitz, the Digital Currency Group and about 50 others, wrote a letter to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), advocating for passage of the bill. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) has been authorized for floor time next week, where observers are hoping to see a mid-week vote.\nThe bill would set the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a leading regulator of digital assets, and it sets out clear divisions for what the CFTC will handle and what would fall under the reach of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It would establish consumer protections – including rules around custody of customers\u0027 assets and their treatment in bankruptcy – and set up further guardrails against risky behavior.\n\"By passing this legislation, we can accelerate the growth of blockchain technology and digital assets, fostering financial inclusion and protecting national security,\" according to the letter. \"It is crucial for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in financial innovation.\"\nThe crypto industry is on a high in Washington at the moment, having watched both the House and Senate easily pass a resolution overturning a crypto accounting policy from the SEC, though President Joe Biden vowed to veto the effort. That move to erase the SEC\u0027s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) represented a fight that went decidedly in the industry\u0027s favor, drawing many supporters from the Democratic Party that\u0027s been more reticent than Republicans in backing crypto.\nFor that accounting tussle, more than one in five Senate Democrats voted on the industry\u0027s side, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and it was about one in 10 Democrats in the House.\nBut the comprehensive legislation now approaching a House vote is of a much higher magnitude, and key Senate Democrats have so far seemed unprepared to match the House\u0027s effort. To date, the Senate has only shown a potential willingness to fit a different crypto bill – one regulating stablecoin issuers – into a package deal with other financial legislation.\nRep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee where the bill was launched, said the level of Democratic support for FIT21 in the House could be a major factor in whether the Senate is moved to action. When the measure cleared his committee, it did so with a handful of Democrats on board, despite opposition from their senior member, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.)\nOn its way toward the floor, the FIT21 effort drew a range of amendments called for by the House Rules Committee to meet a May 16 deadline.\n",

    "content": "Institutional demand and rising appetite for risk assets could cause bitcoin to breach all-time highs of $74,000 as early as next week, some traders say.\n“Bitcoin was pulling back towards $65K on Thursday but is already trying to regain its footing above $66K on Friday morning. If cryptocurrencies get support from the global risk appetite on Friday, Bitcoin could exceed $70K over the weekend,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in a note to CoinDesk, referring to increased inflows from spot ETFs.\n“A test of the $71K-$74K highs area, in our view, could happen as early as early next week, triggering a new episode of FOMO,” Kuptsikevich.\nSingapore-based QCP Capital gave out similar price targets in a client note earlier this week.\nSuch bullish outlooks come as U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the asset have logged four straight days of inflows, ending Thursday at $257 million in net inflows. This is a nearly 180-degree turn from the action of the past few weeks – with some of the biggest ETFs seeing zero inflows on some days.\nBlackRock’s IBIT received $94 million in inflows on Thursday, the largest among peers. GrayScale’s GBTC, which has mostly seen outflows since its January listing, received over $4.6 million in inflows.\nEarlier this week, multiple regulatory filings showed that several big-name funds, such as Millennium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios.\nThe softer-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggered a break out of the range for BTC on Wednesday. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March.\n",

    "summary": "The Gauntlet founder talks about the state of crypto ahead of Consensus 2024.\n",
    "content": "Crypto is a world built for autodidacts, a playground for polymaths. Tarun Chitra, the founder of the risk management, economic research and software optimization organization Gauntlet, is just one shining example. In a conversation with Chitra, this comes through. It seems there is no corner of crypto he hasn’t examined.\nChitra, who often takes his time to pause before answering questions, will be speaking at Consensus 2024, May 29-31, in Austin, Texas.\nCoinDesk caught up with the bona fide DeFi celebrity known for his colorful style (hair, glasses and clothes) to talk about new financial primitives in crypto, artificial wombs and why he appreciates hecklers.\nThis interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.\nI thought maybe we could start off with a quick round of overrated/underrated. You could skip any of them or clarify your statements if you prefer.\nSure.\nLife extension?\nI have a very rough classification in my head of, like, passive versus active life extension. Passive is: I become healthier by eating better and maybe I take some supplements. Active is: I get all sorts of esoteric experimental therapies and, like, injections. You know what I mean, one involves surgeries and the other a simpler change in habits.\nI was thinking more of the former.\nProbably overrated. I think the latter is rated correctly.\nYeah. Healthy living is good.\nBut that\u0027s why I wanted to separate those.\nArtificial wombs?\nI actually think fairly rated. Maybe slightly underrated, actually. But not super underrated. I feel like they\u0027re getting a lot of hype.\nCLOBs [central limit order book exchanges].\nOverrated.\nCould you say why?\nI think we had the era of CLOBs as the only thing that worked. Then AMMs took off and CLOBs were like crap. And then in the perpetuals and low-latency blockchain worlds everyone was like “CLOBs are better, CLOBs are better.” Not that we have seen a lot of people necessarily going back to CLOBs, but I feel like the tide has shifted right now. People are constantly sh*ting on AMMs. So that\u0027s fine. But it feels like there\u0027s always this cyclic thing between the two.\nSee also: What Is an Automated Market Maker?\nDutch auctions?\nOne shot Dutch auctions are overrated. Multi-shot Dutch auctions are underrated.\nOmnichains?\nCan you define what you mean by omnichain for this context?\nHonestly, not so much. It\u0027s just a term that I’ve seen pop up a lot recently, and I can’t tell what they are.\nYeah, well, I have found it to be more of a marketing term than anything real, to be totally honest. So overrated, it feels like it\u0027s not a real thing. It doesn\u0027t refer to a single technical thing that I could write down equations for and tell you like, “this is a guarantee you\u0027re getting from this.”\nThat was the impression that I got as well. This is maybe a mean one, but Aave.\nDecline to answer.\nWho are your intellectual heroes?\nPaul Dirac. John von Neumann. I’m trying to think of a more recent one. The boring one is like the Terence Taos of the world. Is there someone who\u0027s not as famous? … Yeah, stick with those. Those are those well known enough, I feel like the other ones are way too niche.\nFair enough. You wrote about DAO governance in 2021. I was wondering if you think we\u0027ve learned anything since then? if DAO governance has at all improved in the intervening years?\nI think there\u0027s kind of this thing where the actual governance processes for a lot of DAO either worsened or improved. Either due to sclerosis or due to centralized takeover or whatever, there\u0027s lots of reasons for one or the other. I don\u0027t think there have been many new mechanisms that people have focused on because you don\u0027t get rewarded for improving a DAO mechanism.\nSee also: DAOs Beware: Neo-Imperialism Is on the Rise\nWith Compound, I feel like because of the way they launched, they actually got rewarded as a team for improving DAO mechanisms when they decentralized governance in 2020. But since then everyone who has innovated on governance has been generally outside of DeFi. And those haven\u0027t made it.\nThere\u0027s still a lot of mechanistic innovation that hasn\u0027t been done. And part of the reason that hasn\u0027t been done is it\u0027s underfunded relative to other things, right? Like you can raise much more money for making another robot than you could ever raise for a new governance system.\nWhen is it appropriate for crypto to embrace financial nihilism? As in, lean into it?\nGood question. Feels like we are currently leaning in. So I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s an answer to when it is appropriate – but hasn\u0027t it already happened? The problem for me is that financial nihilism is a real consumer application. Most other things considered crypto for consumers, people are like, it’s a scam, or a lie, or it doesn’t really need crypto at all it’d work fine as Web2 to me – I can go down the list.\nFinancial nihilism is a real consumer product. Like there\u0027s no there\u0027s no way around it. It\u0027s hard to get around the fact that they\u0027ve found a way to make Binance more fun to someone who doesn\u0027t like looking at candles – and I think that\u0027s why Pump.fun exists. People love it because it\u0027s the same thing but it doesn\u0027t feel like it and that\u0027s a good consumer application.\nThis will disappoint all the people who raise millions of dollars to do consumer crypto, but it\u0027s just what it is.\nDo you think Farcaster will ever fully supplant Crypto Twitter and would it be a loss to Farcaster if CT was recreated in full on Farcaster?\nFarcaster is like where the refugees of the WAGMI [we are all gonna make it] movement of 2021 went. It was all people who really were genuine in the beginning about being part of the cult of toxic positivity. I feel like the ones who were earnest about it went and made Farcaster. I just don\u0027t feel the trader-type people are ever going to perfectly intermesh, so it doesn\u0027t seem possible to fully re-create the “degen side.” Farcaster is so much more wholesome.\nDo you see any interesting financial primitives emerging that you think will become more and more important?\nI mean, in general, I think re-staking comes under that. But things that let you not know what network you\u0027re on, but give you the same security guarantees of that network; re-staking is one version of that, aggregation stuff that people are doing and ZK-land is one version of that. I think that\u0027s the key to making the UX of the multi-chain world feel anywhere near as good as something like Solana.\nThere are concerns that there\u0027s already too much ETH staked or will soon be too much ETH staked. Do you buy into that argument? Is there an appropriate amount?\nThat honestly depends. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a static, fixed quantity that will always forever be the right amount. It depends on usage. If it turns out there\u0027s a lot of usage of ETH in applications on-chain or in centralized exchanges, then it\u0027s kind of bad to have a lot of ETH staked because then there\u0027s no liquidity and you could run into a supply crunch.\nOn the other hand, if there is too little ETH staked, then yeah, of course, different types of attacks are possible. The biggest problem in some ways with proof-of-stake is that it’s easy to calculate the dollar-value of an attack. I can always just take 1/3 times the amount staked and figure out how expensive it is to attack.\nSee also: The Investor\u0027s Definitive Guide to Proof-of-Work\nWith proof-of-work, because people can join and leave, it takes a while to figure out how expensive an attack is and you can\u0027t figure it out quite as precisely. So the lower bound for proof-of-work is actually harder to estimate, and it’s actually harder to attack in some ways.\nSo I think it\u0027s always gonna be dynamic. Some new technologies will help reduce how much you have to have staked – that\u0027s the point of ZK and advanced cryptography, but it will never be constant. It really just depends on how much applications want to use, and if applications are using ether a lot.\nHow many pairs of glasses do you own?\nProbably like 10.\nAnd lastly, is there anything in particular that you\u0027re looking forward to at Consensus?\nDoing another live podcast.\nI was there last time. It was good!\nYeah, the live podcasts are fun. Especially if you get like an audience heckler.\nI’ll try to think of something clever to heckle.\nYeah well, thanks for stopping by.\n",

The token remains 80% below a lifetime peak of $3,700 set in December 2017.\nBitcoin Cash’s block reward is now 3.125 BCH. Halving occurs when the reward for mining transactions is cut by 50%, reducing the rate at which new coins are created and thus lowering the available new supply.\nBitcoin’s own halving is expected on April 20, trackers show, and has historically preceded a bull market for the token.

    "type": "Phemex",
    "summary": "The leading exchange continues to innovate in response to user needs. Its lending protocol offers a one-stop solution for all borrowing and lending requirements, while the upcoming upgrade to the SocialFi tool Pulse is designed to reward high-quality engagement.\nIncrease capital and leverage through asset-backed loans,\nEnjoy competitive rates and\nExperience seamless fund mobility.\n",
    "content": "Phemex, a top-tier cryptocurrency exchange, continues its streak of CeFi and DeFi innovations. Transitioning from a purely centralized platform, Phemex embraced decentralization last year and has evolved into a hybrid exchange, merging the best features of CEXes and DEXes. The latest fruit of this evolution is the Phemex Lending Protocol, which allows users to borrow cryptocurrency against their digital assets with favorable rates and ultimate flexibility, signaling Phemex\u0027s commitment to innovative, user-empowering solutions.\nWhile crypto enthusiasts have long expected that feature from their exchanges, Phemex revealed earlier this week some new advantages that can’t be found anywhere else.\nIf you think about it, there are three main reasons why you might want to use any crypto exchange’s lending services:\nBy each of these measures, the Phemex Lending Protocol meets or exceeds industry standards. Participants can take out loans denominated in USDT, BTC or ETH without the need to sell their crypto assets. Loans can also be taken out in PT, Phemex’s high-potential native coin.\nBecause all loans are securely collateralized by participants’ assets, Phemex can provide flexibility to choose loan terms with variable interest rates. Whatever the time horizon on the loan, crypto exchanges can generally offer better rates than brick-and-mortar banks, according to Forbes Advisor.\nEven so, the Phemex team is confident that their loans compare favorably even among crypto exchanges. Phemex highlights its competitive edge with an annual USDT borrowing interest rate starting at 3.57%, a figure notably lower than the double-digit rates prevalent on competing platforms – not to mention almost two percentage points lower than money-center banks lend to each other overnight. For holders of vePT – the wrapped PT version that will soon confer voting authority in Phemex’s governing DAO – the deal gets even sweeter with an additional 30% discount on borrowing rates.\nOf course, Phemex community members can withdraw and reallocate funds as they see fit, unfettered by undue limitations or delays. This means that Phemex traders can enjoy more lucrative capital efficiency than they can on other exchanges, aligning with the cryptosphere’s goal of unlocking the potential of money.\nAt Token2049 in Dubai last week, Phemex made a significant splash by hosting an elite gathering of major crypto community players and key opinion leaders. The extensive two-day networking event featured an insightful keynote by Phemex CEO Federico Variola. Another highlight of Token2049 was the introduction of the Phemex Lending Protocol, when Phemex COO Stella Chan showcased its competitive borrowing rates and the opportunity for users to supply assets in return for substantial earnings. In the future, the platform is expected to add uncollateralized loan capabilities which would propel its services beyond that of most DeFi lending protocols.\n“Phemex Lending Protocol is changing the game with low borrowing rates and a clear loan-to-value ratio, without any hidden fees,\" Chan announced. \"With $22 million in liquidity to start, users can now secure loans leveraging their holdings at just 3.57% APY – far below the high rates of other platforms. Our protocol ensures that users keep control, allowing them to freely withdraw and manage their funds. Additionally, by contributing to our lending pools, they can earn competitive APY returns, creating a robust passive income stream. It\u0027s a complete solution for favorable borrowing and earning.”\nBy integrating these lending features, Phemex is not only expanding its services but also reinforcing its commitment to fostering a more inclusive and accessible financial environment for all its users.\nCertainly, Phemex has a grander vision than just providing lower interest rates on collateralized loans. The team there has been all about innovation. All this leads into its Web3 ecosystem, Phemexia, aiming to provide users with greater autonomy and cultivate a robust community where trust and permissionless collaboration are paramount.\n“Phemex is at the forefront as the crypto world evolves far beyond just digital cash, spearheading the charge into a digital ecosystem integral to our online lives,\" Chan says. \"Our users want democratized financial tools with uncompromising security, and we\u0027re delivering just that. We\u0027re pioneering in the Web3 space, answering the call with innovations like our new hybrid stack. It combines on-chain autonomy with reliable centralized performance, showcased by our latest offering – the Phemex Lending Protocol.\nSoon, users will be able to enhance our exchange\u0027s liquidity and earn rewards using our AMM protocol. We\u0027re eager to drive more innovation and sustain our collaborations with visionary partners in upcoming integrations and listings.”\nWhile Phemex’s PT token may be the most successful exchange-native coin this year, Phemex also generated a lot of buzz with the launch of its new SocialFi product Pulse. The platform elevates community groups within the social media realm by offering a decentralized hub, similar to a mix of Telegram\u0027s groups and Twitter\u0027s connectivity, but within the realm of Web3. Pulse sets itself apart with a unique reward system where community interaction directly earns users PT, a feature unmatched by any other social network.\nPhemex is now gearing up for the launch of Pulse Season 3, responding to community feedback by enhancing the platform with features that incentivize superior content. With the introduction of “Cast” for sharing insightful content and “Tip” as a way to appreciate high-quality engagement, users can now earn tips for their casts, increasing their chances of winning a portion of the daily 10,000 PT prize pool and ensuring that outstanding content is rewarded.\nUltimately, the team’s goal is to expand Web3 use cases into the broader world. The more people get comfortable with blockchain technology and functions, the more widely digital assets will gain acceptance – and the faster these assets will appreciate in value.\n“Our mission is rooted in providing a user-centric ecosystem that offers the best trading experiences alongside a vibrant community. As we roll out our hybrid stack with the Phemex Lending launch, we\u0027re simultaneously fine-tuning Pulse based on user insights,” Chan says. “Community-driven development is pivotal to Pulse\u0027s growth, and with Season 3 on the horizon, we aim to reward the creation and engagement of premium content. We are dedicated to nurturing a community where meaningful interaction is recognized and rewarded.”\n",

    "type": "Learn",
    "summary": "BlockFi, a crypto lending company, was founded in October 2017 and filed for bankruptcy just over five years later in the wake of FTX\u0027s collapse.\n",
    "content": "Crypto lender BlockFi is kaput. The platform, which offered high yields on crypto deposits, has filed for bankruptcy protection. It’s the latest company to fall after the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Indeed, bankruptcy filings show that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. But how did it all go so wrong? CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture.\nZac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company’s chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral.\nVenture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer.\nFlush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it \"doesn’t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.” As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn’t seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company.\nThe firm’s next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts.\nIn December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood’s business model. “Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,” BlockFi’s CEO said.\nPeter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led BlockFi’s $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping “BlockFi expand into Singapore” and the Asia-Pacific region.\nBlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to “crypto payment rails” such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren\u0027t already cryptocurrency owners.” The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform.\nAll was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee’s phone with a “SIM swap” that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee’s phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi’s retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi’s customers.\nIn August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors.\nIn October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk\u0027s parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020.\nBlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin.\nEarly in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale’s product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\nAll was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin’s soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong?\nNew Jersey’s Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state’s financial regulator claimed BlockFi’s interest accounts amounted to sales of an “unregistered security” and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers.\nThe CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that – and it didn’t end well for BlockFi (we’ll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card.\nIn February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. “Today’s settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.\nIn June, BlockFi’s valuation sank to $1 billion in a “down round” – a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund\u0027s collateral before its bankruptcy. In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi’s main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection.\nIn dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren’t met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S.\nAt the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11.\nThat was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX’s credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid “the lack of clarity” about FTX. On Nov. 11, California’s financial regulator revoked BlockFi’s lending license.\nBlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried\u0027s Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan.\nIn the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX. All the while, one question looms: Will customers get anything back?\nRead More: Latest BlockFi Stories\n",

Users on X and Reddit largely seemed to consider the image as a sign to lock into trading markets.\nStocks related to Gill and other “meme stocks,” surged. GME prices were up as high as 44% in pre-market trading, and surged as high as 100% on market open before trading was halted. Cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE: AMC) was up 12% in pre-market, rising to as much as 30% after open.\nAn unaffiliated GameStop meme coin on the Solana blockchain surged more than 550%, DEXTools data shows, while an AMC token jumped 1,200%. Some microcap cat-themed meme coins such as kitty (KITTY) rose thousands of percent, while larger tokens popcat (POPCAT) and mog (MOG) rose over 15%. Larger-cap meme coins (DOGE) and (SHIB) were higher by 5% and 7%, respectively.\nData shows that opportunistic developers issued a slew of tokens referring to Gill, TheRoaringKitty, GameStop, and “stonks” – a meme term for stocks—in the past 24 hours.\nGill’s analysis of the video game retailer GameStop on Reddit, starting in 2019 and gaining traction during the COVID pandemic, created a viral phenomenon at the time. It was largely cited as a driving factor in the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021 as several small-time traders banded together and purchased options and leveraged shares of the company.\nThe stock rose from $4 to over $120 in a month and, at its peak, was up thousands of percent from its lifetime low of 64 cents in April 2020.\nGill’s initial $53,000 investment was worth nearly $50 million at its peak, emerging as a rags-to-riches story of a lone trader making a fortune from his bedroom by betting against hedge funds. One of the most prolific losers was Melvin Capital, a fund that lost billions of dollars betting on the decline of meme stocks, among other bets that move against it.\n",

    "title": "Why William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s Price",
    "type": "Learn",
    "summary": "Recently released emails from former SEC director William Hinman have rallied the XRP troops, but the documents are not a smoking gun.\n",
    "content": "On June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC\u0027s lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case.\nHere’s why:\nVery broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly.\nRipple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators.\nEarly analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails’ release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front.\nAhead of the documents’ release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn’t a security if it is “sufficiently decentralized.” That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is “sufficiently decentralized” and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman.\nCritics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token – and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security.\nRipple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called “Ripple” even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders “gifted” 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as “Ripple.”\nRead More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency?\nTo critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of “decentralization theater.” And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures.\nIn any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple\u0027s side of the case, XRP\u0027s price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.\nSee Also: Ripple Does Not Care Whether XRP Is “Sufficiently Decentralized”\n",

    "type": "Opinion",
    "summary": "In a highly technical overview of an exploit that has since been patched, government prosecutors find that exploiting code is a crime. CoinDesk reached out to several experts in the Ethereum community to get their views on the case.\n",
    "content": "The U.S. Department of Justice charged two brothers with orchestrating an attack on Ethereum trading bots, charging them with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. In essence, the brothers found a way to target bots that were frontrunning transactions in a process called maximal extractable value, or MEV, which refers to the amount of money that can be bled out of the block production process by ordering transactions.\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.\nMEV, which itself is controversial, can be a highly lucrative game dominated by automated bots that often comes at blockchain users’ expense, which is partially why so many in the crypto community have rushed to denounce the DOJ’s complaint. However, this is hardly a Robinhood situation, where two brothers, Anton and James Peraire-Bueno, of Bedford, Massachusetts, were stealing from the rich to give to the poor.\nAs indicated by the DOJ’s filing, the brothers brought in approximately $25 million in at least eight separate transactions in what, according to the DOJ, was a highly orchestrated and premeditated plot. They set up shell companies and searched for ways to safely launder funds to avoid detection. The highly technical complaint spells out the process by which the exploit occurred, which the DOJ calls “the very first of its kind.”\n“They used a flaw in MEV boost to push invalid signatures to preview bundles. That gives an unfair advantage via an exploit,” former employee of the Ethereum Foundation and Flashbots Hudson Jameson told CoinDesk in an interview. Jameson added that the Peraire-Bueno brothers were also running their own validator while extracting MEV, which violates something of a gentleman’s agreement in MEV circles.\n“No one else in the MEV ecosystem was doing both of those things at once that we know of,” he added. “They did more than just play by both the codified and pinky promise rules of MEV extraction.”\n“It\u0027s not some kind of robin hood story as they didn\u0027t return the money to people MEVers extracted it from,” pseudonymous researcher Banteg said.\nAt a more technical level, the brothers were able to exploit an open-source built by MEV firm Flashbots called mev-boost that gave them an unequal view into how MEV bots were ordering transactions. (Mev-boost is an open-source protocol that allows different actors to compete to “build” the most valuable blocks by ordering transactions.)\n“Having access to the block body allowed the malicious proposer to extract transactions from the stolen block and use them in their own block where it could exploit those transactions. In particular, the malicious proposer constructed their own block that broke the sandwich bots’ sandwiches up and effectively stole their money,” according to a Flashbots’ post-mortem in 2023.\nIn particular, and central to the DOJ’s case, is that the brothers found a way to sign false transactions in order to run the scheme. “This False Signature was designed to, and did, trick the Relay to prematurely release the content of the proposed block to the defendants, including private transaction information,” the document reads.\n“The invalid header part is going to be the needle that this all balances on I think,” a crypto researcher, who asked to remain anonymous, said.\n“I feel the indictment indicates that and therefore it may actually be a good thing that SDNY is verryyyy tech savvy in this and clearly layed out where they fucked up and alluded to the inevitability of MEV in blockchains,” Jameson said.\nOthers have also noted the technical sophistication of the DOJ’s argument, which seems to be less of an indictment of MEV or Ethereum itself than of an attempt to profit by unfairly gaining information.\n“If you hope Ethereum will always be a ‘dark forest’ where on-chain predators compete with each other for arbitrage opportunities, then you probably dislike this prosecution,” Consensys General Counsel Bill Hughes told CoinDesk in an interview. “Thankfully, I think there are only a few who are actually like that. If you prefer predatory behavior like this be curtailed, which is the vast majority, then you are likely to feel the opposite.”\nSee also: Ethereum Has Gatekeepers (for Good Reason) | Opinion\n“All of the defendants\u0027 preparation for the attack and their completely ham-fisted attempts to cover their tracks afterwards, including extensive incriminating google searches, just helps the government prove they intended to steal. All that evidence will look very bad to a jury. I suspect they plead guilty at some point,” he added.\nStill, others remain convinced that exploiting MEV bots designed to reorder transactions is fair game. “It\u0027s a little hard to sympathize with MEV bots and block builders getting f*cked over by block proposers, in the exact same way they are f*cking over end users,” the anonymous researcher said.\nJameson, for his part, said the MEV is something the Ethereum community should work to minimize on Ethereum, but that it’s a difficult problem to solve. For now, the process is “inevitable.”\n“Until it can be eliminated, let\u0027s study it. Let\u0027s illuminate it. Let\u0027s minimize it. And since it does exist, let\u0027s make it as open as possible for anyone to participate with the same rules,” he said.\nIf there is any silver lining, the Flashbots team were able to patch the error that enabled the attack fairly quickly, Cornell Tech professor Ari Juels said.\n“There are no lasting implications,” he added. “There is of course an irony in what took place: A thief stealing money from sandwich bots, which themselves exploit users in the view of many in the community.”\n",

A new version is bringing the hype back.\nFriend.Tech, a blockchain-based social application that allows crypto personalities on X to issue shares for access to closed group chats, has seen a resurgence in activity and value locked.\nRecent developments, including a possible FRIEND token and expansion beyond X, have renewed interest in the platform.\nMore than $7 million has flowed into the platform in anticipation of the developments.\n",
    "content": "Money is flowing back into social application Friend.Tech as a new version teases an eventual airdrop, bringing users back to what was among the biggest revenue-generating platforms during the bear market.\nOver $7 million flowed to Friend.Tech last week after months of outflows, boosting the value locked to nearly $40 million, data shows. Weekly fees have crossed $1.3 million for the first time since November, making the platform over $600,000 in revenue.\nBuilt on Base, a layer-2 network, Friend.Tech lets crypto personalities on X issue “shares” for access to a closed group chat. For users, the allure of these chats is that their owners could offer trading insights, token picks or access to seed-funding deals – which raises the value of the shares.\nThe bump in activity precedes the coming of version 2 of the application, which developers said will be released after April 20. A key element of the update is expanding the platform beyond X to attract newer users.\nOver the weekend, developers also teased a FRIEND token. Expectations among users are that these could be distributed based on how many points – a reward for Friend.Tech usage – they accumulate before the token release.\nFriend.tech was earning in excess of $1 million per day in fees at its August peak after going viral on X and gaining more than 100,000 unique users, a significant number for crypto application standards. Shares of some crypto X personalities, such as @Cobie and @HsakaTrades, jumped to as much as three ether, or nearly $5,000, at the time.\nActivity fell off in the months following as the initial allure wore off. Security risks later marred the platform alongside opportunities elsewhere in the sector, leading to months of outflows since November.\n",

    "summary": "“Roaring Kitty is living proof that retail can mog (outperform) institutions at the highest level,” one meme coin developer said.\nMeme coins surged after a post by Keith Gill, a retail trader whose online persona and investment strategies contributed to the GameStop short squeeze in 2021.\nThe meme coin surge was not limited to microcap tokens but also impacted larger tokens like Pepe and Floki.\n",
    "content": "Top meme coins climbed higher Tuesday after a viral post by retail trader Keith Gill, whose cult following contributed to the GameStop short squeeze of 2021, sent some stocks and tokens flying at the start of the week.\nGill, who turned $58,000 into an estimated $50 million between 2019 and 2021 by buying GameStop (GME) options, sparked a run in the stock after posting from his @TheRoaringKitty X account for the first time in three years. A mere picture posted by Gill sent the stock skywards, nearly doubling in value on Monday despite multiple trading halts, even as Gill did not directly mention Gamestop.\nGameSpot’s retail euphoria quickly spread to token markets. Several offshoots and joke tokens referring to GameStop, Gill, and his online kitten persona flooded Solana and Ethereum blockchains – with a meme GME token surging as much as 500%.\nA video featuring the X-Men character Wolverine posted later on by Gill caused dozens of WOLVERINE tokens floated by opportunistic developers, most falling over 90% in the hours following.\nThe action was not limited to microcaps. Larger tokens Pepe (PEPE) and floki (FLOKI), and cat-themed tokens popcat (POPCAT) and mog (MOG) jumped as much as 30% in the past 24 hours, data shows. Such revival showed an early sign of risk appetite returning to the crypto markets following weeks of relatively lull trading action.\nGill’s post revived talks of a dogecoin (DOGE) rally among some traders, similar to its 2021, which occurred after GameStop’s run from $4 to $120 in a month.\n“Roaring Kitty is living proof that retail can mog (outperform) institutions at the highest level,” MOG token developer Shisui told CoinDesk in a message. “His return was perceived as bullish for meme coins because the market remembered that much of the Gamestop mania of 2021 spilled over to $DOGE and other meme coins.”\n“While we are far from being in a true risk-on environment, the price movements after Roaring Kitty’s comeback hint at which assets will outperform when frothy conditions return. The market has shown its hand, and it wants $MOG,” Shisui added.\nAmong developers and traders, part of Gill’s influential appeal isn’t only that he has made generational wealth: It’s the allure of a single trader taking down hedge funds from his bedroom using publicly available tools and the chance of them landing a similar move.\nThat has contributed to the general acceptance of meme tokens and made the sector a strong contender to DeFi and utility crypto projects compared to previous cycles, some opine.\n“The industry is only just starting to come to grasp with memes being fun, relatable, enjoyable, and representative of the average person,” said B, lead developer at Floki, in a note to CoinDesk. “The vast majority of retail is flocking over to meme coins and ignoring the tired old \"utility\" crypto projects.”\n“While many are worried about the \"lack of fundamentals surrounding meme coins\" and the implications of the continued attention they are getting for the space, the strong interest in meme coins was something I predicted years ago,” B said. He pointed out that Floki has now been focused on utility products to engage its audience that initially purchased the tokens as simply a meme.\n",

    "type": "Policy",
    "summary": "President Biden\u0027s emergency order to halt the Chinese-tied mining on the doorstep of a nuclear-missile base hit days after mining giant CleanSpark struck a deal to buy the property.\nCleanSpark had just finished hailing the benefits of its purchase of a Wyoming crypto-mining site when the White House declared that the current operation was a national security threat that must be halted.\nThe company says it was unaware of the order before buying the properties but intends to move forward with the acquisition.\nOrder would mark first \"the first presidential prohibition relying on the expanded authority over real estate transactions granted to CFIUS and the president.\"\n",
    "content": "An American bitcoin mining company, CleanSpark (CLSK), got caught up in the U.S.-China political war after buying mining sites in Wyoming within close proximity of a U.S. nuclear missile base from MineOne, a company with Chinese ties.\nOn Monday, President Joe Biden ordered a bitcoin mining facility near Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming to stop operations, citing a threat to national security as it uses foreign-sourced technology. The order said that MineOne is majority-owned by Chinese nationals, and all mining equipment on the property must be removed from within a mile of the military facility in Cheyenne, which houses Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).\nWhile this may not be a surprising move in itself, the timing stands out, as MineOne sold the sites to CleanSpark less than a week prior to the order.\nOn May 9, CleanSpark said it was buying two mining sites for nearly $19 million in cash, with a 45-day closing, without naming a specific seller. The miner said it will deploy China-based Bitmain\u0027s latest generation mining machine, noting that it plans to expand the sites by an additional 55 megawatts (MW) from 75MW.\nA spokesperson for CleanSpark said the company was unaware of the order prior to buying the mining sites but acknowledged the concerns in the executive order and intends to press forward with the deal.\n\"The executive order and the involvement of CFIUS, both of which we were unaware of before signing the deal, has added an unexpected layer to the closing process, but we are working through these developments toward a satisfactory closing,\" the spokesperson told CoinDesk in a statement.\n\"We respect the oversight process and are dedicated to ensuring that our operations bolster national security and benefit economic development, particularly in Wyoming, a state that has been at the forefront of developing and nurturing a pro-Bitcoin environment,\" the statement said.\nNeither MineOne nor lawyers at Loeb \u0026 Loeb who handled the property deal for the company responded to requests for comment.\nThe details of the $19 million deal, though, were fully described in filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from CleanSpark. The purchase was highly dependent on the securing of massive amounts of energy required to run the business.\nThe larger of the two properties is about 4,000 feet from the closest edge of Warren Air Force Base.\nFrom MineOne, the sale agreement was signed by Jiaming Li, identified as the company\u0027s director. Li, who couldn\u0027t be reached by CoinDesk for comment, has also been president of China Xiangtai Food Co., a partner in TCC Capital and reportedly managed almost $12 billion in assets at Sinatay Insurance Co.\nHe has a doctorate in economics from Fordham University, according to past press releases. Li was also briefly the president of Bit Origin Ltd., a MineOne investor and a company that was reported to have garnered similar scrutiny previously from Washington.\nThe SEC-disclosed contract with CleanSpark outlined a due diligence period extending 15 days from the May 8 date the deal was signed, and the purchase could be scrapped if MineOne didn\u0027t satisfy several conditions, including \"government compliance matters.\"\n\"I have been deeply involved in National Security affairs for nearly four decades, and am well aware of the potential risks of many different types of encroachment on important defense infrastructure,\" said Tom Wood, a CleanSpark board member who once served in senior U.S. Navy roles and as a military analyst, in a statement. \"The presence of a CCP-owned data processing facility near a facility like Warren which houses a portion of the nation’s ICBM force is legitimate cause for concern as noted by the president’s order.\"\nHe said he\u0027s familiar with the CFIUS process, calling it \"impartial, data-driven and non-arbitrary,\" and he said that if the U.S. mining business can address the concerns in the order, \"I would consider this a significant win-win for the United States and for CleanSpark.\"\nThis use of Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) powers to shut down the acquisition by owners tied to China marked the eighth time the president has used the authority – seven of which involved China, according to lawyers at Hogan Lovells who specialize in this issue. Anne Salladin and Brian Curran said in an emailed analysis that this was \"the first presidential prohibition relying on the expanded authority over real estate transactions granted to CFIUS and the president under the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018.\"\n",

    "type": "Opinion",
    "summary": "The pseudonymous investor – early to both Ethereum and Litecoin – has lived large. He is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.\n",
    "content": "It’s quite likely that Otoh has lost more bitcoin than most people will ever hold. An early bitcoin investor, Otoh, a pseudonym that stands for “on the other hand,” has many lessons to share about finding opportunities and making one’s own luck.\nOtoh is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.\nScheduled to speak on stage at Consensus 2024, in Austin, Texas, alongside crypto luminaries like Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and BTCC and Ballet founder Bobby Lee, Otoh is known among the early crypto crowd for his massive holdings of physical bitcoins – a.k.a. Casascius coins.\n“I\u0027ve never sold any. I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage,” Otoh told CoinDesk in an interview, discussing his recent auction of over 200 worth of physical bitcoins in what was the Heritage auction firm’s first crypto sale.\nCasascius coins, created by Mike Caldwell (who went by Casascius, an acronym for “call a spade a spade,” on Bitcoin forums), were a solution to spending bitcoin in face-to-face transactions by embedding a Bitcoin private key in a metal coin.\nThe last ones were made in 2013 after the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network told Caldwell that he was operating an unlicensed money transmitter business. There are only about 90,000 Casascius coins in circulation, of varying denominations, though other manufacturers including Bobby Lee created their own versions.\nA part of Bitcoin lore and its physical history, Casascius coins are now sought after by collectors (some are so valuable that they have to be declared to U.S. Customs when entering the country). In some sense, these coins are the most long lived and recognizable image of the purely a digital currency.\n“It seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go,” Otoh said. “Let other people look after them and enjoy having them.”\nOf course, part of the danger of bringing bitcoin into the physical realm is that it makes the assets as easy to steal as a $20 note from mom’s purse – and unfortunately, Otoh thinks he was the victim of a theft about a decade ago. He recounted a story of receiving a shipment of coins where the box had been obviously tampered with.\nThe 55 BTC missing from his collection were worth about $20,000 at the time they were purchased, and are now worth about $3.5 million, “which is a huge sum in most anyone\u0027s book,” he said. “I\u0027m very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn\u0027t want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me,” he added.\nSee also: Why, for Some, Crypto Is the Defining Political Issue of Our Times | Opinion\nCoinDesk caught up with Otoh ahead of Consensus to discuss his recent auction of vintage physical bitcoins, early investments in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum’s initial coin offering and how he manages his wealth by diversifying into properties around the world and residing in a tax haven in the British Channel Islands.\nCould you give a sense of what you’re talking about at Consensus?\nI’m on the panel about physical bitcoins. I\u0027m basically a fill-in for Mike Caldwell, who invented Casascius coins, who couldn\u0027t make it unfortunately.\nOh, that\u0027s so cool.\nWould be nice to meet him one day. Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee asked if I\u0027d be a substitute for the gap on the panel because I am a large investor.\nDo you remember buying your first coin?\nYes, very much. It was at the London Bitcoin Conference in 2012. I had just started on bitcoin in the summer of 2011, around July. I remember at the time I met with some German guys – there were all these privacy advocates wearing masks who had a whole bunch of physical coins to sell. I believe it was 10 regular bitcoins and a 10 bitcoin unit piece. The price at the time, with the premium and everything, was $12 a bitcoin.\nWhat does Otoh stand for?\nIt’s an acronym for “on the other hand.” That\u0027s how it\u0027s usually used. I just adopted it because I find myself, a lot of the time, not necessarily being argumentative but looking at different viewpoints. I thought bitcoin and crypto is also a different way of looking at finance. Nearly everyone had a nickname on the BitcoinTalk forum. That\u0027s the way that came about, but I didn\u0027t give it much thought at the time. It was just the first thing that came into my head.\nAre there any particular memories of the early days of Bitcoin that you remember fondly?\nFondly? Yes, that must be getting my first coin – that was a big deal. At the time people were still giving away free coins. By the time I joined, word had spread, and it often wasn\u0027t a full coin anymore, just a fraction of a coin, but it was still fun to have my own address and then be sent this little token amount of coins to see how it could function.\nAt the time I was traveling between Europe and the States quite a bit and also buying and selling in Europe and the States. With bitcoin, it suddenly became really easy to send money.\nA few of the other memories are more traumatic. It\u0027s very easy to mess up. As you learn as you go.\nYou\u0027ve probably lost more bitcoins than most people have today.\nIf you count the ones that were stolen off me. Like that list I just gave you that I put together from nine years ago. Somewhere out there there is a lost, stolen treasure of a few million dollars.\nWhat do you suspect happened there? A rogue employee?\nI think it is most likely a rogue U.S. Postal Service employee who just used a box cutter and saw something that looked promising. He probably thought it was Gold Eagles or Silver Eagles or something. I don\u0027t know what the reaction would be, whether they were disgusted to see it was just some weird tokens and threw them away or whether they thought “Oh, this looks cool.”\nI’ve always hoped that I’d have a brainstorm and remember if I’ve stashed them away somewhere. But it doesn\u0027t make any sense – I\u0027ve got everything else very well looked after and itemized. A friend of mine whose house I had been staying in at that time remembers receiving a box that was cut open and resealed.\nIs there anything that you want to say about the OTOH Collection of Physical Cryptocurrency?\nWell, after a decade, I decided it\u0027s time to sell. I\u0027ve never sold any, I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage. Now that I\u0027ve sold all my digital crypto, it seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go. Let other people look after them and enjoy having them.\nYou\u0027re also a real estate investor. At this point, do you think it’s better for people to invest in bitcoin or physical property?\nI think it’s a mixture of the two. Bitcoin is high-risk, but potentially it has very high returns. And property is a hedge. It\u0027s a safety net. It\u0027s also very hard to steal, whereas bitcoins can be very easy to steal.\nIf I was still in my 20s, then I\u0027d probably be keeping a much higher percentage in crypto, but nowadays I like the security of having a bunch of properties and enjoy renovating them.\nAre you interested in other digital assets?\nIn the past I pretty much have been. I was the largest holder of litecoin (LTC) when it was a few cents. I think I had roughly 600,000. It was the first altcoin, and was quite controversial with Bitcoin Maximalists. They disliked it intensely because they thought it withdrew funds and interest away from Bitcoin. But I was quite convinced from the first time I saw it, it\u0027s impossible for anything to exist without its opposite.\nAnd so that paid out very well. After Litecoin, I moved into Dash and was the largest holder of those and helped develop the project in some ways. And then I kind of lost interest and moved onto other things. I was highly recommended Ethereum at a Dutch conference and participated in the ICO. I got 100 bitcoins worth, which was 210,000 ether (ETH). Unfortunately, I sold those way too soon. I made 100% or 200% profit, but I sold them for something like $2. So I will rue the potential $800 million there. Otherwise I\u0027m pretty much fully bitcoin nowadays.\nThe way you discussed bitcoin earlier in the conversation you discussed it mostly as a method of transaction. Are you convinced by the arguments that it has properties like gold?\nI think it is excellent as an investment. I think that\u0027s its main use at the moment. It’s perhaps the best performing investment in history, and it continues to grow. It is a trillion dollar asset class, and a great way to store value. Satoshi viewed it in the beginning as a hedge against the degenerate behavior of central governments and banks abusing the currencies that we will have to use every day. It\u0027s much more versatile than gold, in that it can be transferred pretty much anywhere around the world from anyone to anyone, instantly, with no armored trucks or anything and next to no fees. It\u0027s quite miraculous really, that it\u0027s come into existence. It\u0027s still very early days, but it really has transformed the world in many many ways.\nWhat have been your biggest purchases made with crypto?\nI must admit I\u0027ve done very little with buying and selling with crypto. I go from fiat currency into crypto and then back out to fiat currency.\nCapital gains taxes make spending crypto sort of annoying, to some extent.\nFor many people it would, yes. I\u0027m fortunate that I am based in a tax haven where there isn\u0027t any capital gains tax. I make sure that I\u0027m physically there when I cash any out. So I don\u0027t have that issue. There\u0027s also no income tax.\nYou mentioned you have a home in California. How do you balance the tax situation there, where state tax authorities may want to charge you income tax?\nI’ve got homes in many countries around the world; it doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m suddenly a tax resident. I make sure I count my days very carefully – I don’t overstay. As long as I\u0027m not here for more than six months of the year, I won\u0027t be liable for any tax. And I don\u0027t do any business here.\nDo you mind if I ask what tax haven?\nIt’s a little island in the British Channel Islands called Sark. It’s a three square mile island and fairly unique in the world for having next to no tax. You just pay a small proportion of your property tax as a contribution to the kind of upkeep of the island. The main thing about it that\u0027s attractive is you don\u0027t have to keep records of what you\u0027re doing, which would have been hugely complicated when I was converting altcoins into bitcoin and then into other alternative currencies and then back into dollars. I pity the people who had to try and keep these records and then present them to a tax authority – it must be a nightmare.\nDid you give up your passport?\nNo, I still keep a U.K. passport. I could trade it in for a Guernsey passport, which is the main island in the channel. It\u0027s really just a clone of the U.K.. It has all the same benefits, but I haven\u0027t bothered to do it. It doesn\u0027t really matter what nationality I have. It really only matters where I\u0027m a fiscal resident.\nHow would you describe your political views?\nWell, like many people, with age I probably have become a little more conservative in some ways. But I\u0027m pretty much a capitalist; I believe that\u0027s a good way for people to behave. I\u0027m not overtly political. I was probably quite anarchist in the past. I just adapt to whatever the majority believes. I am not trying to change things myself in a big way – I’m pretty apolitical.\nIs there anything more you want to say about the possible theft of those Casascius coins?\nI believe it was 55 bitcoins in value, something like $3.5 million at present value. At the time they were lost or taken they were only worth about $13,000. Still a lot but nothing compared to right now. So I\u0027m very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn\u0027t want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me.\nSee also: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: What You Need to Know\nOne day, I expect they\u0027ll turn up unless they\u0027ve gone on a destructive route somehow. Everyone can see the addresses; I was really surprised when I checked a couple of weeks ago that they had never been moved and that they hadn\u0027t been peeled. So they\u0027re probably out there somewhere.\nLast question, what are you looking forward to at Consensus?\nWell, meeting Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee again. They both in their own ways have been very instrumental in helping me with my crypto journey. Charlie Lee by inventing Litecoin, where I did extremely well – probably even better than I did with bitcoin. And Bobby Lee for having BTCC (also known as BTCChina) and the physical coins. He produced physical coins just like Mike\u0027s Casascius coins. I have still got all my BTCC coins. That will be a future auction.\nI\u0027ve had quite a few adventures with the physical coins. I had to physically go to Shanghai to pick them up, as they couldn\u0027t be shipped at the time. That was an adventure in itself.\nThere\u0027s other people that I know from forums and interacting with on the internet who I\u0027m sure it would be nice to see again in person if I\u0027ve met them at other conferences. It\u0027s a chance to put people together and exchange ideas that if one just sat behind a computer at home, perhaps wouldn\u0027t happen.\nSo I\u0027m looking forward to it. It\u0027s quite exciting. It\u0027s my first visit to Texas.\n",

And much of the world has so little water that it’s a matter of life and death.\nSo how can we send water from areas of surplus to areas of need? This is the mission of Atlantis, a project devoted to solving issues stemming from climate change, focusing primarily on water. And they’re trying to crack this problem by using blockchain. Irthu Suresh is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.\nAtlantis is not just theoretical. Across 50 villages in the region of Chikmagalur, India, Atlantis deployed a Web3 solution that incentivized people to effectively transfer water from the Haves to the Have Nots. A clever system of “bounties” encouraged villagers to perform tasks that enabled this new distribution. And the pilot program worked. “We’ve exchanged more than 21,000 kiloliters of water,” says Irthu Suresh, CEO of Atlantis.\nGiving a sneak preview of what he’ll share in Austin at Consensus, Suresh explains why Atlantis adopted blockchain, the challenges they had to overcome for onboarding, and why he wants the world to know that Web3 is not just for trading but that “we can use this to fight water problems, to fight poverty.”\nInterview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.\nAtlantis didn’t start out as a blockchain organization, but eventually you incorporated the tech. What led you to this?\nIrthu Suresh: We were trying to build solutions for climate change — primarily through water — as a Web2 company, but a private entity trying to build for the commons was not really striking a chord. And we ran into all kinds of challenges with existing power structures, everything from regulations to unregulated mafia in India. It’s very easy to bring down an idea if it’s built by a private entity. All you need is a bunch of lawyers.\nAnd that led us to think, “How can me and my co-founder become insignificant over time as this system scales?\" And that led us to look at decentralized distributed systems. We figured that if this works, no one should be able to bring it down.\nThen we realized that there were people who were willing to harvest additional water and then supply it into the network. This was creating additional pools of surplus resources. And we were like, “What if we could build this entire system on blockchain?”\nSo what does that look like exactly?\nIn most parts of the world, things like water are heavily regulated. And you have these centralized grids. But as cities and spaces expand, often these centralized grids struggle to catch up.\nBut India is a great example of being built, historically, on decentralized communities. You have small pockets of villages taking care of their needs. It\u0027s hyper-local. So for us, it was a no-brainer to bring some kind of concept that solves for resource allocation problems.\nThere are some parts where water is abundant, and nobody cares about it. And there are other places where access to water is life and death. So for the pilot, when we partnered with Mercy Corps Ventures, we chose a specific location in India where on one side of this hill there’s an abundance of water, and on the other side of the hill there’s a drought. And how could people in this region exchange this excess water? How could we create the infrastructure locally itself? So for our pilot program in Chikmagalur — a rural region with 50 villages — we started with people in different water stress zone.\nInteresting. What did your system do?\nFirst we had people locally volunteer to spread awareness, then we had local people sign up to become water harvesters. Once we had these harvesters and there was a rain that was captured, there was an opportunity for it to be exchanged.\nHow does blockchain fit into this?\nWe built the product on a mobile native app. On this app, everybody could create a profile, sign up, and first mention what their skill is. And based on the skill, we start giving you tasks. And these tasks are pretty much to build up this peer-to-peer water network.\nYou could take part in surveying, you could take part in water sample testing, you could sign up as someone who wants to spread awareness through workshops, or you could become a harvester. All of these tasks are gamified; we call them bounties. People sign up and then they do the required steps that are required, and then they get incentivized. We knew this first required a distributed ledger that is tamper-proof, and we knew that blockchain is useful for that.\nAmazing. Can you quantify the impact so far?\nYeah. We’ve exchanged more than 21,000 kiloliters of water. The network has over 3,000 people and it\u0027s covering 50 villages. Out of the 3,000, predominantly most are consumers who are coming into the network to access water. But we have almost 150 harvesters in the network. And then we have a bunch of surveyors and validators.\nWhat’s a validator in this context?\nLet’s say you plug into the network and say, \"Hey, I\u0027m a harvester.\" Then we put out a bounty for someone in the locality to become a validator, who goes to your place and just validates that, \"Hey, these guys have the infrastructure for it.\" So what happens, in essence, is we’re creating a bunch of these local green jobs. And all of these different tasks are gamified using our bounty system.\nWhat problems did you run into?\nOne was off-ramping. Especially in India, it\u0027s tough to off-ramp, because the regulations are still in a gray area.\nAnd then starting from the first MVP we designed, at the very onset of onboarding, whenever we asked people to connect to a wallet, that didn\u0027t work. Because people were like, \"What\u0027s a wallet?\" And I got an absolute schooling on UI and UX. We had to really figure out when is the right place to introduce blockchain or the Web3 terminologies.\nAnd we had to take extra steps to educate people about it. Because people are like, ”Oh, it\u0027s crypto. That means it\u0027s a scam.” And we’re like, “No, no, hold on!” Right? Like, there\u0027s so much more to it!\nWhat tokens are you using to drive the mechanics?\nWe do have an internal token, which we\u0027ll someday launch. During the pilot we actively used it. But seeing how the Web3 market works, we are strong believers that unless we hit a strong product-market fit, launching a token doesn\u0027t make sense for us.\nSo we’ve integrated a mechanism in which different tokens can be brought into the platform. If someone wants to fund a water project in Africa using Solana they can, whereas if somebody wants to do a water project in Vietnam using Optimism, they\u0027re able to do that. We really worked on the interoperability aspect of it because climate change does not care which chain you are on.\nWell said. Last question: What are you most looking forward to at Consensus?\nSo, one of the biggest lifelines for our project has been Bitcoin. And I know that Consensus is a great place to go and meet people who have pioneered some of these technologies we are using today.\nI\u0027m hoping that we\u0027re able to come and talk about the things that we’ve been doing with blockchain, which is not necessarily just DeFi trading. We really want people to know that, “Hey, we can use this to fight water problems, to fight poverty.\" The idea of distributed ledgers is super powerful. More people need to know that there\u0027s actual examples of this being played out.\nGreat sentiment. Congrats on what you’ve built and see you in Austin.\n",

    "content": "Activity on the Bitcoin Runes protocol has slowed over the past week, a sign it has failed to generate meaningful traction among users despite a stellar start last month.\nRunes takes the Ordinals protocol a step further by making transactions even cheaper and faster. Ordinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.\nThe much-hyped Runes went live after Bitcoin’s fourth halving on April 20. Data tracked on Dune Analytics shows that in its first 10 days the protocol racked up more than 85,000 token issuances and generated over $3 million in fees.\nIn the past two weeks, however, all the metrics – including fees, new Runes and user activity – have dropped more than 50%. Only some 5,000 new Runes have been issued since May 1, generating just under $100,000 in fees.\nAt its peak, Runes led transactions and fees in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, accounting for as much as 80% of all network activity. Now it\u0027s 20%. Worth noting, however, is that the downturn came amid a general market decline marked by falling bitcoin (BTC) prices and slow growth in alternative tokens, which may have contributed to a drop in sentiment for novel technology.\nRunes generated massive interest on social platform X before its launch with creator Casey Rodamor aiming to make it a protocol ripe for meme coin trading and “degen” traders. Some industry participants expected the protocol to mirror the flourishing meme coin ecosystem on blockchains such as Solana and Base – likely fueling interest and bets on little-known memes.\nPUPS, a Runes token, emerged as a big play and surged from under $10 million capitalization to over $150 million in under a week, gaining support from several noted traders such as BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes.\nSeveral NFT collections and tokens were launched on Ordinals, and even on Ethereum, before the protocol\u0027s introduction – each aiming to transfer over and become the biggest compilation after the launch. Such activity made Bitcoin-based NFTs top other collections on the usual leaders Ethereum and Solana, with tens of millions exchanging hands in an otherwise scant market for non-fungible tokens.\nSome skeptics say that while Runes may serve as a way to build the Bitcoin ecosystem, there’s still work to be done.\n\"The success of the Bitcoin L2 project based on OP_Return is doubtful as UTXO based blockchain network is fundamentally different from smart contract based network,\" Ho Chan Chung, head of marketing at CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. \"The current notion of Bitcoin narrative as a digital currency combined, and the difference in the blockchain network fundamental are the two big hurdles that Bitcoin L2 projects need to overcome.\"\n\"Lightning network was able to prove it. However, Ordinals, BRC-20, and Runes all seemed to fail at winning the narrative for now.\" Chung added.\n",

    "content": "If digital assets are the future of finance and merging legacy financial systems with crypto is the key to this new system, Sergey Nazarov – the co-founder of the decentralized oracle network Chainlink – is one of the driving forces behind this revolution.\nChainlink (LINK) is bringing traditional finance (TradFi) firms and banks into the blockchain space, including heavy hitters such as SWIFT, DTCC, ANZ and more. The Chainlink network has enabled over $9 trillion in transaction value since 2022.\nThis profile is part of CoinDesk\u0027s Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here. Nazarov is a speaker at CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus 2024 festival, May 29-31, in Austin, Texas.\nThe company, Chainlink Labs, founded in 2017, and distinct from the Chainlink protocol, has come a long way from building \"just an oracle\" system. It is also a pioneer in Web3 services for data, compute, cross-chain interoperability and connecting capital markets to the world of digital assets.\nThe token securing the network and used for payment of node operators that process requests – LINK – has been one of the top performers this year, rising more than 150% with a market capitalization of $8 billion.\nChainlink is accomplishing this by adhering to its three pillars: data, computation and cross-chain interoperability, Nazarov said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk.\nNazarov is particularly proud of Chainlink\u0027s newest offering – the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) – that banks and financial institutions are exploring to use to transact across public and private blockchains. CCIP is designed to facilitate the cross-chain applications and services, which could one day make up a global \"Internet of Contracts.\"\nAs more TradFi institutions enter the digital world, Nazarov is seeing a growing demand for blockchain infrastructure.\nIn fact, the 35-year-old entrepreneur Nazarov, the son of Russian immigrants who were engineers and moved to New York in the early \u002790s, expects more big financial institutions to roll-out various blockchain projects in the next year and beyond.\nNazarov believes this will start a race among banks, asset managers and financial industry titans, \"which will eventually be connected back to public chains, growing the crypto industry.\"\nMerging the two industries won\u0027t be a small task, even though TradFi has come a long way from brushing off digital assets as just a bubble to understanding the technology\u0027s value proposition.\n\"More and more people are waking up to the realization that our current system is built on paper promises, where critical real-world outcomes are predicated on whether individuals and institutions uphold their word,\" Nazarov said.\n\"By enabling over $9 trillion in transaction value since 2022 across a wide range of verticals, including banking, DeFi, global trade, gaming, insurance and other major sectors, the Chainlink platform is integral to realizing the verifiable web and helping to bring the largest financial institutions in the world on-chain,\" he said.\nFor the next year and beyond, Nazarov is focused on turning CCIP into the global standard for cross-chain data and value transfer for both Web3 and traditional capital markets.\nIt\u0027s fitting that he can rock both a plaid shirt and a three-piece suit, a symbol of the two worlds coming together.\nWhat\u0027s your No. 1 goal for 2024?\nTurning CCIP into the global standard for cross-chain data and value transfer for both Web3 and capital markets, so that in the following years we can combine Web3 and capital markets into a single global Internet of Contracts.\nGive us a prediction for crypto next year:\nBig financial institutions will launch various blockchain initiatives, bringing huge amounts of value onto blockchains. This will kick off a race for banks, asset managers, and financial industry infrastructures to create the best possible blockchains and smart contracts, which will eventually be connected back to public chains, growing the crypto industry.\nBiggest achievement this past year\nChainlink collaborated with Swift (the global standard for financial messaging across 11,000+ banks) and more than a dozen large financial institutions on using CCIP for blockchain interoperability. Chainlink also collaborated with DTCC (the world\u0027s largest securities settlement system, processing $2+ quadrillion annually) on bringing capital markets on-chain with CCIP. Collaboration with ANZ Bank (one the world\u0027s largest banks with $1+ trillion in total AUM) on cross-chain tokenized asset settlement with CCIP, which was explored at Sibos. Also at Sibos, Sergey Nazarov presented a keynote on connecting all on-chain markets via Chainlink CCIP.\nCCIP launched on mainnet, bringing the most secure cross-chain protocol to market to unlock the multi-chain ecosystem and onboard existing financial institutions to onchain finance. Data Streams also launched on mainnet to provide a high-performance, low-latency oracle solution for enabling ultra-fast and easy-to-use DeFi derivatives.\nChainlink has also solidified its position as a Web3 services platform for cross-chain services and all of the world\u0027s data and computation. The launch of Functions Beta, Automation 2.0, and CCIP significantly expanded Chainlink\u0027s platform, giving developers the ability to use Chainlink to power all their cross-chain and offchain needs and eliminating the need to introduce additional security assumptions when using multiple oracle services. As the industry-standard decentralized computing platform, Chainlink has now enabled over $9T in total transaction value.\n",

    "type": "Learn",
    "summary": "More people are calling for crypto companies and those behind products such as stablecoins to prove they have enough funds to pay their customers.\n",
    "content": "Regular banks do not actually hold all of your money. They lend out most of your deposits in an attempt to eke out returns from financial markets. This works, for the most part, because the bank insures deposits with the federal government and because the bank widely diversifies its exposure to risk to ensure that it won’t be caught short in the event of a financial crash.\nThis system occasionally fails in traditional finance (see: Lehman) but fails frequently in crypto. The government does not insure deposits to crypto platforms and the platforms often do not manage risk particularly well (see: FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network), making high-risk bets that end in catastrophe.\nRead More: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?\nAfter so many platforms squandered customer funds, crypto traders are thinking twice about depositing funds to crypto exchanges and lending institutions that “rehypothecate” uninsured deposits – which means they repurpose customer money and lend the funds out in the markets. A safer bet looks like trading on platforms that “fully back” their reserves. But what does this really mean, and should such claims be taken with a pinch of salt?\nWhen a financial product, such as a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to “fully back” its reserves, it means that it has stored enough money behind a product, like a stablecoin or a customer’s trading account, to support its worth.\nSo, a crypto exchange that “fully backs” its reserves should always be able to pay out customer withdrawals, no matter the state of the market. One such example is Coinbase, which does not lend out its customers’ funds without their express permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to prevent a bank run.\nA stablecoin that “fully backs” its reserves is always able to fulfill conversions to the original asset, no matter what. One example is wBTC, or wrapped bitcoin, which holds real bitcoin (BTC) in a cold wallet, then issues an equal amount of an Ethereum-based version of the coin that trades as an ERC-20 token.\nFully backed, however, does not necessarily mean that assets are held one to one. That claim refers to the idea that if you, say, give me a dollar, I’ll hold that dollar as a dollar and won’t turn it into something else. Lots of stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like U.S.-dollar stablecoin USDC, are not backed one to one.\nThis is because the companies that issue USDC hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in “cash and cash equivalents.” Cash equivalents refer to U.S. Treasury bonds, which is debt issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. These bonds, which pay small returns to holders over time, are close enough to the worth of actual U.S. dollars that the market accepts bonds being essentially worth the same.\nBut “fully backed” does not always mean that the backing can withstand financial shocks. U.S. dollar stablecoin tether (USDT) also claims that its reserves are fully backed, but this backing is secured by “other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether [the issuing company] to third parties.” So, USDT may be fully backed, but it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies.\nUntil October 2022, USDT was also backed by commercial paper – short-term commercial debt to other companies – and moved those funds to U.S. Treasurys. The concern about the commercial paper was that nobody knew which companies Tether was using to back USDT, so it was impossible to determine the worth of that backing. What’s more, its “fully backed” claim has historically turned out not to be true after it emerged in 2019 that USDT was, at one point, only 74% backed. As wrote the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u0027s Dawn D. Stump, the claim that it was backed to the U.S. dollar was “not 100% true, 100% of the time.”\nRead more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its Value\nSome stablecoins do not fully back their reserves, which has led to catastrophic results in some cases. The popular algorithmic stablecoin UST, for instance, crashed in spectacular fashion, wiping billions from the market.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, meaning it has more than enough crypto on hand to back its coin. DAI has survived several market crashes.\n\n",

    "content": "At CoinDesk, we’re not just chronicling the business model transformation that digital assets and the blockchain have made possible – we’re actively participating in it.\nAt Consensus 2021, a virtual event, we beta-tested DESK, an experiment in using tokenized rewards to incentivize engagement and community-building, garnering positive feedback from our audience. At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019.\nIn December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com.\nRead More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader Experience\nBelow is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information.\nDESK is CoinDesk’s social token.\nDESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content.\nDESK’s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together.\nAs of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include:\nAt Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as:\nDESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum.\nPolygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction.\nYou’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners.\nRead more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your Wallet\nYes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account.\nIn the Web2 era, content creators – be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers – have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines).\nWe’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms.\nWe believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal.\nWe hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event.\nSocial tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants.\nInitially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward.\nSimply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience.\nNo. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone’s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity.\nIt is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading.\nBy providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We\u0027ve seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization.\nNo. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users.\nNo. See above.\nNo. We\u0027re not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement.\nListing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use.\nIt’s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests.\nSo, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether.\nPart of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground.\nNo. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless.\nCoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon.\nBecause DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK\u0027s beta testers.\nPiranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept.\nAt Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk’s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike.\nCoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others.\nAs mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used.\nNavigate to the DESK dashboard. Select \"Create or Connect Wallet\" and approve the transaction in your wallet.\nDepends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com. We will not use this data for anything other than authenticating users when they sign on or distributing DESK rewards, we will never sell it, and we will protect user information assiduously. (See our privacy policy.) DESK transactions will appear on DESK\u0027s page on the Polyscan block explorer, but only the wallet addresses will be displayed.\nDESK has no inherent monetary value, but, whether or not you live in a jurisdiction where utility tokens are deemed taxable, you should consult a tax professional if you have concerns.\nWe’ll keep a record of airdrops, product developments and other updates critical to DESK’s roadmap and tokenomics in our DESK product blog.\nYou can also keep abreast of DESK updates in our Discord server.\nThe latest release is only the beginning in developing our Web3 model for DESK on coindesk.com. We\u0027ll be working on improving our wallet functionality, currently in beta, and looking forward to seeing what data and reader feedback reveal as to how to continue improving the experience\n",

    "type": "Technology",
    "summary": "First came \"The Bait.\" In an indictment, U.S. prosecutors detailed the incredibly complicated Ethereum exploit – in which attackers targeted the controversial area of \"maximal extractable value,\" known as MEV.\n",
    "content": "They had it all planned out.\nIn late 2022, the brothers Peraire-Bueno – twenty-something graduates of Massachusetts Institute of Technology who had turned their sights on blockchain – embarked on an effort that ultimately netted them $25 million, in one of the most sophisticated exploits in a decade or so of frequent crypto exploits. At the outset, according to U.S. prosecutors, they outlined a four-step plan.\nFirst there was \"The Bait.\" Then there was \"Unblinding the block,\" followed by \"The Search,\" and ultimately \"The Propagation.\"\n\"In the months that followed, the defendants followed each stage as outlined in their Exploit Plan,\" according to an indictment.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday charged two brothers, Anton Peraire-Bueno, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, for exploiting a vulnerability in a popular software program used by trading bots on the Ethereum blockchain, netting an estimated $25 million of gains during a 12-second exploit in April 2023.\nTheir father is Jaime Peraire, the former head of MIT\u0027s department of aeronautics and astronautics, CNBC reported.\nThe exploit happened thanks to a vulnerability that the brothers discovered in MEV-boost, a piece of software used by roughly 90% of the validators that run the blockchain, allowing them to see the transactions in blocks before they were officially sent off to validators.\nMEV, or maximal extractable value, is sometimes known as an “invisible tax” that validators and builders can collect from users by reordering or inserting transactions in a block before they’re added to the blockchain.\nSometimes the practice is compared with frontrunning in traditional stock markets, but due to the difficulty of eradicating it completely, the Ethereum community has more or less accepted the practice, and simply tried to minimize the deleterious effects.\nOne of those mitigating strategies is through the use of MEV-Boost, a software program used by roughly 90% of Ethereum validators. The idea is that all comers could earn MEV more equitably.\nSuch a this-is-just-how-it\u0027s-done attitude was explicitly acknowledged by the prosecutors in their charging document.\n\"Tampering with these established MEV-Boost proposals, which are relied upon by the vast majority of Ethereum users, threatens the stability and integrity of the Ethereum blockchain for all network participants,\" according to the indictment.\nOn Ethereum, users submit transactions that are added to a \"mempool” – an area where transactions are in a holding pattern.\nMEV-boost lets \"block builders\" assemble those mempool transactions from the mempool and put them into blocks.\nThen, MEV bots, or \"searchers,” look into the mempool and assess which transactions could make profitable trades, and sometimes bribe those block builders to rearrange or insert certain transactions to squeeze out some extra profits. Ethereum validators then take those blocks from MEV-boost and ink them to the chain, where they become irreversible.\nAll these steps are typically executed automatically by the software in fractions of seconds.\nWhat the Peraire-Bueno brothers did in this case was target three MEV bots who didn’t have certain checks in place, and set up 16 validators designed to entice the bots.\nWhen the searchers bundle transactions together, they have a target transaction, a signed transaction before it, and a signed transaction after.\n“The rules of the game are, ‘Well, I give you this bundle, and the bundle has to execute atomically,’ meaning it will only go if all three transactions are included in exactly this order, and any other thing than that, it\u0027s not going to work,” Matt Cutler, the CEO of Blocknative, a blockchain infrastructure firm, told CoinDesk in an interview.\nBecause the brothers set up malicious validators, their intent was always to seize on the opportunity to exploit the bots that did not have those checks, by pulling apart those transactions.\n“Because the honeypot transactions were very lucrative, and the bots didn\u0027t have checks in place to prevent certain conditions from happening, and they fundamentally trusted the integrity of the validator and MEV-boost ecosystem, the malicious validator got access to signed transactions that were secured and they were then able to manipulate those signed transactions to drain the bots of $25 million of funds,” Cutler said.\nIn its allegations, the government went out of its way to demonstrate that the activities – targeting a crucial juncture of the blockchain\u0027s inner workings, at a level that\u0027s technical even for experienced blockchain developers – diverged from the community norms, and into the realm of fraud.\nSpecifically, the brothers were accused of sending a \"false signature\" in lieu of a valid digital signature to a crucial player in the chain known as a \"relay.\" A signature is needed to reveal the contents of a proposed block of transactions – including all of the potential profits contained inside the bundle.\n\"In this process, a relay acts in a manner similar to an escrow account, which temporarily maintains the otherwise private transaction data of the proposed block until the validator commits to publishing the block to the blockchain exactly as ordered,\" the prosecutors wrote. \"The relay will not release the transactions within the proposed block to the validator until the validator has confirmed through a digital signature that it will publish the proposed block, as structured by the builder, to the blockchain.\"\nBased on their research and planning, the prosecutors alleged, the brothers \"knew that the information contained in the false signature was designed to, and did, trick the Relay to prematurely release the full content of the proposed block to the defendants, including the private transaction information,\" according to the indictment.\nAs Cutler put it, “Stealing is stealing, regardless of the terms that enable that stealing.”\n“Just because your car door is unlocked, doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s okay to break into your car, right?” he said.\nEthereum is often susceptible to some controversial MEV trading practices, like front-running and so-called sandwich attacks. But many leading figures in the MEV ecosystem view the exploit that took place last year as pure theft.\nTaylor Monahan, a lead product manager at MetaMask, wrote on X that “Yes, if you steal and launder $25 million dollars you should expect to go to prison for a long time lmfao.”\n“It’s a little bit robbing the robbers you could arguably say, but regardless it was clearly an exploit, a manipulation of rule sets, in a manner that is seen to be in violation of established laws of the jurisdiction, right,” Cutler said.\nAlmost to underscore the point, the government alleged that in the weeks following the exploit, Anton Peraire-Bueno \"searched online for, among other things, \u0027top crypto lawyers,\u0027 \u0027how long is us statue [sic] of limitations,\u0027 \u0027wire fraud statute / wire fraud statute [sic] of limitations,\u0027 \u0027fraudulent Ethereum addresses database\u0027 and \u0027money laundering statue [sic] of limitations.\u0027\"\nThe prosecution also noted that the day after the exploit, James Peraire-Bueno emailed a bank representative asking “for a safe deposit box that was large enough to fit a laptop.”\nRead more: Brothers Accused of $25M Ethereum Exploit as U.S. Reveals Fraud Charges\n",

    "type": "Learn",
    "summary": "There are a few things that make Jack Dorsey’s vision for Web5 distinct, including not wanting to completely replace Web2 but work with it.\n",
    "content": "The world is still getting its collective head around Web3 – a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls \"Web5\"?\nIt turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey’s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises “an extra decentralized web platform.”\nTo land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 \u003d 5.\nWeb5’s core idea is to “put you in control of your data and identity” – a core tenet of Web3’s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet’s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS.\nDorsey’s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data “captive in app silos,” Web5 pushes for “a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.”\nThere are three pillars at Web5’s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017.\nSo, what’s new here – apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey’s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any “special utility tokens or subjective consensus” that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service.\nIn doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin’s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5’s nascent community already balked at TBD’s attempt to trademark the term Web5.\nThe other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5’s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user’s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform.\nTBD’s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to “help her visualize her itinerary.” Again, the idea is to tie data that’s usually locked inside centralized services – something TBD calls “a massive, unworkable mess” – to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user’s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes.\nWill it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that’s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS).\nOne of the key things that distinguish TBD’s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it’s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5’s announcement: “Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It’s like a high school student saying ‘yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it’s meant to be.’ It’s naive.”\n",

The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March.\nSuch a move, coupled with demand from traditional finance, could see bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,700.\n“We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of nearly $74,000,” QCP traders said. “The desk saw sizeable buyers of $100K-$120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot.”\n“Institutional demand for bitcoin continues to grow, with large asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld investing approximately 3% and 2% of their AUM into the BTC spot ETF,” they added.\nMultiple filings on Wednesday showed that several big-name funds, such as Millenium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios.\nMeanwhile, some analysts say the selling pressure on bitcoin appears to have eased off, citing on-chain and exchange data.\n“Short-term Bitcoin holders are selling at basically zero profit and traders are depleting their unrealized profits in the last few months,” CryptoQuant analysts shared in a Thursday report. “Bitcoin balances at OTC desks stabilizing, which suggests there is less Bitcoin supply coming into the market to sell via these entities.”\nThe firm defines short-term traders as addresses that hold bitcoin for less than 155 days and are likely to capitalize on short-term price movements.\nA breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility.

    "type": "Consensus Magazine",
    "summary": "Known for her fiery dissenting opinions, \"Crypto Mom\" discusses how the SEC operates, why she wants to see crypto thrive and her \"Safe Harbor\" proposal to allow projects to decentralize.\n",
    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is not a monolithic institution. Look no further than Hester Peirce (a.k.a. Crypto Mom), who is currently serving her second term as one of five overseeing commissioners. Over the past several years, Peirce has made a reputation as a defender of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology — writing innumerable dissenting opinions regarding the many legal actions the SEC has waged against crypto protocols and companies.\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce will speak at Consensus 2024 this May. Grab your pass here.\nTo some extent, Peirce’s disagreements with SEC Chair Gary Gensler stem from their varying philosophical and political beliefs. Peirce, a Republican and member of the Federalist Society, thinks the government should have a limited hand in regulating commerce. Whereas Gensler, who swims in Democratic circles, is often harder to pin down. While Gensler has seemingly evolving opinions on crypto (having appeared as a blockchain supporter while teaching the subject at MIT), Pierce has remained steadfast in her support of economic innovation.\n“It’s a fundamental American principle that people are free to make choices. The government is not there to protect people from their own choices,” Peirce told CoinDesk in an interview. This view colors Peirce’s opinions on whether the SEC should block spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs), go after U.S.-based exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken as well as what role agency should play in overseeing crypto markets.\nCoinDesk caught up with Commissioner Peirce ahead of Consensus 2024, where she’s scheduled to speak this May, to discuss the SEC’s enforcement actions, her distaste of Big Banks and where U.S. crypto regulation first went wrong.\nHi mom. To start off with an easy one, would you be able to describe the fundamental split in opinion that you have with SEC Chair Gary Gensler?\nIt\u0027s not an easy question.\nJust to start out, look, the views I represent and will reflect are my own views, not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow commissioners, so I can\u0027t speak for anyone else at the commission.\nAre you talking about crypto specifically or about the universe of issues?\nI wanted to maybe widen the scope. What are your fundamental political or philosophical differences?\nSo, in terms of philosophy — I have the view that I don\u0027t necessarily know what\u0027s best for other people. We have our statutory mandates that we have to implement. But within those mandates, we\u0027re often given discretion. And if we have discretion, my preference is to say, well, let\u0027s let market participants make a decision about what they want to do. Now, sometimes there\u0027s a reason that we have to step into the middle of a transaction, and say “No, you can\u0027t do that” or “Yes, you can do it, but you have to do it in this particular way.” But we better have a really good reason for stepping into the middle of that transaction.\nSee also: SEC in \u0027Enforcement-Only Mode\u0027 for Crypto, Commissioner Peirce Says\nIt’s a fundamental American principle that people are free to make choices. The government is not there to protect people from their own choices. It\u0027s there to protect people if someone else harms them, but not to make their life decisions for them.\nIn the past, you\u0027ve been critical of big banks but have also argued that the regulatory response to the Great Financial Crisis was offbase. I’m wondering if this somehow connects to your interest in crypto?\nI think my interest in crypto stems from a couple of things. First, I think it\u0027s a good test for how we handle innovation — or maybe a bad test in the sense that I think we\u0027re not passing it. Crypto came to us with a lot of new players and a lot of new ideas. I think we should have figured out how to work with these new players and figure out a way how they could do what they wanted to do in a way that would be compliant, but also allowed them to move forward.\nThere is a connection in the sense that when I look at the financial crisis — a lot of people have looked at it and come to different conclusions about the causes — one of the things going on was poor regulatory design. A regulatory design that led to everyone making the same dumb mistake at the same time. One way to address that is to build resilience into the system, and having heterogeneity in the system is a good way to build resilience. There are some interesting concepts within crypto that allow for more decentralization of the financial system.\nSo yes, in that sense, there\u0027s a connection. But do I think that the decentralized future is going to replace centralized intermediaries in the financial system? My prediction would be not; people want to deal with a centralized intermediary. But I think that there will be a role for decentralized finance. Maybe it\u0027s in the background. Maybe it’s more than that. I predict most people will access it through a centralized intermediary. I could be wrong.\nYou don\u0027t have to answer this question, but do you hold cryptocurrencies?\nBecause I work on these issues all the time. I do not, and would not even if I could. I feel like there\u0027d be a conflict. If you work on these issues, you can\u0027t have crypto, basically. I\u0027m speaking only for what the rules are that apply to me.\nA question from my editor: Prometheum; what\u0027s going on there? Is this an example of the SEC picking winners?\nI\u0027m not going to speak to any particular entity. Nice try.\nThat\u0027s fair enough. Your Safe Harbor proposal is common sense, but in the intervening years since you\u0027ve published it, I think it\u0027s arguably become clear that maybe three years is too short of a time for protocols to decentralize. Solana, Cardano, even Ethereum to an extent have centralized entities directing development — the non-profit organizations founded alongside the network. Do you think we should be thinking about decentralization on a longer timeline? Decades?\nAgain, decentralization is not an end in itself. It is the right thing in certain circumstances. However, sometimes having a centralized entity is the right thing. We should all take a step back and think about what we\u0027re trying to achieve. And fundamentally, what we need to achieve is the ability for people to know whether or not they\u0027re dealing with a security, so when they do something or sell something they understand whether it’s a securities offering.\nThey need to know that in the primary and secondary markets. Then, if we decide that certain crypto assets are securities, or that it doesn\u0027t make sense to adjust the rules, there is a sensible framework that makes sense for crypto assets. Does it make sense to set up some sort of disclosure regime for centralized entities? That\u0027s really a congressional decision. But we can\u0027t even really have these conversations at the SEC right now because the conclusion is just to apply exactly the same rules that apply to stocks and be done with it — and I just don\u0027t think that works.\nBut just taking a step back and thinking about what we\u0027re really trying to solve might take some pressure off the decentralization question.\nHow closely do you or the other four commissioners work with the Enforcement Division. Do you suggest cases to litigate?\nSo, just to give you a sense of how things work on the enforcement side. As with the rulemaking side, it\u0027s the staff that does the bulk of the work. They consider a rule and will propose it for us and we\u0027ll consider it. Often the vote happens at a public, open meeting. With enforcement actions, we also get recommendations. Typically, the staff will recommend authorizing an enforcement action and settling it at the same time. So we often don\u0027t see the case until the end, and are not involved in the guts of the matter. So we\u0027re either going to authorize the division to sue or authorize you to sue and settle with them on the same day. Most of our cases settle like that right away. The voting happens in a process called seriatim, where we\u0027re just voting on the papers, or we vote at a meeting where we have a discussion, but those meetings are, as you might guess, not open to the public.\nSo in a way, if there was a change in the presidential administration in the upcoming election, then the current enforcement regime could continue, more or less, as is?\nI think these are great questions because the structure of the agency is a little strange. Strange in the sense that it\u0027s not like a lot of other agencies that have a single head. But while there are five of us commissioners, Chair Gensler does have the authority to set the rulemaking agenda and staff also report to him. The chair can certainly push the direction that things go, but you\u0027re right, it\u0027s not as if when a new chairman comes in all the existing enforcement investigations just stop. The agency is designed to keep going.\nWould you take the job if Trump or Tulsi were elected?\nThat\u0027s not even on the radar.\nNo?\nYeah, I\u0027m focused on The Now, and trying to try to shift us to a better place. I\u0027ve been here for six years, and it\u0027s very discouraging to see that we have not taken a productive path at all. To me, it\u0027s inevitable that we\u0027ll have to take a productive path at some point — so why not start now? What are we waiting for?\nThis isn\u0027t a question about the present, but I am curious in what ways the agency has changed since your first couple of stints during the early 2000s at the SEC?\nOver the years we\u0027ve gotten progressively more prescriptive in our rulemaking approach. An issue I raised in a speech last week is that we\u0027ve gotten less willing to engage on some of the difficult issues with the staff and the public. That has not been a positive set of changes.\nIs there any reason to believe or to hope that the spot market ETH ETF process won\u0027t unfold similarly to what happened with the spot market bitcoin ETFs?\nI can\u0027t talk about that one because we\u0027ve got some applications under consideration.\nDo you think the 2017 DAO Report set the crypto regulation off on the wrong foot?\nYeah, I do. Because I think that the facts of the DAO Report are different from the facts of most crypto offerings that we see, right? The facts were unique. And I just don\u0027t think that the legal analysis that we\u0027ve applied to thinking about tokens has been helpful for really getting to the crux of the issue.\nSee also: SEC Blasts \u0027Purportedly Decentralized\u0027 DAOs in $1.7M Barnbridge Settlement\nSo if I could rewind — I wasn\u0027t here at the time of the DAO report, though I’ve learned a lot in that time — I would change the way we approach things.\nDo you agree with Judge Failla’s interpretation in the XRP case, that tokens aren\u0027t necessarily securities, but when you sell them to qualified investors it’s an investment contract?\nWell, again, because that\u0027s litigation, I don\u0027t want to talk about any particular judge\u0027s opinion. But as I have said, in other contexts, when you think about an investment contract, whether it\u0027s a digital asset or some other kind of a tangible asset, the asset itself is not the security on its own. It’s when you offer that asset along with an investment contract that’s what makes a security a security. It becomes the object at the center of the investment contract. But you still have to think about those two things as distinct. The orange groves in Howey were not on their own securities.\nYour dissenting opinions are often quite artful. Was it your idea or your co-author Mark Uyeda’s idea to include a play in the ShapeShift document?\nI can\u0027t answer that question either.\nThanks again for your time.\nWell, I appreciate you taking the time and I hope you have a great afternoon.\n",

    "summary": "Following the SEC charges against the world’s largest crypto exchange, people are wondering what’s the difference between Binance and Binance.us, who is Changpeng Zhao and more.\n",
    "content": "Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who is often referred to as just “CZ,” Binance is the world\u0027s leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of June 2023. The company was originally based in China but had to leave Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions shortly after its launch.\nBinance developed its own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (later renamed to BNB Chain), which facilitates trades on the exchange. The native token of the blockchain is Binance coin (BNB) and the company has also launched a stablecoin, BinanceUSD (BUSD). Because of U.S. regulatory rules, Binance created a supposedly separate company for its U.S. clients in 2019, Binance.US.\nOn June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US as well as CZ, who serves as Binance CEO, on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering BNB and BUSD to the general public, calling them unregistered securities. The SEC lawsuit also casts fresh doubt on the independence of the company’s U.S. arm and its staking service.\nRead more about the SEC suit here\nThis is not Binance’s first battle with U.S. regulators. Binance is also under ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who sued CZ and Binance in March 2023, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S.\nHere is everything you need to know about Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao.\nCZ is a well-known personality in crypto, actively engaging with the crypto community through Twitter and speaking at conferences and to the media. As for his origins, he was born in China and emigrated to Canada when he was 12 and says he is a Canadian citizen. In high school, he worked part-time at McDonald’s, which is part of his well-known lore. He graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science.\nAfter college, he worked for the Tokyo stock exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook developing software for the businesses. He then founded a startup in 2005, Fusion Systems, which focused on creating an automated high-frequency trading platform. Following that, he worked for several crypto startups including a stint as co-founder and CTO of OKCoin. Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.\nAccording to the white paper, Zhao\u0027s goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support.\nShortly after Binance’s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper.\nBinance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China’s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance’s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based.\nBinance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance\u0027s proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange.\nBinance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance’s services.\nOne of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange.\nThe other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees.\nFinally, unlike Binance’s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange.\nJuly 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO.\nJuly 2018: Binance acquires Trust Wallet, a free, non-custodial mobile wallet to support its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) offering.\nJanuary 2019: Binance starts to offer support for new token listings through ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings), through its Launchpad product.\nApril 2019: Binance migrates BNB from Ethereum to its proprietary chain, then called Binance Smart Chain (now rebranded to Binance chain or BNB chain)\nApril 2019: Binance launches its DEX ahead of schedule.\nMay 2019: Binance gets hacked for the first time. Hackers steal over 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) from Binance (the equivalent of roughly $41 million at the time). Zhao quickly took to social media to reassure users that no one lost funds and that Binance used its reserve funds to cover the costs of the stolen crypto. CZ\u0027s \"Funds are #SAFU\" tweet has become a meme in the crypto space.\nJune 2019: Binance announces it will launch a new trading platform for U.S. customers, in partnership with a firm called BAM Trading Services.\nJuly 2019: Binance hires former Ripple executive, Catherine Coley, to run its planned U.S. marketplace.\nSeptember 2019: Binance launches its own dollar-backed stablecoin, BUSD in partnership with the Paxos Trust Company.\nSeptember 2019: Binance.US launches in 37 states. The new marketplace supports six cryptocurrencies at launch: bitcoin, (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and BNB. BUSD is notably not supported at launch.\nApril 2020: Binance buys CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data provider, for a rumored $400 million, making it one of the biggest M\u0026A deals in crypto. “CoinMarketCap has more users than any other product in the crypto space,” Zhao said at the time. “It’s a very valuable platform.”\nSeptember 2020: Binance rolls out Launchpool, a crypto staking platform.\nNovember 2020: Binance notifies U.S. customers they have a hard deadline of two weeks to migrate to the new platform before Binance shutters their accounts.\nApril 2021: Binance.US hires Brian Brooks as CEO to replace Catherine Coley in the role.\nAugust 2021: Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks quits over “strategic differences” after just months in the job.\nSeptember 2021: Binance.US promotes Brian Schroder to CEO; he formerly served as president and board member for the firm.\nApril 2022: Binance.US raises $200 million in its first funding round, giving it a $4.5 billion valuation.\nSeptember 2022: Binance announces it will stop supporting the second-largest stablecoin USDC and automatically convert customer funds to BUSD.\nOctober 2022: Binance suffers another major hack, and had to briefly halt trading on BNB after a “potential exploit” drained $100 million in crypto.\nOctober 2022: Binance confirms it has contributed $500 million towards Elon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter.\nNovember 2022: Amidst the collapse of FTX, there was a brief moment when Binance was going to buy the rival exchange. That deal quickly collapsed as the scope of FTX’s issues came to light.\nDecember 2022: Binance.US reaches an agreement to buy Voyager Digital\u0027s assets for just over $1 billion. Voyager, had gone into bankruptcy earlier in 2022 and originally had agreed to sell its assets to FTX, which folded itself.\nFebruary 2023: BUSD issuer Paxos is hit with a one-two punch of an investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice from the SEC, which some believed hinted at Binance as a future target for the SEC. Following these actions, Paxos halted minting BUSD.\nMarch 2023: The CFTC sues CZ and Binance over allegations that the company offered unregistered crypto derivatives products.\nApril 2023: Rumors of an Interpol “Red Notice” for CZ tank BNB price, but there is little to back up the claim.\nApril 2023: Binance.US pulls out of a $1 billion deal to buy Voyager Digital’s assets, attributing the termination to the \"hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.\"\nJune 2023: The SEC files charges against Binance.US and its founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws with BNB token and Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin. The suit also alleges that Binance\u0027s staking service violated securities law as well as that the entities of Binance.US and Binance were not truly independent.\n",

    "type": "Policy",
    "summary": "The Nigerian court also ruled that the Binance exchange can be served the FIRS tax evasion charges through its executive Tigran Gambaryan.\nTigran Gambaryan’s bail was refused by a Nigerian court on Friday.\nNigeria has taken Binance and its executives to court and is pursuing tax evasion and money laundering charges.\n",
    "content": "Detained Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan’s bail application was denied by a Nigerian court on the grounds that there is a likelihood that he will manage to jump bail, the spokesperson for the executive’s family said on Friday.\nBinance and the executives’ money laundering, tax evasion and the exchanges detained Head of Compliance Tigran Gambaryans bail hearings all occurred on Friday in Nigeria. The court ruled that Binance can be served with the Federal Inland Revenue Service tax evasion charge through Gambaryan.\nTigran’s lawyers objected to the application on the grounds that they needed to review the amended charge to advise Gambaryan on taking his plea. The court agreed to adjourn the matter to May 22 for arraignment, where charges are formally laid against the defendant.\nGambaryan, who turned 40 on Friday, has been detained in Nigeria since February when he arrived with the British-Kenyan regional manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla. Anjarwalla has since escaped.\n“I truly cannot believe that my innocent husband is now - on his 40th birthday - having to face a trial for charges that he has nothing to do with,” said Yuki Gambaryan, the wife of Tigran Gambaryan.\n“The whole world is watching what he is being put through, and I just pray that common sense and justice will prevail and that Tigran will be allowed to come home to us.”\nA month after the exchange’s executives were detained in the country, they, along with the exchange, were charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Gambaryan was later moved to Kuje prison, which also houses the likes of members of the Boko Haram terrorist group.\nNigeria’s Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) money laundering trial commenced on Friday with a Nigerian prosecutor who called on Abdulkadir Abbas from the Nigerian SEC as the first prosecution witness.\nAfter the prosecution finished examining their first witness, Tigran’s lawyers asked for a stand down—which means to put a matter on hold for a short while—to obtain certified records of certain documents in the proof of evidence to be used in their cross-examination of the witness. The court adjourned the trial until May 23 at noon.\n“We are deeply disappointed that Tigran Gambaryan, who has no decision-making power in the company, continues to be detained. Tigran has been dedicated to public service and fighting crime for most of his life. These charges against him are completely meritless. He should be freed while discussions continue between Binance and Nigerian government officials,\" a Binance Spokesperson said.\nBinance’s CEO Richard Teng recently released a blog post calling on the Nigerian government to release Gambaryan.\nRead more: Binance CEO Teng Says Nigeria Must Release Gambaryan, Detention Sets \u0027Dangerous New Precedent\u0027\nUPDATE (May 17, 13:12 UTC): Adds meaning of arraignment to third paragraph. Adds full form of EFCC to the eighth paragraph.\n\n",
